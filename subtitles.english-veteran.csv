"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_psy_a_b_01","The trigger finger never gets tired."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_psy_a_d_01","Yeah? Well, I'm a soldier. This is what I know."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_vet_b_b_01","See? I knew those hours of practice'd pay off."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_vet_b_d_01","You never change, do you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_zea_a_b_01","One less heretic, eh?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_zea_a_d_01","Yeah. We'll kill 'em together, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_male_vet_a_c_01","Me? I don't get jealous."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_vet_a_c_01","Not me. You cheat as much as Masozi."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_vet_a_e_01","You're right. She don't deserve that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_vet_a_c_01","No need to be superior. The Guard's the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_01_b_01","This? ... Nothing but a scratch."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_01_d_01","I hear you. "
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_02_b_01","Goes with being in the guard, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_02_d_01","Born ready. "
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_03_b_01","Yeah? Well, I'm gonna get 'em better. Just watch."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_03_d_01","Now that's what I like to hear!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_04_b_01","Tougher than I look, that's me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_04_d_01","Come here and say that!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_05_a_01","You got another round in you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_05_c_01","Might not have one to give, but I'll do my best."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_06_a_01","You're gonna need some serious meds when we get back. "
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_06_c_01","You stow that defeatist talk, soldier. You hear me?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_07_a_01","Stop trying to be a hero, would you? Making the rest of us look bad."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_07_c_01","Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself. "
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_08_a_01","Now you ain't gonna make me carry you back, are you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_08_c_01","Will be if you take another wallop like that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_legend_b_01","Lucky old Atoma, that's what I say."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_legend_d_01","That's what I thought ... More oblivious to sarcasm than a servo-skull."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_lessons_a_01","Look … maybe you should let me give you some marksmanship lesson. You know, improve your aim?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_lessons_c_01","Yeah, that’s the whole point. Never give a heretic an even break, you know?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_arrogance_b_01","You? Humble? Now I've seen everything."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_arrogance_d_01","No. I mistake your arrogance for arrogance. But I never said I didn't like it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_bombs_b_01","Probably not even then. Clock's ticking. They'll bomb this place flat before they let the heretics take it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_bombs_d_01","Oh, it's not like we'll feel anything. Not for long."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_chance_a_01","Look, you've served a long time. How do you see all this going?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_chance_c_01","Yeah, I'd a feeling you'd say that. Let's hope we make it out the other side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_charm_a_01","This gun of mine still ain't working right. I need to take it up with Hadron."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_charm_c_01","You've just got to talk to her right - you know, lay on the charm."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_compliment_a_01","Tell you the truth, I never much cared for Ogryns, but you're different."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_compliment_c_01","Those were his exact words?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_compliment_e_01","Ain't rightly sure that was a compliment."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_contest_a_01","Still with me, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_contest_c_01","That's what I like to hear. Want to make a contest of it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_crazy_b_01","I mean, sure. But look at us. Ain't none of us exactly what you'd call sane, are we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_crazy_d_01","Rather makes my point for me, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_a_01","I'm bushed. I don't know where you get your energy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_c_01","Don't suppose you'd see your way clear to sharing it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_to_eye_b_01","You and your eye-to-eye fixation. Sooner or later something big and ugly is going to wallop you flat."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_to_eye_d_01","And ""distance"" is mine. Happy to share it, if you change your mind."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_following_a_01","Feel like I keep running into you a lot down here, Priest ... Hang about, are you following me?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_following_c_01","Try that again, but with feeling."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_following_e_01","Yeah ... That's what they all say. And it's always a lie. Just admit it to yourself. You'll feel better."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friends_a_01","If you get pinned down, don't be shy. Give me a holler and I'll come in guns blazing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friends_c_01","Awww. Look at us, becoming friends. Warms the cockles, it does."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_going_to_hel_a_01","Don't know about you, but it seems to me this whole mission's going to hel in a hand cannon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_going_to_hel_c_01","I'd rather trust to my team. So are you up for this?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_going_to_hel_e_01","Now that's what I wanted to hear."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_good_team_b_01","Of course we do. Any team I'm on is a good team."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_good_team_d_01","What for? Don't exactly make you bullet proof, does it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grave_mystery_a_01","Go here. Do this. Kill that ... What a life. Always bossed around and no one listening to a word we say."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grave_mystery_c_01","See, that's what I'm afraid of. Just a grunt, ain't I? And the only thing a grunt's worth is an unmarked grave."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grave_mystery_e_01","If you're trying to be a comfort, you're doing it wrong."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grenades_b_01","I don't reckon they trust us to use 'em proper."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grenades_d_01","True. Not exactly soldierly, are they? Not like us."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hangover_b_01","Yeah. Knee deep in filth and heretics. Ammo's scarce and I've got one hel of a hangover."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hangover_d_01","Oi! Enough of that. I'm just feeling a bit ... delicate. You understand?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hangover_f_01","Yeah, I bet."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_impatience_b_01","Woah, woah, woah. Calm down. Better living and late than early and dead."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_impatience_d_01","Course it is. You can tell, because we're the ones that are still breathing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_irony_b_01","I know what you mean. Who'd have thought serving the Inquisition brought greater life expectancy?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_irony_d_01","Good point. Irony's the deadliest sniper going."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leaders_a_01","If you ask me, we should be going after the Moebians' leaders. You know, cut the head off the snake."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leaders_c_01","We ain't got the numbers for any of this, but we forge on all the same."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leaders_e_01","Rather you than me. She's been in one of her moods lately."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_b_01","I know what you mean. This all looks the same, don't it? Then again, Morrow ain't shouting at us so--"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_d_01","Spoke too soon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_f_01","Just hates me, that's all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mood_a_01","You've got a face on you. What's the problem?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mood_c_01","Then this is your lucky day. No shortage of things to smash."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pet_b_01","You big softy ... Here, how about one of them Zealots? They always sound like they need a good hug. "
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pet_d_01","Now you're talking, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_politics_a_01","You been hearing what I've been hearing? About what's going on up-spire?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_politics_c_01","Mine neither, but when the noble houses start chattering about overthrowing the planetary governor, everyone gets a piece of what follows."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_premonition_a_01","Stick close to me, Big Man. I've got a bad feeling about what's up ahead."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_premonition_c_01","You know, a premonition. That nasty, itchy feeling that some Dreg's got her sights lined up on the back of your bonce."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_b_01","That's how it goes, right enough. Still, it's okay once you find the rhythm."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_d_01","Then I reckon this is going to be a very purposeful day. Lucky you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_quarrel_b_01","Oh, you know how it is - a lady never tells."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_quarrel_d_01","Sorry. My lips are sealed."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rats_b_01","Yeah. Feels good being part of a team again instead of a caged rat."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rats_d_01","Thanks. I was trying to forget that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_redemption_b_01","Try not to worry about it. ""Redemption"" is just a word. People like us don't get to pick and choose. We just put the boot in and get our retaliation in first."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_redemption_d_01","We're talking heretics, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_redemption_f_01","Ah."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_saint_b_01","Why not? Anything's possible. Why do you care? You'll be dead."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_saint_d_01","And here was me thinking you just wanted a statue. Throne! Your head is a bag of ptera squirrels and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_shot_at_a_01","You're looking a bit glum. Let me guess - the nasty reality of soldiering's setting in."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_shot_at_c_01","But ... ?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_shot_at_e_01","Awww. You shouldn't mind the shooting. Save that for the ""getting hit""."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_snappy_b_01","That's snappy. Spend all morning thinking that up, did you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_snappy_d_01","That's me convinced. Besides, not counting damnation, seems to me we've plenty of that in our ranks too."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_snappy_f_01","Somehow I knew you were going to say that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_spelling_a_01","You just don't give up, do you Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_spelling_c_01","Can you spell many words?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_talking_b_01","I've had better days, but I'm not dead yet."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_talking_d_01","Probably for the best."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_talking_f_01","Yeah, corpses are lippy buggers - especially when they're not really corpses at all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_teeth_b_01","Yeah. Nice, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_teeth_d_01","Oh. Right ... Scary, are they?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_teeth_f_01","And the search for a sane Zealot continues ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vigilance_a_01","You've noticed how one of your fellow Priests keeps watching me, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vigilance_c_01","Yeah. ""Vigilance"". That's what it is. Sure."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vigilance_e_01","Now hang on. I didn't say I didn't like it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_worse_a_01","Well, this could be going better."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_worse_c_01","Well ... yeah. But then it can always get worse. That's life in the Guard, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_perfectist_b_01","Couldn't arrange to stand a little bit in front of me, could you? Block a couple of shots. Their shots, that is. Not mine."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_perfectist_d_01","Keeping her head down, that's what. Like a normal person."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_remembrance_b_01","Remember you? I've still got your bleeding battle-cry echoing around my brain."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_remembrance_d_01","Is that right? Then again, could just be that you're dead loud, couldn't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_attention_a_01","Oi! Witch! Are you paying any attention to what's going on?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_attention_c_01","And what's that supposed to mean, exactly?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_broken_b_01","This thing here's the only thing I can rely on. I ain't never letting it go."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_broken_d_01","The Guard don't break. Not ever."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_head_down_a_01","Oi, Psyker! If you don't want to get shot, keep that big head down!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_head_down_c_01","Hard to say. I'm not sure all your dogs are barking, if I'm honest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_old_days_a_01","I'm glad to be fighting alongside a proper soldier again. Reminds me of the good old days."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_old_days_c_01","... bad officers, evil bloody commissars, dreggy rations ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_scars_b_01","Yeah? Well, a life in the Guard's like the scars it gives you: never leaves."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_scars_d_01","I wouldn't know. I just shoot stuff."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_spiders_a_01","I've told you before: stay where I can see you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_spiders_c_01","Well. I wasn't, but now? ... Would you really do that?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_scoring_b_01","Well, I guess I'll give you a perfect score for situational awareness, but a somewhat lower one for ""cause and effect""."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_scoring_d_01","The bloody heretics are always nearby, you scalded gyrinx! ... Emperor give me strength."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_shooting_back_a_01","The way I see it, the more heretics we kill, the less of them there are shooting back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_shooting_back_c_01","Don't knock being obvious. That's the kind of thing keeps you alive in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_smear_a_01","You've got to stop rushing in like that. Makes you a target."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_smear_c_01","No. It ain't. Catch enough hellgun shots and you'll be a greasy smear."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_spy_proof_a_01","Funny how the heretics always know where to find us, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_spy_proof_c_01","Or, you know, it could be the unceasing gunfire and your booming voice."
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_tarry_not_b_01","Not sure I can keep up with you. "
"loc_veteran_female_a__bonding_conversation_tarry_not_d_01","Didn't understand a word of that, but you seem happy enough. Guess that'll do."

"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_gas_b_01","Yeah, it ain't pretty, Big Man. But like usual, we just have to put up with it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_gas_b_02","It ain't exactly easy on the lungs, and that's a fact."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_01","Always thinking with your stomach, ain't you Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_02","A good soldier always knows where his next meal's coming from."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_01","Just makes things interesting, if you ask me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_02","Yeah, but they can't fragging see us, can they?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_01","Still got fragging big teeth, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_02","Don't need training when they've got teeth like that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_a_01","Well, at least this muck ain't poisonous."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_a_02","Could be worse. This fog could be stripping the flesh off our bones."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_01","Yeah, I've seen that before. From a distance, thankfully."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_02","True enough. Maybe the Emperor does love us after all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_a_01","I hate being chased by Hounds. It's so ... undignified."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_a_02","Hounds. It's always fragging Hounds?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_01","I hear you. We work together and we'll get through this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_02","We've got the training. That's what counts."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_01","Quit moaning and get your weapon up! The heretics could be anywhere."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_02","You don't get to choose your battlefield. Or your grave."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_01","There's someone else who likes the sound of their own voice a bit much too. I wonder who I mean ... ?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_02","Something else is barking ... Oh, it's you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_01_b_01","Sure is, but I'm not in this life to stay clear of danger."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_04_b_01","I reckon so, Big Man. You do good work."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_08_b_01","Into as many pieces as you can, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_09_b_01","You're kind of hard to miss."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_15_b_01","Don't we all? No good comes of questioning your betters."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_19_b_01","Just follow my lead, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_02_b_01","It's the only language they understand, true enough."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_03_b_01","Can't argue with that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_05_b_01","There'll be a challenge along soon enough, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_13_b_01","Patience, Big Man. There's plenty yet to be done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_17_b_01","When you're right, you're right."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_19_b_01","Aye, it's a big part of your charm."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_02_b_01","Like the kind that don't send us to certain death?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_03_b_01","What do you think we've been doing, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_05_b_01","Erm... What exactly you been eating, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_13_b_01","I envy you, Big Man. You don't think about the scars on the inside."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_17_b_01","Yes. Yes you are."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_19_b_01","Yeah... It's the bits inbetween that make things complicated."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_03_b_01","Oi! There's nothing wrong with being a soldier!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_06_b_01","It wasn't always this way. You want to blame someone, blame the heretics."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_b_01","It's easy enough to settle into a pattern, ain't it? The screams provide rhythm."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_b_01","Can't argue with that. I prefer a straight fight."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_15_b_01","Oh, I'm sure it'll liven up soon enough."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_18_b_01","Reckon you're in charge, do you? Not while I'm breathing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_03_b_01","Oh, for Throne's sake! This is real!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_06_b_01","If that really is the Emperor you're talking to, you'd do well to listen."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_b_01","Would a nice, hard slap help?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_12_b_01","Like I keep telling you: you're not asleep!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_15_b_01","Hard core violence: best therapy going."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_18_b_01","Way ahead of you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_b_01","That's a luxury. They should try getting deployed to a different world every few weeks."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_b_01","Caring is a luxury we can't afford. Everyone here is under suspicion."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_b_01","You know, Witch, there'll come a time when our orders and the Lex don't play nice together..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_18_b_01","We got more than that. We got orders. Understand?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_01_a_01","Right cosy little place this. Who the Hel lives here by choice?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_a_01","The sights on this gun are off. I can feel it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_b_01","Yeah, substandard clobber left, right and centre. It's a fragging joke."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_03_a_01","Stay together! We're stronger as a team."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_03_b_01","Damn straight! Numbers matter. Discipline matters!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_04_a_01","You lot stick with me, and I'll get you through this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_a_01","Well, this could be going worse. Could be going better, mind."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_b_01","Just another fragging day in the Guard ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_06_a_01","Keep your eyes open. I don't want any nasty surprises."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_a_01","Keep up the pace! We're not done yet."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_08_a_01","No stragglers now! Let's get this done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_a_01","If this is life in a hive city, I'll stick with the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_10_a_01","Throne! Look at the state of all this. Breaks my heart."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_11_a_01","Don't get sloppy! I'm not dragging you back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_12_a_01","Not one of my better days. Just as well no one's keeping score."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_a_01","There'll be more coming, so stay fragging alert!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_b_01","Copy that!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_14_a_01","I'll make soldiers of you lot yet ... assuming you live that long."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_15_a_01","You lot wouldn't last long in the Guard. Then again, most folk don't."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_16_a_01","Oh, this brings back memories. None of them good."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_17_a_01","Can you lot not make less noise? Fragging amateurs."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_17_b_01","Damn right. Let's show a bit of discipline, shall we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_18_a_01","Do me a favour? Keep your heads in the next fire fight."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_19_a_01","Watch your aim, yeah? I've enough problems without fetching a bullet in the back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_19_b_01","A terrible thing, getting shot by your own side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_20_a_01","You lot need more discipline. That's what wins wars."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_03_a_01","You do know we're all gonna die here, don't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_04_a_01","Well, this is fun."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_b_01","Less moaning, yeah? Set an example."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_b_01","And you. I've certainly had worse folk watching my back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_17_b_01","Nothing wrong with that. Keeps you alert."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_19_b_01","There's nothing beats the feel of a bayonet sliding between a heretic's ribs."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_b_01","Got a fine opinion of yourself, don't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_b_01","Good advice. I hope the others are listening."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_17_b_01","Aye. Stay close comrades. Let's get this done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_19_b_01","A soldier without hope's already dead."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_06_b_01","Aye. Kick them slackers to the kerb."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_11_b_01","Too bloody right! We fight for the fragging Throne!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_12_b_01","Blessed be the Emperor!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_12_b_02","We serve the Throne, and in service, find purpose!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_18_b_01","Ain't it just? Good thing that faith will see us through!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_06_b_01","Aye, anger'll see you through dark days, especially with the Emperor at your side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_11_b_01","That we will. Just gotta keeping fighting, comrade!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_12_b_01","And very glad of it I am."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_12_b_02","Praise the Throne! May the Light of Terra guide us!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_18_b_01","Ah ... There you and I will have to part company. Medicae exists for a reason."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_05_b_01","Yeah... But good rations and few extra credits wouldn't go amiss."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_10_b_01","Great! Mine must be white as a fragging Valhallan winter."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_11_b_01","I'll be happy to go down fighting, and let the Emperor judge."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_17_b_01","Not in any department."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Stay alert! We're not out of this yet!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_02","Keep your fragging eyes open!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_03","Stay together! Let's get this mission done!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Keep moving! Let's make Morrow proud!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_05","Watch the shadows! There could be anything out there!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Eyes open, comrades!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_07","We're making good progress!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_08","Work as a team!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_09","Don't give the heretics a fragging inch!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Stick with me and we'll get through this!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","Would you prefer ""Homo Sapiens Gigantus""?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","It's cos you're different. You know, like a Ratling, only the exact opposite."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_a_01","Right. Remember to make your shots count."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_a_02","Get your sights on the target before you pull the trigger."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_a_03","None of this spray and pray, stuff. Make sure you aim, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","Always do."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","Your lips to my ears."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","Maybe you should learn something I like to call 'fire discipline'?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","Pick your targets. It'll last longer."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Will you quit stealing all the ammo?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Oi! The rest of us need some fragging ammo as well, you know!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Did you just take the fragging ammo? Again?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","You'd only misuse it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Don't you tell me what to do!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Just remember who the enemy is, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","Save it for the heretics, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Can't say I disagree. Stay alert."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","You might be right. Let's keep our eyes open."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Reckon you're doing just fine as you are."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","You don't need it, Big Man. You're plenty smart."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Give it time, Big Man. They'll be back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Rest easy, Big Man. This ain't over."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Alright, alright. No need to go showing off."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","No one likes a show-off, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Don't jinx it, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Awww... Why'd you have to say that out loud?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","Glad you take such [ahem] pride in your work, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","I'll stick to the guns, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","It isn't. Now quit your whining."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","You don't know cold until a Commissar looks you dead in the eye."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","You never know, we'll make a soldier of you yet!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","You're getting better, I'll give you that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Tolerance is what got us into this mess."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Looks like they turned a blind eye once too often."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","That's not the Guard spirit. Never say die!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","All the Emperor can ask is that we die fighting!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Stay creepy, comrade. Wouldn't be the same, else."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Oh, the Psyker's off again..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","Heard he saved the lives of over a hundred officers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Most famous bodyguard in the Astra Militarum."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","I'll do what I can, but no promises."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","You talk like that's a small thing, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","Not me. I know my duty."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","You stay put. We've a fragging job to do."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Takes the Guard a while to get moving, you know that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","That's the Astra Militarum for you. Starts slow, stops slow, grinds everything to powder."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_a_01","Next time we engage, try to fight like soldiers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_a_02","I want to see some proper soldiering from here on out, understand?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_a_03","When the next skirmish starts, you follow my lead. Like soldiers. Got it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","Understood."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","Copy that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","Look, a nice big bang just happens to be a great leveller, that's all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Can't go wrong with a pocket-sized explosion."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Bit of faith and steel, that's how we do it in the Guard, eh!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Spoken like a proper soldier. Let's get to work!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","Best not to think about it, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Just focus on the enemy, that's my advice."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Pull yourself together. We need you sober."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","This ain't the time for drinking, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_a_01","It'll be hard fighting before we're done, but the Emperor stands with us."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_a_02","Trust to the Emperor, comrades. He'll see us to victory."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_a_03","It may be bitter work, but at least the Emperor's with us."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","True enough. May he always be our shield."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","The Emperor Protects."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","Watch your mouth. Don't do any good to say such things."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","If that's all you can say, keep it zipped."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","You know how it goes, once the rot sets in, it gets fragging everywhere."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Breaks my heart, it does. So let's break some heads."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","Long as I've ammo and a reliable gun, bring it on."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","That's life in the Guard. Fix bayonets and meet it with steel."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","Heh. Welcome to life in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","Never known anything different. It's a challenge to rise above."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Never mind, Big Man. Could be worse."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Doesn't stop you fighting though, does it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","It's good for clearing trench lines, I know that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Aye. It's like the Emperor's wrath given form. Glorious."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Oh for-- Doesn't matter, Big Man. You're doing great."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Just follow my lead and keep shooting."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","You're not wrong. Best not to think about it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","Above my pay grade, all that. Thank frag."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","It's good to have friends when you're under fire."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You know how it goes, the Guard stands together!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Really putting the ""ab"" in ""abhuman"" there, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","If the enemy don't get you, your lunch sure will."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","Best we can do is put them out of their misery."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","We should put as many down as we can. It's a kindness."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Hang on, hang on! Don't go squandering that medicae!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Oi! Don't go wasting that healing!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","No! Don't waste that fragging healing!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Settle down. Wound was deeper than it looked, weren't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","You'd rather carry me back to the Mourningstar, would you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","You'll get used to it. Everyone does, sooner or later."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Ah, it's not so bad. At least the air's clean. Ish. Sometimes."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","If you think it'll help…"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","All right. You go high, I'll go low."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Be careful what you wish for."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","They'll be back, you wait."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","I'd enjoy the breather, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Don't worry. They'll be back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Don't take this wrong, Big Man, but ... eh ... no."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","It's healthy to have aspirations, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","Aye, and look what good it's done them!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Pity we couldn't have come in better circumstances."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","Whatever you say. Just so long as you keep fighting."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Oh no, who set the Witch off again?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","Won't catch me arguing with that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","Aye, for the fragging Throne!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","I could use a bit of festivity right now, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Pity the corrupt outnumber the faithful."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","No offence, but Psykers ain't exactly the most stable of folk."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","Have you tried being better company? That'd make it easier."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_a_01","Tertium's a grand old lady. She don't deserve this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_a_02","Shame to see Tertium like this. She deserves better."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_a_03","Tertium's another of the Emperor's great works, brought to ruin. Poor lass."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","It's a fragging tragedy, it is."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Got my blood boiling, seeing it like this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","And who's gonna carry the ammo? Not me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Ain't in the regs though, is it? Gotta follow the regs."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","What's wrong with this? Looks good and sturdy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","Don't tell me you're scared of elevators?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","Should fragging hope so, 'cos the pay isn't great."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","Hope he's watching our backs right now."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","Always pays to stay on the Emperor's good side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","I'm very much thankful to still be alive…"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Gladly, but let's be sure it's as quiet as it seems."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Later, Priest. This won't last."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Just how it is, Big Man. Don't worry about it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Can't all be the same, can we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_a_01","Can't shift the taste of those combat rations, even through a mouthful of blood."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_a_02","Can you believe the state of the rations they've got us on?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_a_03","Keep an eye open for grub, comrades. Anything's better than those rations Morrow doles out."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Rotten food, rotten orders. Nothing changes."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Those rations are the reason the army keeps marching. To get away from them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","You stay out of my head, Witch!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","And you might get shot."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Woah, Big Man. I don't think that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","That ain't what I think. Not at all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","Maybe let's get on with winning the war before spinning fantasies like that?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","Sounds nice, but it's gonna be a long road before we get there."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","You want to put your feet up while there's a world in the balance?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","Yeah, I'm sure the heretics are taking time off too."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","You keep your fragging mouth shut."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Not this again. Keep it stowed."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Not again. Can't you stay awake, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Come on, no dawdling on the job, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Can't expect proper soldiering from heretics, can you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Ain't an ounce of courage in a heretic. Not one."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","I'm right behind you, Priest!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Too fragging right!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","With you lot in tow? Fat chance."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","No offence, but I don't think you're up to it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","What did you expect? It's hard work down here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","Sorry about that. Left my perfume back on the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Not sure them make them in your size, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","Ain't rightly sure that's a good idea."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Maybe they can restore it when we're done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","Once, maybe. Bit past her prime these days."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","There's definitely something in that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","Listen to that. Out of the mouths of innocents and untrustworthy mutants ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","There's no understanding scum."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","Heretic scum! Turning aside from the Emperor's Light."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Really? I had a similar experience with a provost."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","Law's just there to keep a body down. Always has been."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","Black marketeering? You're a disgrace to the uniform."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","You can pack that in. Conduct unbecoming, you know."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","You're starting to sound like a fragging Commissar."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","You're only as strong as the soldier next to you. Remember that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","You got real trust issues, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","I miss the old Guard days, when you could trust a fellow soldier."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_a_01","Don't suppose you lot fancy behaving like real soldiers?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_a_02","You lot wouldn't last a day in the Guard, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_a_03","You know? You're a sloppy fragging bunch of fighters."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Says you. It's like looking in a mirror."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","Me? That's rich. Look at you!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_c_01","We're all going to die, ain't we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_c_02","And suddenly this feels like a suicide mission."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_c_03","Nice chat. Nice fragging chat."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_a_01","I know it looks bad, but we're not losing this world."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_a_02","Atoma ain't lost, not while I've got anything to do with it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_a_03","We're gonna throw the heretics outta this place. You'll see."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Damn straight. You can't stop the Astra-fragging-Militarum."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","Ain't that the glorious truth?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_a_01","You know, you lot should keep your weapons in better nick."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_a_02","Don't think I haven't seen the state of your weapons. You should be ashamed."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_a_03","You lot should be up on charges for the state of your weapons."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Speak for yourself. Mine are parade ground ready."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","Oh, hello Mister Kettle. I think you've got us confused."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","I… I'd rather not go there. Not yet."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","I think I'll keep that between me and the Emperor, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","You'll not find me wanting!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","For the Golden fragging Throne!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","Doesn't look that bad to me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","Huh, I've had worse."
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_01","Fragging hel, get back 'ere!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_02","Oi! Where're you goin'?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_03","Get back here, soldier!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_04","Get your worthless arse back here!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_05","Squad up, or you'll answer to me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_06","Come 'ere! Right now!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_07","Stick together, numbskull!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_08","Stay close or die, simple as that!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_09","Don't fragging run off!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__come_back_to_squad_10","Where d'you think you're going?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","Where's the fragging Space Marines? This a job for them, not us."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","It's like I'm back in the Guard. Alone in the dark until the enemy open fire..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","Heard an officer talking about something called the Cicatrix Maledictum earlier on. What's all that about then?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","Yeah. Clear as Frekkian mud."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","Wonder how the war's going? That weren't thunder you heard last night, but the 101st's artillery giving 'em hel."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","Never seen a hive city in one piece like this. They're normally in ruins by the time the Guard get called in."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","I keep hearing whispers of a second hive city, out there in the wastes. Anything in that?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","It's a tough fragger ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","Pour it on! it's gotta die sometime!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Get behind it! Shoot it in the back!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Attack the rear! Go for the weak point!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","I hear you!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Now that's a good fragging idea!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","So ... What do you reckon about Explicator Zola?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Not sure what I think about the explicator ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","She's an odd one. Military, but not military. Could be trouble."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She's not someone I want to cross. Let's put it that way."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","Just try not to get on her bad side, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","I wouldn't pick a fight with her, and that's the fragging truth."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Picked up a rumour ... says Zola came from Atoma. Originally, I mean."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","I heard a thing ... Turns out our explicator's an Atoman native."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Question is, did she leave willingly, or was she on the run?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Everyone's got to be from somewhere."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Really? Always figured her for a woman with hidden shallows."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Hang on ... That sounds like praise."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Well ... You know drop-jockeys, need every favour they can get."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","I guess ... Well, I've never heard of anyone forging relics for filthy profit, not me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","What do you make of our pilot? Seems a bit lippy to me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","That pilot's a character, isn't she? Needs a good dose of discipline."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I reckon we could do much worse. At least she's sober ... I think."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","Drop-jockeys are all the same. Reckon they're the Emperor's gift to us dirt pounders."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Well, we're stuck with her unless Rannick says otherwise."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Maybe I'd better familiarise myself with the Storm Raptor, just in case ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","Probably won't, no."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Is that so?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","What, Brunt? That ornery Catachan? You're right, I don't believe it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","A likely story. Brunt's twice her size."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","What's eating you, then?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","You've got a face like a kicked scav-rat. What's going on?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_02_01","Do yourself a favour - don't play Darktown tarot with that pilot of ours."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_02_02","Fragging pilot! Shouldn't be allowed near a tarot deck!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_02_03","If you see our pilot, tell her I want a word about her card-sharping!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_02_04","That fragging pilot talked me into a game of Darktown tarot."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Oh, here we go."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Oh no, not this again."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_01","Fragging cheats, doesn't she? No one's that lucky."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_02","Never seen cards dance like that, and always to her favour."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_03","Look, she fragging cheats! It's not my fault!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_04","Took me for every scrap of chit. Lucky to keep my damn uniform!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Throne! This thing's even tougher than a regular ogryn!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","This fragging thing won't die!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Plague Ogryns are hardy. Aim for the head!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Go for the head! See if we can't pop the eye right open!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","What do you think I'm trying to do?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Whatever you say!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","Old soldiers have old ghosts. Nothing strange about that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","We've all buried old comrades. Part of the life. Of course, it's better to leave them in the past."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","He'll hold it together. It's us I'm worried about."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","Don't you worry about Morrow. Steel Legionnaires don't know how to quit."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","It is me, or is the sergeant-major more short-tempered than most?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","The sarge seems to be burning on a short fuse ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Morrow's all right. Walks and talks mean, but he's fair."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","It's all front. Always is with his sort. There's a manufactorum somewhere that stamps out NCOs like that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Someone told me Morrow was at Hades Hive with Yarrick, back in the day. You want to annoy him, be my guest. I'll watch."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Trust me - you don't want to cross a hero of Armageddon. The Steel Legion have a good reason for their reputation."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_01","Got talking to one of the sentries. Did you know Morrow was in the middle of the Xanatros Purgation?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_02","So ... I heard Morrow was dab bang in the middle of the Xanatros Purgation."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_03","I've been asking around. Guess what? Morrow was on fragging Xanatros when it all went to hel."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_04","Ain't many of the Inquisitor's lot who'll talk, but one of them said Morrow was on Xanatros when they brought down the fire."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Remind me which one that was? You've seen one cleansing, you've seen 'em all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","Xanatros. Rings a bell, but it ain't like we're short of wars."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_03_01","It was a bad one. Three regiments of Mordian Iron Guard went in - a company of Doom Legion too, I heard. Only it wasn't just secessionists. Xanatros was swarming with Genestealers. Didn't go well."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_03_02","Genestealer cult took over the planet. Better part of three Mordian regiments and a bunch of Space Marines got chewed up taking it back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_03_03","Genestealers. Need I say more?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_03_04","Genestealers. Course, the official word is it was just secessionists, but I served with one of the survivors over in the Moriar Campaign. She set me straight."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","You reckon Morrow was working for the Inquisitor back then?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","Xenos scum. What was Morrow doing there? The Inquisitor's eyes and ears?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_01","Be surprised if that wasn't the case. Let's hope Atoma goes better than Xanatros ... for all our sakes."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_02","Wouldn't bet against it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_03","Seems a dead cert to me. Wonder what happened to the rest of his team?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_04","That ain't the question. The question is, what happened to them who was there with him?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow was at Hades Hive? Must be older than he looks."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow fought in the Second War for Armageddon. He must be old."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","I heard his transport ship got lost in the Warp. Stuck there for centuries. It happens."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","I heard tell he was lost in the Warp. Only survivor of a Golgotha-class transport until the Inquisitor found him."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","Not sure it matters. He's in charge. End of conversation."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Doesn't much matter to us, does it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","That Tech-Priest's an odd sort, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","Never know where I stand with that Tech-Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","I've known worse. Still ... ain't exactly human, is she?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","At least she has a sense of humour ... Sort of."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","We need to stay on her good side, so that's what I'm doing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Not someone I want to wind up, if you follow me?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","Yeah? How well do you think it's going so far?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Could be a bit easier, don't you reckon?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","Prayer's kept me intact all these years. You don't knock what works."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","Won't catch me arguing. Light in the darkness, he is."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","I'll be honest, I understood about a third of that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Well, that was as clear as mud. At best."
"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_01","Cover me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_02","Cover me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_04","Need cover!"

"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_07","Give me some damn cover!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_08","Give me some damn cover!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_09","Cover! Now!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__cover_me_10","Suppressing fire!"

"loc_veteran_female_a__critical_health_04","Losing a lot of blood…"
"loc_veteran_female_a__critical_health_05","Throne, but that hurts!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__critical_health_06","Need to keep going… Need to…"
"loc_veteran_female_a__critical_health_07","Think I might have a problem, here…"
"loc_veteran_female_a__critical_health_08","Oh, that ain't good."
"loc_veteran_female_a__critical_health_09","Need medicae…"
"loc_veteran_female_a__critical_health_10","Need some damn medicae…"
"loc_veteran_female_a__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_veteran_female_a__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_veteran_female_a__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Get it off!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Get it off!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Get it off me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","Get off!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","Get this fragging thing off me!"

"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_08","Help!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","Throne! Help me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","Throne! Help me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_01","Need a hand!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_02","Need a hand!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_03","Can't move… Can't fight..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_04","Free me!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_05","Help me out, would you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_06","Get me free!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_07","You help me, I'll help you!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_08","You help me, I'll help you!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_09","Kill this fragging thing!"

"loc_veteran_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_01","Rager's dead and gone."
"loc_veteran_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_02","Dead Rager!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_03","Rager's a goner. Not so noisy now."
"loc_veteran_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_04","Rager's finished!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_05","We got the Rager!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_06","Rager's gone!"

"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","Know what they say: Infantry win firefights. Tanks win battles. Artillery win wars. Officers lose the lot."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","Ever seen an armoured company rolling out? Brings a tear to the eye..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","Atoma makes a cracking Leman Russ. One of the reasons we're here I reckon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","They make Leman Russ battle-tanks here on Atoma. Good ones, too."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_01","Really miss the Guard. Being part of something bigger."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_02","I like this job, and all, but I miss having the might of the Imperial Guard at my back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_03","What I wouldn't give for the support of my old platoon..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_04","By the Throne, I miss the Guard. They were the days, eh?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","You know where you are with a good platoon structure."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","True. Proper soldiering, none of this sneaking about."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","Not sure about this ""Astra Militarum"" lark, It'll always be the Guard to me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","Few Sentinels. Air support strafing around outside. Boots on the ground... Can't beat it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Be fair, their job is to inspire, as well as... erm... execute cowards."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","I can see how dishing out summary executions could give someone a bad rap..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Nobody likes a Commissar, but you sure as hel better respect them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Someone's gotta keep order. Nobody says it's fair."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","They knew how to get a battle-line fired up, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","Once they started preaching, nothing short of death would stop 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","Did have a funny habit of just walking into enemy fire. Something about armour of faith."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","We lost a fair few preachers. Turns out faith isn't much of a shield, and hate makes poor armour."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_four_b_01","Mate of mine once told me that piracy was just a matter of flags."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_four_b_02","Could be. Things get murky on the frontier."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_four_c_01","Couldn't live that life. I don't have much honour, but it's for keeping."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_four_c_02","I'm more of a ""straight up fight"" sort. If I come for you, it's because you earned it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_a_01","So, I hear that our shipmistress and Grendyl have a complicated relationship."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_a_02","Not sure what to make of things between Brahms and Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_a_03","Grendyl and Brahms have an odd bond ... or so I'm hearing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_a_04","Brahms never quite seems happy to be here, does she?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_b_01","I hear she doesn't want to be here, but Grendyl insisted."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_b_02","Got an old debt to Grendyl, so I was told. She's paying it off."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Reckon I'll steer clear, unless I've no choice."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_one_c_02","I don't want to end up on her bad side, I can tell you that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_three_b_01","From what I can tell, there are vessels from across the Moebian domain docking on a daily basis. Probably weighs on her."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_three_b_02","The Mourningstar's a busy place. Means Brahms has a lot of influence. Stressful, that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_three_c_01","Take my advice: stay on her good side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_three_c_02","I hear she's fair ... But then again, those who think otherwise probably don't last long."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_two_b_01","Best not let Brahms hear you say that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Not something you want our shipmistress to hear."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_two_c_01","Nothing wrong with trading with aliens ... So long as they mind their manners."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Trade's all right. Just so long as we don't pick up their fancy lingo and strange ways."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_four_b_01","They worship some big, disgusting plague-god. Think disease is a blessing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_four_c_01","They're fragging unpredictable. Disease makes 'em feral... dangerous."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_four_c_02","It's the daemons that rattle me. Big, shambling balls of pus... Fragging disgusting."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_a_01","Seems the heretics worship Chaos as gods. But they can't be gods... can they?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_a_02","The way these heretics build shrines and pray to icons... It's like they think daemons are gods or something."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_a_03","The things the heretics worship. They're just daemons, right? I mean... they couldn't really be gods?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_a_04","Tell me the heretics are just misguided, and those things they pray to aren't really gods."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_b_01","No way. They just need the Emperor's light, s'all. Or death; whichever."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_b_02","There's only one fragging god, and He sits on the Golden Throne of Terra."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Ever seen the ones with the 'stigmata'. It's just so fragging depraved..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_one_c_02","Cults always starts out with a few devotees, then it spreads like wildfire. Then you've got a problem."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_three_b_01","When you say ""realm"", you're talking an actual place, where Chaos lives?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_three_b_02","We all know Chaos comes from the Warp... But an actual realm? Sounds kinda crazy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_three_c_01","I usually sleep like a baby during Warp-jumps. Don't ruin it for me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_three_c_02","So, if I have a dream about a daemon sitting on a mountain of skulls, you're saying it comes true in the Warp? [Derisory Laugh]"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_two_c_01","The Guard handbook doesn't really cover fighting Space Marines. They're meant to be on our side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_chaos_two_c_02","But everyone says Space Marines are the ultimate warriors. Virtually unstoppable... Frag..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_four_b_01","Seriously, Big Man? You've never heard of that enormous Warp rift?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_four_b_02","Only the one of the biggest Warp rifts in the galaxy. You been living under a rock?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_four_c_01","Come on... After what happened to Cadia? Too soon..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Look, we try not to think about the Eye of Terror. Not since Cadia..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_one_a_01","Don't reckon we have much to fear from daemons in realspace... do we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_one_a_02","Won't be any daemons here, right? They don't exist outside the Warp... [Nervous laughter]"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_one_a_03","Daemons are stuck in the Warp, right? I mean... They can't get us here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_one_a_04","We're mostly safe from daemons when we're not Warp-jumping... I hope."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_one_c_01","I did hear that thing about Absolom Reach... But that's just a story..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Wait... I remember that story of the fate of the Hameront Fourth... No, can't be true."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_three_b_01","You mean you could become... possessed?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_three_b_02","Throne... You don't mean a Daemon might possess you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_three_c_01","Can we change the subject? Walls have ears, y'know."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_three_c_02","Back in the Guard, just saying this stuff would get you shot."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_two_b_01","If it could happen there, it could happen anywhere... Even here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Never thought I'd live to see Terra besieged."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_two_c_01","Heard two thousand Adeptus Custodes fell... How's that even possible?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_daemons_two_c_02","Lucky the Adeptus Custodes were there, but even they had it rough."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","The Infantryman's primer says He's a god, and that's good enough for me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","We all took the Ordo Hereticus oath, right? The bit about unquestioning loyalty to the Emperor..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","We're the Ordo Hereticus. We shoot people for these sorts of questions, remember?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_01","If things get bad, reckon the Sisters of Battle might lend a hand?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_02","Wonder if we've got enough clout to get the Sisters of Battle down here?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_03","Hope Grendyl's got the Sisters of Battle on standby; just in case, y'know."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_04","Reckon the Sisters of Battle might help us out if things get bad."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","The Chamber Militant of the Ecclesiarchy... Just imagine it!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","The Adepta Sororitas? Here? That'd be something..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","Like to think Grendyl had the clout, but I won't hold my breath."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Right, come on. Daydreaming about the Valorous Heart won't get this job done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Few more Missionaries out there, maybe we'd see less heresy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","Lonely sort of life, though, not like soldiering."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","Takes a lot of planning to convert a lost population. Tough work."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","Hear they work with Rogue Traders. Who knows what they get up to."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","There's no higher honour for the faithful it's said."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Us? Get a commendation from a cardinal? Seems unlikely."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Can't see the Ecclesiarch paying attention to us. He's a fragging High Lord!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","Well, there's this thing called the Godolkin Index which... Never mind."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","Like they taught us in boot camp: If they're funny-looking, they're probably bad."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","Just don't go shooting Navigators or sanctioned psykers - you get into trouble for that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","Psychic mutants are a bit of a grey area, 'specially when they're on our side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","Can't you ever just follow orders without complaining?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","Look, we got orders. If there's heresy here, it's our job to stamp it out."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Even tolerating a heretic is heresy, see. So if you think about it, nobody's really innocent..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Yeah, yeah. Everybody's innocent until you see their Chaos stigmata..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","The Priest's got a point. I mean, they're practically gateways to possession..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","A witch without proper training is an accident waiting to happen."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","I wonder how many psykers slip through the nets of the Black Ships...?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","I've seen even sanctioned psykers lose control. Never ends well for 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","Seriously, Big Man? It's only the biggest mobilisation since the Macharian Crusade."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","It's pretty big news. Don't you pay any attention to the vox?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Still not sure about these Primaris marines though. I mean, like Space Marines weren't big enough..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","How about the Primaris Space Marines? Like a whole fragging army of Guillimans!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_01","Still can't believe Cadia is gone..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_02","Thought Cadia would hold out forever. And now it's gone."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_03","Doesn't seem real that Cadia has gone. Sometimes it just hits me, you know?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_04","Cadia finally fell, huh? So many proud soldiers gone, just like that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Didn't call it the Bastion World 'cos it sounded good. But nothing lasts forever."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","That damned Eye of Terror. Threw every possible horror at Cadia until it fell."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","The battle raged across the whole segmentum. But Cadia bore the brunt."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","They say the Indomitus Crusade is the greatest counter-attack ever!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","They say people just turned into psykers overnight!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Lots of psykers losing control... Losing their minds. And you know what happens after that..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","You know what comes with all this psychic hokum? Fragging Daemons, that's what."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","It's no coincidence we're seeing more daemonic incursions than ever. Throne save us..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","I hear there are whole Space Marine chapters stuck in the Dark Imperium."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","Baal is in the Dark Imperium, right? That means even the Blood Angels are stuck out there."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","We'll get it back. Lord Commander Dante is in charge in the Dark Imperium, and he never loses."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","But they've named Commander Dante as regent of the Dark Imperium, right? He'll get it back, don't you worry."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Good. The more warm bodies we've got, the better the chances of victory."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","As it should be. There's plenty of work to be done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","We're gonna need more. I've a bad feeling about this one."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","Can't have too many soldiers for what's coming."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_01","Grendyl's a mysterious sort, ain't that so?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_02","I've been asking around. No one know much about Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_03","Grendyl ... I wonder who he is. Or she. Or whatever."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_04","Grendyl's a secretive one, no question about that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","Inquisitors have secrets, and they don't like questions."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","So Grendyl's careful? Makes sense to me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","Still, you don't become an Inquisitor by accident. We can trust Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","Don't matter really. Chain of command still applies ... even around here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Inquisitors have a lot going on. Bad as things are here, they're worse elsewhere."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","There are always fires need putting out. Grendyl can't be everywhere."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","Doesn't change our job, does it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","We'll just have to hold the line then, won't we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","Could be. It's not like we've that much to go on."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Let's hope so. Faithless commanders don't win wars."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Faithful or not, you'd better follow Grendyl's orders."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","Just remember, the Emperor sees all, so you'd better do your part."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_four_b_01","What? You can understand all that gabble?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Hang about ... You actually know what all those words mean?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Who knew? Big Man's smarter than he looks."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_four_c_02","I might need you to translate for me, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_a_01","That Tech-Priest might be creepy, but she knows her way around a weapon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_a_02","That Tech-Priest gives me the shivers, but she can sure make a weapon sing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_a_03","Anyone else find that Tech-Priest creepy?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_a_04","It ain't just me, is it? The Tech-Priest's a bit ... unsettling?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_b_01","Ah, she's all right. Better than the Enginseer in my old regiment."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_b_02","I've known worse. Much worse. Some of these machine-heads go a bit ... funny."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_c_01","Long as she keeps my guns in order, we're all good."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Ah, there's worse than her waiting for us on Atoma."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I thought you weren't supposed to go poking around?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Oi! You keep out of my head! You hear me?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_three_c_01","I don't want any part of this conversation."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Fragging psykers ... No sense of boundaries ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Aye, likely enough. Bio-implants keep a body ticking long past its sell by, if you follow."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Could be the case. Mechanicus types don't often have much flesh left to get old."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_two_c_01","I know one thing: we'll be lucky to live so long ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hadron_two_c_02","Hey, if I make it to her age, I'll be happy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","You want to be careful, Big Man. It'll mean dirty work."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","I've seen the sorts she favours. Nasty lot, and that's by my standards."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Maybe stay put, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","You're better off here, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_01","I'm not crossing Commodore Hallowette. Not for all the aquilas on the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_02","That Hallowette's a tough one, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_03","There are deck plates on this ship more yielding than Commodore Hallowette."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_04","Don't care what you pay me, I'm not even looking funny at the Commodore."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The purser? Why, what have you heard?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Oho, I sense some purser-related gossip. Let's have it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","Saw her dressing Rannick down, I did. Too soft to make out details, but he was white as a corpse when they were done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","Only woman on this ship who puts a shiver into Rannick. That's enough for me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","I know what you mean. She drives a hard bargain."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Captive consumer base, ain't it? Where else are we gonna go?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Worst bit is she claims it all back if we die."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","Worse, as far as she's concerned we're just renting. We get offed, she gets it back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Oh, I don't know ... Hallowette's all right."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","She's a bit of an acquired taste, that's all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","Still, I wouldn't take my eye off her, if you follow?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","Even so, you wouldn't want to be alone with her in a dark corridor ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Nobles, that's who. Best steer clear of that sort, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Highborn families, Administratum officials, maybe even a deacon or two. Powerful people."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Way I see it, s'just like the guard. Top brass, officers, soldiers. All got a part to play."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","Lots of those families send their second-born children to join the Ministorum. Keeps the wheels greased."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_a_01","Problem with hive cities is all the fragging gangs."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_a_02","Every hive's the same. Fragging gangers stinking the place up."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_a_04","I know we have to stay on-mission, but by the Throne I'd like to take out some of the gangs..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Ninety billion souls in Hive Tertium alone. Gonna be a lot of bad elements among 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","I try not to judge ninety-billion hivers by the deeds of the few... But I really hate gangers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Official numbers put the criminal underworld at two percent of population. Could've fooled me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Scum of the earth... But I've seen 'em get trained up to be pretty good soldiers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","They always look good from the drop-ships. Works of art. Then you get inside and... yeesh."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Imagine living in the lower hive. All of em got scurvy, sump fever or rotskin. Maybe all three."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","All I know is, Hive Tertium is of value to the boss. That means we gotta clean out these fraggers, quick-sharp."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Nobody ever works their way up spireside. But they have no trouble falling down."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","The secret's the Moebian steel. Makes the best armour in the segmentum."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Strongest steel in the segmetum, with the know-how to forge with it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","Even if we save the metalfabs, they're nowt without workers to man them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","I notice we aren't putting as much effort into rescuing the labourers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Be a miracle if they ring the Bell of Lost Souls for us..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Don't reckon the likes of us start the Bell of Lost Souls tolling."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Sorry, Big Man. Reckon we won't be missed."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_four_c_02","Wouldn't mind getting mentioned in the same breath as Jarran Kell..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_a_01","Non-stop war... You think it's better back on Holy Terra?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_a_02","Wonder what things are like on Holy Terra? Must be better than this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_a_03","Imagine being on Holy Terra. What would that be like?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_a_04","If I could be anywhere else, reckon I'd pick Holy Terra."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Lines are so long, most pilgrims die before they even reach the Sol system."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_b_02","They say its just pilgrims as far as the eye can see."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_c_01","It'd sure be something to see the Golden Throne, wouldn't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Give my fragging right arm to see the Golden Throne, just once."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_three_b_01","If it weren't for the Grand Harvest, the Guard would have no soldiers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_three_b_02","Stow it, Witch. The Grand Harvest is what the keeps the Guard ticking."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_three_c_01","Pay the piper, or face the consequences. Nowt wrong with that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Can't let the Imperium grind to a halt. Tithe's gotta be paid."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_two_b_01","Imagine the power it takes to hold 'em all together."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Galaxy is a big place. Makes you think."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_two_c_01","Had guard duty on a Shrine World once. That was an eye-opener."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Put down a rebellion of a feral world once. More of a cull, really."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","Trust me, Big Man, you don't want the Officio Assassinorum showing up."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","If the Officio Assassinorum show up, you know it's gone to frag."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","It's the Callidus you have to watch out for. Could be anyone. Anywhere."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Callidus Assassins give me the creeps. They can look like anyone."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_01","If Grendyl sanctions Exterminatus here, how do you reckon it'll go down?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_02","If you could... y'know... Exterminatus this place... How would you do it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_03","Reckon we could Exterminatus this place? Logistically, I mean."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_04","Personally I'd Exterminatus this planet... if the logistics checked out."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","Redirect an asteroid. Point it at Atoma, and... boom."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Asteroids. Change their orbit, sit back and enjoy the show."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","I like to think we're the better option. Not the cheaper option."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Nice idea... Shame to blow up all these lovely tank factories."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","Somebody has to watch the enforcers. Guess that's us now."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Just don't abuse it, or Grendyl will have your guts for garters."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","It's a hierarchy, see. Enforcers; Adeptus Arbites; us."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","I take it you've all studied your Lex Imperialis?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","It's kinda satisfying, uncovering corruption in high places."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","There's never a lack of work, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","The Ordo was founded 'cos the others failed. I call that righteous."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","If this is the Emperor's plan for me, who am I to argue?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","Faith, Big Man. It works through faith."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","Reckon only the Emperor knows, and he ain't telling."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Heard it needs more power all the time. Ain't good news for psykers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","I'm telling you, don't mess with Age of Technology stuff."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_a_04","I think Solar Macharius was the greatest hero of the Imperium. Wish we knew more about him."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","Don't forget Sejanus and Drake - great heroes who fought at his side."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Patron Saint of the Imperial Guard. What a guy!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","It was the traitor, Richter, who done for him. Fragging coward."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","They say he never got over the betrayal of his lieutenant, Richter. Tragic."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Wasn't there an Age of Strife? Doesn't sound very illuminating."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","What, like the Age of Strife, when the xenos almost wiped us out?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Standard Template Constructs - they're the only things worth salvaging."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","It's always fun when they unearth a new tank design... I mean an old tank design."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","That was Goge Vandire's Reign of Blood, yeah? A miracle the Adeptus Ministorum survived."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","I've heard the legend, sure. The ""Reign of Blood"", they called it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Course, it were the Space Marines that brought Vandire down in the end."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Sebastian Thor on one side, the Space Marines on the other... Vandire didn't stand a chance!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_four_b_01","So am I, thank you very much."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_four_b_02","And we can't have too many of those."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_four_c_01","We keep to the straight and narrow, who knows. That could be us one day."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_four_c_02","Wonder what it's like, having an Inquisitor's ear?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_a_01","That Melk's a fussy little fragger, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_a_02","I've known some stuffed shirts in my time, but Melk's something special."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_a_03","I've had it up to here with Melk. Supercilious little bean counter."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_a_04","Throne, that Melk! Somewhere, a servitor array is missing part of its choir."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_b_01","What, you mean Sir Darius Melk the Fourteenth, Lord of the Quartervast?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_b_02","Surely you're not talking of the most humble Sir Darius Melk, thrice decorated for bravery by Lord Dolmar Martialis?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_c_01","Oh yes, very funny. Ha fragging ha."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_one_c_02","Everyone's a comedian ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_three_b_01","He's ex-Administratum, ain't he? That lot are always on the fiddle."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_three_b_02","Typical bureaucrat. Most of them have bloodier hands than me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_three_c_01","We're a right bunch, aren't we? Throne, but Atoma's in trouble ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_three_c_02","Morrow had it right. No-hopers, top to bottom."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_two_b_01","Come again? Barely understood a word of that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_two_b_02","You what? Speak slower and clearer, would you?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_two_c_01","I can give you elocu-- elac-- speaking lessons, if you'd like?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_melk_two_c_02","Fancy talk gets folk killed in battle. You do know that?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_four_b_01","No way! Grendyl wouldn't let him live, never mind have him on board the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Steady on, Big Man. I ate not long ago."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Still, might explain the sarge's rigid manner, if you know what I mean?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_four_c_02","To be honest, telling a good NCO and a robot apart's a tricky business."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_a_01","Scuttlebutt says that Morrow was part of the clean up after the Badab War."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_a_02","I was hearing this ain't Morrow's first gig thwarting Chaos. He was at the Badab War."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_a_03","Morrow's been at this awhile, so I heard. Fought at Badab, decades ago."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_a_04","Morrow gets around. Fought in the Badab War ... at least, that's what I heard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_b_01","I heard that too. Makes you think."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Well, well, well. Can't say I'm not prepared to believe it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Might be true. Life in the Guard can take you anywhere. I mean, look at me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Ain't healthy to be gossiping about folk who can have you up on charges ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Not really. A good NCO gets around."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_three_b_02","So he's travelled. Nothing odd about that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_three_c_01","Question is, who's telling the stories? Morrow, Rannick, or someone else?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_three_c_02","You reckon Morrow's making it all up himself? Might be the case."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Give over ... He'd be much too old."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_two_b_02","He'd have been dust long ago - even if the 'Nids didn't eat him."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_two_c_01","I don't know ... stranger things have happened."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Look, truth gets strange sometimes, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Ah, she's tiny by most standards. You should see the really big ones."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Oh, they get much larger than this. You should see the grand dames moored at Bakka."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","I hear she saw plenty of action out on the Rim not so long ago. Must be a tough lady."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","You've got to be hardy when a Rogue Trader's at your helm. It's a dangerous life."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Because he's in command, Big Man. Never see his sort at the front."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Someone has to hold things together. That's him."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Trust me, we're better off with the officer class out of the way."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_four_c_02","An officer's place is at the back, ours is at the front. You don't knock what works."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_a_01","Rannick's a cold fish, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_a_02","I never quite know what Rannick's thinking."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_a_03","Rannick's not exactly one to let his thoughts show, is he?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_a_04","I always shiver when Rannick takes a gander in my direction."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Ah, he's all right. Trust me, we could do worse."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_b_02","To him, we're criminals. Gotta prove ourselves, ain't we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Ah, high-ups are all the same. Live in a different world, they do."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_one_c_02","Best not to worry about it. He has his job, we've got ours."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_three_b_01","Probably Grendyl's grooming him. That's why he's running this op with so little oversight."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Certainly has a lot of latitude. Grendyl's practically leaving the whole show to him."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_three_c_01","I'm just glad he's dedicated. Atoma needs someone like that at the sharp end."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_three_c_02","We could do worse for an officer, trust me on that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Well, that ain't good. Someone with his authority should be as devout as they come."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Knew it as soon as he opened his mouth. More eager for explanations than for prayer."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_two_c_01","He'll learn. We're gonna need the Emperor's Light to get through this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_rannick_two_c_02","It's too much time spent looking at requisitions and intel reports, I reckon. Drains the spirit, all that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_a_01","The Imperium'd fall apart without servitors."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_a_02","Can't imagine an Imperium without servitors."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_a_03","Servitors get everywhere. They're the backbone of the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_a_04","Do you not find servitors reassuring? They're part of what makes the Imperium what it is."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_b_01","It's a selfless existence, blessed by the Emperor himself."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_b_02","I find 'em inspiring. They're part of what makes the Imperium what it is."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_c_01","It's just another form of service. Can't all be heroes, can we?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_servitors_one_c_02","Not my kind of service, I admit. I'm happier with a rifle and bayonet."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Guess they take after the Emperor."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","Emperor made 'em that way."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Heard their wounds heal in seconds. Imagine that!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","You could rip their arm off and they'd keep fighting. Impressive..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_01","Never any Space Marines around when you need them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_02","Pity the Space Marines aren't getting involved."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_03","What I wouldn't give for a few Space Marines right now..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_04","How bad's it have to get before the Space Marines get involved?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Saw the Imperial Fists in action once. Nowt left standing when they'd finished."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","Gotta be real bad before the Adeptus Astartes sully their hands."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","If they come, I hope they send the Ultramarines."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","It's the boys in blue I'd like to see. Send in the Ultramarines!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","Never thought I'd live to see such days."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","Said he'd return in our darkest hour. Guess this is it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Look, he's Lord Commander of the Imperium. The roster don't lie."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Wonder what this means for the Ultramarines?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","Even the Guard learned a thing or two from that book."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","The battle tactics are sound... If you're a hulking great Space Marine."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Without the Codex, things would be pretty bleak. Well... more bleak."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Guilliman is the greatest hero of the Imperium, and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","Reckon he's incorruptible... Sits in a stasis field, like Guilliman."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","Probably preserved as he was in life. Incorruptible."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Heard the Golden Throne is so tall, those at the bottom can't even see Him."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","The Emperor protects - that's all we need to know."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_01","Do you think the Emperor can... you know... talk?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_02","Reckon the Emperor ever talks to his attendants?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_03","Imagine what it must be like to hear the Emperor's voice..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_04","Has anyone living ever heard the Emperor speak, you think?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","Ain't spoken for ten thousand years... Give or take."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","Couldn't even imagine hearing the Emperor's voice..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","I guess the High Lords of Terra must understand him."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","Well, he must command the High Lords of Terra somehow."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Can't have unsanctioned witches running about. Might as well put 'em to use."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","It's a noble sacrifice. Them psykers are too dangerous to go free."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","I confess, if I was a psyker I'd fear the Black Ships catching up with me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","It's a harsh reality, but still... Nasty way to fragging go."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","I hear you, Priest. It's no kind of life for one so great."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","He made the Golden Throne himself, right? He knew it was coming..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","Legends say he was struck down by his own son... Must've stung."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","He's endured for ten thousand years... He'll never fail."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Well, it sort of folds into the Immaterium and... um... Does anyone else wanna take this?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Imagine you fold a bit of paper in half. That's space, yeah? Stick a knife through it and... Ah, never mind."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Truth is, without the Navigators we wouldn't get very far."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Put it this way, there's a reason the Navis Nobilite are the wealthiest families in the galaxy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_01","All these years, and I still get nervous about Warp travel..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_02","I love the Guard. Except for the Warp jumps. Not so keen on them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_03","Warp travel messes with my head... Not to mention my insides."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_04","Never get used to Warp travel, no matter how many jumps I make."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","I've heard stories of whole regiments going missing in the Warp."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","Remember that time the Valhallan 101st popped out of the Warp a hundred years late? Throne alive..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","Sticking to the Mandeville Points is the secret to safe travel. Mostly."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","Always prefer to spend extra time getting to a Mandeville Point. Safer that way."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Yeah, the time difference between realspace and Warp space can be rough."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","That's why we take the slow lane out to a Mandeville point. Cuts down on the craziness."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","Could be worse. Could run into a Warp storm."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","Deployed on a ship that got delayed once. Missed the battle. But least we got there..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","""Warp entities"", the top brass call 'em. We've all seen them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","You mean Warp entities? Best just ignore them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","One thing I've learned about Warp travel: Don't ever look out the viewports."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","Swear I saw an Enslaver once. So many tentacles..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Not me. Then again, I don't think she likes me back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","You've got funny tastes, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","Galaxy's gone mad, it has. And us with it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","Throne! I suppose there's no accounting for taste."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_01","That Psykhanium mistress ... Sefoni ... gives me the creeps."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_02","I don't much like that Sefoni ... even before she starts poking around my brain."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_03","That Sefoni? Creeps me out something proper."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_04","I should stop by the Psykhanium, get some training in. But Sefoni? She's a sinister one."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","I know what you mean. I don't trust her."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Yeah. She's unsettling, even for a psyker."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","No good comes of complaining. Best just to knuckle down and get on."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Orders is orders. You don't have to like working with the freak."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","The Psykhanium keeper? She's a cold one."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Yeah, I saw you were friendly. Two Freaks together."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Creepy is what she is."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","She gives me the heebie-jeebies."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","I've had worse drill sergeants ... I'll tell you that for nowt."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","Training's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's kinda the point."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Can't say I like her, but she does a good job."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","She's keeping you alive. Be thankful."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Valkyries are made for speed, not your coddled bones."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","I suppose you'd like to be wrapped up in teddle-wool next time?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Any landing you can walk away from, and all that ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","I'm not sure you're cut out for this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_war_end_b_01","If the Emperor's with us, yes."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_war_end_b_02","Long as we stay true to the Throne, we'll win through."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_war_end_c_01","Don't much matter. We've got our orders."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_war_end_c_02","You just keep fighting, you hear me?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Dunno, Big Man. Maybe you're thinking of a K'nib?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_four_b_02","News to me. Sounds nasty though."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_four_c_01","Hold on... There was the Lacrymole, wasn't there? Pretty sure they're extinct though."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_four_c_02","Dunno about infecting, but there are Mimics, aren't there? They sort of... mimic people."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_a_01","Wouldn't mind another go at the xenos. Nice break from all this heresy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_a_02","Since I signed up for Hereticus detail, I sure do miss fighting xenos."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_a_03","Remember when xenos were the worst thing we had to fight? Almost miss it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_a_04","Bet most of you lot never fought against xenos. Some weird stuff out there, I can tell you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_b_01","You know where you are with a scum-sucking traitor. Xenos are just so... alien."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Give me a lasgun and a fragging alien to shoot at, and I’ll die happy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_c_01","Clearly you've never seen anyone eaten by a Krootox."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_one_c_02","Feel like we've got a fighting chance against these heretics. Against a T'au gunline? Not so much."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_three_b_01","I don't think the Ordo Xenos are beyond dabbling, but I wouldn't try it myself."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_three_b_02","You're talking like one of the Ordo Xenos. We don't mess with that alien rubbish here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_three_c_01","You know about Blackstone Fortresses, right? They weren't built by us, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_three_c_02","Wouldn't mind getting my hands on a Hrud fusil rifle though. A soldier can dream..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_two_b_01","I wouldn't underestimate them. Their psykers are dangerous. Very dangerous."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_two_b_02","Ever seen 'em fight? Might as well try to catch starlight as fight Aeldari up close."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_two_c_01","Something about the way they fight; it's like a dance. Like killing for them is an art form."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_xenos_two_c_02","Reckon they know more about Chaos than we ever will, and that fragging worries me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_four_b_01","I'm not planning on crossing her, I can tell you that much."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_four_b_02","Won't find me giving her any chat-back."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_four_c_01","Just as well. Atoma's no place for the weak."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_four_c_02","Gotta be strong in a warzone like this, else you're dead meat."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_a_01","The explicator's not bad, deep down."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_a_02","The explicator acts hard, but I reckon her heart's in the right place."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_a_03","Don't be fooled by Zola's manner. She's one of the good ones."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_a_04","I reckon we can trust Zola ... even if she ain't part of the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_b_01","She's a bit focused, maybe, but that's probably a good thing, considering."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_b_02","She's not so bad. We could do a lot worse."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_c_01","She's done all right by me. I'll gladly follow her into battle."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_one_c_02","Doesn't matter much. She's in charge, so we follow. Simple as."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_three_b_01","The best COs are always like that. Don't knock it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_three_b_02","I've known plenty like her. They make for good soldiers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_three_c_01","She knows what she wants, and how to get it. That's good enough for me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_three_c_02","I've followed worse, and I reckon I will again."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_two_b_01","Oi, I'll have you know I'm as devout as they come. Always have been."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_two_b_02","Don't take that tone. The Emperor's Light is what keeps me going."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_two_c_01","Don't know about anyone else, but I find Zola's faith inspiring."
"loc_veteran_female_a__lore_zola_two_c_02","Won't get far without the Emperor at your side, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_female_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Got one! Need an escort!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Got one of the fraggers! Give me some cover!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_alarm_01","Someone kill that fragging alarm!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_alarm_02","We need to shut off that alarm!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","I guess we're not going in through the front door?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","Main entrance is locked up tight. No fragging way in."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","It's an impressive place, I'll give it that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","How does anyone keep track of what's kept in here?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","This data then ... where do you reckon it'll end up pointing?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Where do you think this proof will lead? ... If we get it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","All looks pretty automated are here, doesn't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Lot of automation in this place. Not many human beings even at the best of times."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","Looks like we're getting wet feet again ... "
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Oh look, another sewer. Lovely. Just fragging lovely."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Wouldn't it be easier if we just drove the train out of here?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Still don't see why we don't just drive the train out from under their noses ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Well, when you put it like that ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","It was just a thought. No need to be like that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","How'd you end up working for Grendyl anyway, Tech Priest?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You another criminal, Tech Priest? How did you end up here?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Somehow, I knew you were gonna say that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Definitely a reply ... Not so sure about it being an answer."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I hope our reinforcements are on their way."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","So, these fragging reinforcements of ours coming, or what?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Well, we're committed now. Better get it done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Shame to have come all this way for nothing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Busy place, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","This place never stops working, does it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Don't suppose anyone thought to bring a fragging map?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","Anyone bring a fragging map? Anyone even look at one?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Would you look at that? Something nasty came through here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Looks like something big came through here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Sentry duty, is it? Never thought I'd miss those days."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","Never did enjoy sentry duty myself. Safer than where we're going, mind."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Do you reckon there's any chance the Water Cartel can come back from this?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Water Cartel's seen better days, that's for sure. You reckon they're done for?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Well, I shan't lose any sleep over a bunch of gangers, I can tell you that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","They won't be missed. Then again, who is?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I'm surprised the heretics took over the Water Cartel so fast."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","I can't believe how quickly the heretics took over this place."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","The wages of sin, eh? Mind you, the wages of virtue don't seem much better."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Had it coming, didn't they? Couldn't happen to a more deserving bunch."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","So, explicator. How'd you end up joining the inquisition anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Been with Inquisitor Grendyl a while, haven't you explicator?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Fair enough. Not our business anyway, most likely."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Have it your way. But it can't hurt to know more about the folks you're fighting for."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_insignia_01","""Cartel""'s just a fancy name for scum, if you ask me. They ain't proper soldiers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Look at that. The Water Cartel fancied themselves as soldiers. Fat chance."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","Not much of a living, is it? Sifting rubbish from muck?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","Can't imagine having to subsist on what others throw away."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","Look at that decay! If the water does that to rockcrete, I don't want to think about what it's doing to my skin."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","This place is falling apart good and proper. Give it a couple of centuries and there'll be nothing left."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Right. We're at the bazaar. Looks like they've been having a crack at one another again."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","Look at all this. Any chance they'll wipe themselves out if we leave them to it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_shanty_01","Not much of a life to be had down here, is there?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_shanty_02","Life ain't ever easy, but I'll warrant it's harder down here than in most places."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_water_course_01","Would you look at that? Hard to think that it's water, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cartel_water_course_02","Don't go swimming in that lot, comrades. Won't end well."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","All right! Elevator's inbound! Hold this position!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Elevator's coming! Dig in - let's show these heretics how to fragging fight!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Come on, spill. Why can't we broadcast this message from the Mourningstar?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","Still can't see why the Mourningstar can't send this message out."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","Well, ain't that just fragging perfect?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Heh. Knew it. I just fragging knew it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","Who's this transmission for, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","Briefing never said who this transmission was for."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Fair enough. Secrets are secrets."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","Worth an ask, I suppose."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","Do we know what's in this transmission at least?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","Any info on what's in the transmission?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Can't argue with that. Bad intel gets folk killed."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","All in a good cause then? Ain't always the case."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Another mission with spotty intel. Just my fragging luck."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Another day, another thankless fragging mission."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Reckon they'll get this place up and running again if we pull this off?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","So … Assuming we're not all blasted to smithereens, reckon they'll get this place working again?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Would it kill you to speak in a language we could all understand?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","You see … You said a lot of words, but I'm still not sure what you meant."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Even if we can save the manufactorum, I reckon the workers have had it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","What about the workers, then? Those poor bastards long since dead or gone?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","I'd rather be in the Guard. At least there you're allowed to fight what's killing you."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Throne! The poor sods 'd be better off joining the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Just how important is this place to the war effort, then?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","This place must be fragging important for all this fuss."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Just as well we're here to save the day then, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Looks like we get to be heroes today, then. Does it come with better pay?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_heat_01","Throne, but it's fragging hot out here!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_heat_02","Can't say I'm in love with this heat. Every mouthful tastes like ash, and all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Won't be sorry to get out of this sweatbox!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_leaving_02","I think I've forgotten what the cold feels like …"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Now that? … That's a long way down."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Mind the edge, comrades. You'll not bounce when you hit bottom."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Right. This looks like the Overseer's Office. Next stop: Coolant Control."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","So hot I think I'm gonna melt, but we're almost to Coolant Control."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Leman Russ armour plating? Workhorse of the Imperial Guard!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Armour plating? Design looks like a Leman Russ. Fragging love those things."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Is it me, or is it even hotter down here? How do they get any sleep?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Weren't kidding when they said it'd be even hotter down here …"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_deception_01","So we're pulling the wool over the heretics' eyes, are we? I like that idea."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_deception_02","Nothing wrong with a bit of espionage, is there? It's all fair game."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","Look at this place! Even now, it carries the majesty of the Throne."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Blessed Throne! Wish we could restore this place. Doesn't seem right like this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Been a while since the enforcers were hereabouts, I take it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Not been any enforcers around here for some time, have there?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Maybe we'll get it straightened out when the war's done?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Could be chance to put things right, once the heretics are settled."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You ever find yourself in one of these Blocks, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You grew up hereabouts, explicator. Ever find yourself a guest here?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Understood. We can't all choose the road we walk."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Fair enough. Not my business, really."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What kind of arch-heretic holes up in a jail?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Why's this heretic lurking in a jail anyway? Seems odd."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Look at that! How do you suppose it stays up?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","You're joking. How do those legs support all that weight?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","Try as I might, I'm never not awed by the scale of these things."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","All this... Engineering on such a scale. Puts me in my place."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","We get to see all the nice places. Watch where you're walking."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","Smells like something died in here. Then again, it probably did."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","Looks like we've hit a market. Shame it's out of hours."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","Stalls all look abandoned. Don't blame them."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Throne, but the whole hab's on the wonk."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","Not sure it should all be leaning like this..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_alive_01","We're doing it! Smelter's coming alive!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_alive_02","Air's getting thicker! Smelter must be warming up!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I've been hearing that Atoma's Leman Russes are special. Any truth in that?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","What's so fragging special about Atoma's Leman Russes anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Tougher tanks, eh? Sounds good to me."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","So Atoman tanks are tougher than most? Can I have one? Might be handy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I'm not sure I know much about you, Tech Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","You're a bit mysterious, Tech Priest. Makes you hard to trust."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","You see? I've already got that nice warm glow of comradeship."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Wasn't what I was looking for, but it's start."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Strange that the heretics don't simply level this fragging place."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","If I were a heretic - don't get excited, I'm not - I'd just flatten this place. That'd stop it working."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Not sure I like the idea of that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","That sounds bad. I hope Rannick has a plan to stop it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Right, let's find this fragging smelter."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","The smelter can't be far."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Heat's building up. Let's get out of this hel-hole!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_hellhole_02","The air's sweltering already. Time to leave."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Sad to see it all so dark, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_lifeless_02","This place is meant to be alive. Strange that it ain't."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","I have eyes on the main entrance!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","Main entrance, dead ahead!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Nothing like an uplifting slogan or two to keep you working."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_propaganda_02","Must be a great sense of purpose working hereabouts."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Hold your ground! We need to wait for the elevator!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Stand your ground! Let's settle them, Guard-style!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","Gah! Get a lungful of that! Hot metal and charring."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","I hate foundry air. Crawls right down your throat and doesn't let go."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Lots of metalfabs on Atoma. Wonder what makes this one so important?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Heretics really want their claws on this place, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_hack_01","Don't trust these techie missions. Don't know one end of a data-interrogator from another."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_hack_02","Why send me on a techie mission? I'm no good with a data-interrogator."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_hack_03","I don't know one end of a data-interrogator from another."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","Cosy digs. I guess. If you're a heretic."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","Look at those shacks. How do they survive out here?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Is it me, or does this place look a little... infested?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Slime everywhere. There something you want to tell us?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Must've slipped everyone's minds. Yeah."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Oh, great. That's just great."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","How did this daemon get here, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","A daemon doesn't just pop out of nowhere. There has to be a reason."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","The heretics brought it? Guess they'll have to die. Not that I planned different."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Emperor preserve us..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","So... There's a daemon infesting this place?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The building's infested, but it's just this one, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Wish I hadn't asked now."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Just once, I'd like it to be good news."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Don't think we're going anywhere in that elevator..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","You know, I think I'll take the stairs..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A vox broadcast that turns you to Chaos? Bit far-fetched, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","It'll take more than a vox broadcast to turn me from the Emperor's Light."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","How high up are we now anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Feel's like we're a long way up the spire. How far's ground level?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","We sure there's no quicker way to the Comms-Plex?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Seems like we're taking the wrong way around."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Up top again? I don't like it. The air's too thin."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","Anyone else noticed how the air's different up here?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Would you look at that? Strange sort of beautiful, but I like it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Not a view we get to see that often. Not sure about all that sunshine, mind."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","It's a fragging trap!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","It's a trap!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","Doors are locked. We're trapped!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","They've suckered us!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","No vox signal. That's not good."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Can't get a vox signal!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Mourningstar? Come in, Mourningstar!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar? ... Can't raise them!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Back to back. Fight it out!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","Weapons up! Give them hel!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","We fight to the last. Got it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","We go down fighting. That's how the Guard do it!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_district_gate_01","Looks like the Scabs have sealed off access to the next district. Good strategy."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_district_gate_02","District Gate's sealed. Keeps things compartmentalised. Easier to control."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","So, what does this Logistratum do, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","I'm still not clear what this Logistratum's for."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","We'd better take it back sharpish, then."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Won't be easy, assaulting this place head-on."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Seems you know your way around this place, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Another of your old haunts, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Well, you're doing the Emperor's will now."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Not everyone hits the straight and narrow first time out."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","How come we never get to see any of this special issue ammo?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Can't say I've seen any special issue ammo back in the armoury."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Typical. Nothing says 'thank you' like nothing."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Doesn't seem fair, that. But whatever."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","Take it from me - never trust a hab block that's locked down like that."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","That hab block looks quiet. Never a good sign."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","So we're not exactly knocking on the front door?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Look at us, scratching between the walls like rats."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_trains_01","Trains are still running ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_rails_trains_02","The heretics have the trains running overtime, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Definitely a step up from what we're used to."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","Streets are quiet. No surprise. Wonder if anyone's still alive behind those doors?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","What's taking the fragging bridge so long?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","You take your time, bridge. I've got all night. Honest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","Bridge of Martyrs? What could go wrong?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","Cheery name. I don't think."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","Just our fragging luck."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","Maybe we can just jump across? ... Nah, forget it."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","Fraggers don't want to let it go, do they?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","Gonna get company. Be ready!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","The Emperor's with us! That's all that matters."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","They ain't got the training. And we do! ... Well, I do."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","Looks like a preacher's pulpit. Strange to see it empty."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","Even the fragging preachers don't fancy the odds. Not a good sign."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","Let's give the old fool a bit of payback, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","Picking on harmless old ranters. Oi! Pick a fight with us!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Bit of a change of pace from the nasty old downside, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Bit nicer hereabouts, don't you reckon?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_retrieve_01","Looks like it's fetch and carry time. Just like being back in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_retrieve_02","Dragging stuff around under fire? Just a day like any other. Ain't that right, comrades?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scan_01","Scanning mission? Not my thing. I'm a grunt. Hold the line, take that position ... die in the mud."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scan_02","I hate scanning missions. Tech work. Give me a trenchline and artillery support, that's the life."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","I'd say it's nice to be closer to the surface, but I wouldn't want to be thought a liar."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Makes a change from the bowels of Downside, doesn't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","How long's this fragging place been abandoned, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Throne, but this place is a mess. How long since it was abandoned?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Doesn't mean it ain't worth fighting for. Point me in the right direction, I'll get the job done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Still part of the Imperium though, ain't it. Can't leave it in the hands of those heretic scum."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","What's with the heretics brewing these plagues then? Ain't there enough nastiness in the galaxy?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The heretics are creating contagions out here, are they? Guess it takes all fragging sorts."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Oh, ain't that lovely? This job gets better and better."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Should've stayed in the Guard, that's what I should have done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Something of a transport hub, was it? Back in the day?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","So this was a trading zone, or so I heard. Out-world and in."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Don't think there's much of value around here now. Nor much that can still fly."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Hard times find all of us, sooner or later. Sorry … don't know why I'm so cheery."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_interior_01","Look at the state of this place - one too many hive quakes, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_interior_02","This place has taken a fragging battering, hasn't it? Hive quakes, most likely."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","Throne! Look at this fragging lot. It's a wonder any of them still work."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","Got to admit, there's a bit of grandeur about this place, even in this kind of nick."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Cargo elevator is down. Looks like we're clear to proceed."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","Cargo elevator's in position. Something went our fragging way for a change."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","This place is a fragging maze!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","I hope this place made more sense before bits started dropping off!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_approach_01","I have eyes on Chasm Terminus. It's hard to miss."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_approach_02","Chasm Terminus's in sight. You can bet it'll be a fight to reach the platform."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Right. Stay fragging tight down there and watch each others' backs, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","We work as a team, you hear me? No grandstanding and no running off!"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","We'll not let you down."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Don't worry, we've got this."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What are we fragging dealing with down there anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Oi! Control! You mind telling us what we're up against?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Understood. We'll get it done."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Fragging great. Time to be miracle workers."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","I had a mate end up in a place like this. Didn't come back out again."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","Looks like a magistratum catechizer post. Not somewhere you want to end up."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Atoma's going to hel, and we're making sure the trains run on time. Funny, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","So ... We can redirect a train, simple as that, but ammo's always scarce?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","I wasn't complaining. Not that it'd matter if I was, would it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Easy. Easy. Weren't looking for a fight. Just ... thinking aloud."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","I'm not so sure about all this commando stuff. I was born to fight on the front lines."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","All this sneaking about ... I prefer a straight fight, if I'm honest."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","Don't you worry, I'll get it done. Just saying, was all."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Yeah. Not many second prizes on the battlefield, if you follow?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","Couldn't we have run the splice from Chasm Terminus? Might have been quicker."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Never thought I'd be redirecting trains from a marketplace."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","I suppose that makes sense. Insofar as owt does around here."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","When you put it like that, I guess it does make sense."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","This lot look like they're here to stay ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","These soldiers look like they're in it for the long haul ..."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_station_hall_01","Places like this always make me feel tiny."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_station_hall_02","Look at all that! Takes your breath away, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Looks like there's another assault underway to the south."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_station_the_bridge_02","See that fire-fight off to the south? Let's hope our lot hold."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","Room enough in this place for an army. Let's hope they're elsewhere."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Wouldn't catch real soldiers living in a slum like this. No standards, this lot."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Bad news, ain't it, if there's a daemon crawling around Tertium?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Can't be good, having a daemon so deep in the hive."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Yeah. Sounds wonderful."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","The Emperor's with us. We need not fear the daemon."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Any chance we'll take this place back from the heretics?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Give the word, we'll come down here and throw the heretics out."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Well, you let me know if that changes."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Understood. Orders is orders."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I don't get it. How can a place this lawless thrive? Doesn't the law mean owt?"
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","This place is a warren of thugs and chancers. Doesn't seem right."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Fair enough."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","I can't say I understand, but I suppose I don't have to."
"loc_veteran_female_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","I prefer the traditional kind of statues myself. Something in bronze, or worked stone."

"loc_veteran_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_10","Revolting. Glad I don't have to clean it up."

"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedicated_beloved_c_01","You know, the one where you talk to your Beloved all the time. Hoping we go easy on you because not all your bullets are loaded."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedicated_beloved_e_01","Gotta hand it to you, you're dedicated. "
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_destiny_b_01","Oh did you now? Maybe you should have asked before committing to something like that? And besides, who put you in charge?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_destiny_d_01","That's what makes a good leader, right enough: delusional citing of abstract concepts."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_disappear_b_01","Oh really? Heretics got him?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_disappear_d_01","And why did he do that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_disappear_f_01","Well I think your Beloved is wonderful."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eyeballs_a_01","You really give me the creeps, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eyeballs_c_01","I guess it's one of those ""eye of the beholder"" things."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friendly_fire_b_01","Yeah? Well, that's soldiering, ain't it? Always more folks who need a bullet in the back: officers, commissars ... people who don't share the ammo and meds."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friendly_fire_d_01","One way to find out, ain't there?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_homesick_a_01","Anyway, back when you were in the Guard--"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_homesick_c_01","Oooo ... Touchy, ain't we? Could it be you're homesick?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_immortal_b_01","Me? No. Pretty sure I can't die."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_immortal_d_01","Born lucky, that's me. And besides, I'm still here ain't I, even with all those heretics shooting at us? Ergo, I can't die. Empiricism at work."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_immortal_f_01","Glad to hear it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_in_the_moment_a_01","How are you doing over there? Still hearing imaginary voices?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_in_the_moment_c_01","Doubts? I don't have doubts. Doubts are for folk who don't live in the moment. "
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_inside_out_b_01","You don't want to be looked at strangely, don't be strange. It ain't complicated."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_inside_out_d_01","Yeah ... Go with your instincts on that one, I would."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_little_things_a_01","Are you gonna keep up with the rest of us, or what?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_little_things_c_01","You spend too long looking at the view, you'll be gone."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mallard_b_01","You can't fix this. I mean ... look at the life we're leading."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mallard_d_01","That's a hard ""no"" on both of those, thanks."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_no_thinking_b_01","Really? I get tired just thinking about doing things."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_no_thinking_d_01","Right you are ... The rest of you heard that, right? No more thinking for me - the Emperor said so."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_optimism_b_01","You always have a bad feeling. I'm thinking it's probably your diet ... or something wrong with your spine."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_optimism_d_01","Not me. I'm all sunbeams and flowers and optimism. Ask anyone."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_philosophy_b_01","You all right over there?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_philosophy_d_01","Do I want to know what it's about?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_point_of_view_a_01","So ... This Beloved of yours ... Does he ever mention me?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_point_of_view_c_01","That doesn't sound good. "
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_point_of_view_e_01","And if you had my point of view?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sides_a_01","You just remember what side you're on, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sides_c_01","Is that so? What about the rest of us?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_small_brain_b_01","That depends. Are you going to do something horrible to my brain?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soothing_blood_a_01","You know, I've the strangest feeling that we've all done all of this before."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soothing_blood_c_01","I reckon it'd help if you wiped all that blood out of your eyes."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soothing_blood_e_01","Riiiight."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tancred_b_01","Me? I'm thinking I should have stayed aboard the Tancred Bastion and taken my chances."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tancred_d_01","Everyone always is. Perpetual slacker, that's me, and proud of it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trusted_a_01","So, back when you were in the Guard--"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trusted_c_01","Secondment from prison."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trusted_e_01","Riiiight."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_very_hurt_b_01","If you ask me, we're all about five minutes away from never waking up ever again."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_very_hurt_d_01","Hear that? Even your imaginary friend's had enough of you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wax_a_01","Still breathing, are you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wax_c_01","Not much hope of that around here. Dense living and slaughter ain't an aroma to give up lightly."

"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_hound_b_01","I wouldn't hold your breath. That other Ogryn would only eat it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_hound_b_02","Why not? Has to be smarter than some of you lot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_01","Oh, lighten up. If it's hard for us, it's hard for the heretics. Probably."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_02","Complaining again, Big Man? Now there's a surprise."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_01","Oh yeah, I'll get right on it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_02","I don't know. Might be they just want to be friendly."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_01","Simple rule: if you hear screaming, shoot at it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_02","Nothing that a bit of panic fire can't cope with. It's not like they're charging us for the ammo."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_01","Oh, give over. It's a real meeting of minds in your case."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_02","Just because they're faster than you. Smarter too, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_a_01","Gonna be close fighting in this muck."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_a_02","Can't see karking thing! We're gonna have to get stuck in."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_01","You're telling me. Fog's thicker than a Ratling think-tank in here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_02","You're not wrong. Spooky, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_a_01","I'm not much of one for running away, so let's just shoot any Hounds in the face."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_a_02","I'm not running from anything, much less a Hound. Let's just shoot 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_01","I'll be sure to remember that when one's drooling on my face."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_02","Not much comfort when they're gnawing on your bones."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_01","Ain't no guarantees in this life but death, damnation and Sergeant Major Morrow."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_02","Lighten up. We're all dying anyhow. Only the vector changes."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_02_b_01","Just stand well back when you do it, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_05_b_01","Everyone should have an Ogryn for a bodyguard."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_10_b_01","No chance, worse luck."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_11_b_01","Long as you don't ending up fighting ""against"" friends, we're golden."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_18_b_01","They're just plain crazy full stop."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_20_b_01","Yes, killing for everybody!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_06_b_01","Tell us something we don't know?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_07_b_01","You got that right. Don't step forward, and always take a big step back, just in case."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_09_b_01","Everything makes you mad."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_13_b_01","Sure. Next skirmish is all yours. I'll watch."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_14_b_01","Is that why you don't listen?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_06_b_01","Guess we aren't worthy of respirators."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_07_b_01","You finally found something you couldn't eat?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_09_b_01","Maybe think a bit less. We don't want your head to pop."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_13_b_01","I didn't know you could count."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_14_b_01","Is that bone from...? Never mind. Don't want to know."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_01_b_01","What? Are you not enjoying yourself?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_04_b_01","I don't know ... running away's got a certain appeal right now."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_b_01","Wars don't, by and large. Best you can do is still be standing at the end."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_b_01","Be careful what you wish for ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_16_b_01","Don't breathe too deep. There's something nasty in the air."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_17_b_01","Hah! It'll do you good!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_01_b_01","Fair. There's not much to like about any of this."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_04_b_01","Hear that? We've got a clock-watcher on our hands."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_b_01","Tell him I agree, if you think that'll help."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_12_b_01","There's no need to go making personal comments."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_16_b_01","If it makes you feel better, they're probably saying the same about us."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_17_b_01","Erm ... Not really sure how I should answer that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_b_01","Yeah. Nothing quite like the risk of death to make a soldier thankful."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_07_b_01","Trust me, duty gets tiresome."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_b_01","Then I guess I've only ever met bad ones..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_16_b_01","Oh, I dunno. Some of these karkers deserve a bit of suffering."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_17_b_01","A conscience? Luxury."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_06_b_01","Yeah, you keep dreaming."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_b_01","Yeah, yeah, yeah ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_b_01","You're not in the Guard. They locked you up, remember?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_b_01","Save your breath for fighting, why don't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_14_b_01","Oh ... Something to look forward to."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_01_a_01","Another glorious day in Grendyl's service, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_a_01","The worst of it is, this mission is light duty. You don't want to see the other kind."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","Too right. I want as close to an easy life as I can get."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_03_b_01","Not me. I plan on living forever."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_a_01","Can't think of anything I'd rather be doing. Oh, wait ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_06_a_01","Cheer up you lot! Could be worse!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_06_b_01","You had to go and say it aloud, didn't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_a_01","You dozy lot should be taking lessons from me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_b_01","Sounds like a fine way to end up dead."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_08_a_01","Seen one bunch of rotting traitors, you've seen them all."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_a_01","Are we done yet? I need a snooze."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_b_01","You and me both."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_10_a_01","You know, I passed up some perfectly good racketeering to be part of this."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_11_a_01","There's a heretic lurking under every rock, ain't there?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_12_a_01","You know what I like about all this? No Commissars poking their bony noses into my business."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_a_01","You lot are all right, d'you know that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_b_01","Cream of the crop, me. You're lucky to have me around."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_14_a_01","We're a funny looking bunch, but we get the job done."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_14_b_01","Don't we just?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_15_a_01","This place is a karking nightmare, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_16_a_01","If you get cut off, just keep karking fighting. Take some of them with you!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_17_a_01","This uniform itches. Just can't get it sitting right."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_18_a_01","Get in close next time! Make the karkers fear you!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_19_a_01","Next engagement, none of this fancy footwork. Just get stuck in!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_20_a_01","They've got the numbers, but we've got the skills, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_b_01","Don't go on so, you'll break my heart."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_03_b_01","Dibs on counting the ammo. You handle the rest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_07_b_01","Just another karking day in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_b_01","I don't know ... Sounds like a lot of hard work."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_b_01","Am I supposed the find that inspiring?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_14_b_01","Oi! I'm just warming up, that's all."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_01_b_01","Yeah. It's not pretty."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_03_b_01","Nope. Didn't understand a word of that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_04_b_01","You do as you like. I like to get paid. Or at least fed."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_07_b_01","You're right. The more I try to understand you, the more I have doubts."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_16_b_01","I seem to have left mine back on the ship."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_17_b_01","I don't know. Once seems like plenty."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_01_b_01","Works for me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_03_b_01","I'll give you that one, but don't go crowing about it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_04_b_01","That's exactly the way around I prefer it!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_07_b_01","Follow you? I'll take my chances on my own. See which of us the Emperor loves most, eh?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_16_b_01","... for Morrow and his lot surely won't."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_17_b_01","Well ... Let's hope, anyway."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_b_01","Creed's swagger, not again..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_b_01","Let's not give 'em the satisfaction."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_06_b_01","Wish he'd deliver us some reinforcements..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_11_b_01","I suppose dying peacefully in my sleep is too much to ask?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_15_b_01","Can you be with us a bit quieter?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_16_b_01","Not sure Atoma falling to heretics was part of his great plan."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Are we having fun yet?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_02","Gotta admit, this could be going worse!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_03","Beats sitting around in a jail cell, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Come out and play, heretics!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_05","I reckon they're scared of us!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_06","We're mighty karkers, ain't we?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_07","This could be going better, but it could be going worse."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_08","Eyes open - don't let those karkers get the drop on you!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_09","You see a heretic's smiling face, open fire!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_10","On we go. Into the karking fire, as usual."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","They're just jealous, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","Creed's swagger... they said it to your face?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","You take all the fun out of soldiering, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","This ain't the Guard. You can't have me up on a charge."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","You should try aiming. It'll help."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","At least you showed that wall what for. Proper dead, it is."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Hey, sticky-fingers! Share the ammo!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Stop hogging all the karking ammo!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Give over stealing all the ammo!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","I saw it first!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Finders, keepers!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","That right? How would I tell?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","So what's karking new?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","There's always trouble ahead. That's how this works."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","Plenty of trouble behind and all. Maybe we should just call it a day?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Suit yourself. I wouldn't let them near my grey matter."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","Ain't no one goes poking in my brain. And yes, I do have one."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Easy there, slugger. This ain't a karking game."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","They've just gotten squirrelly, that's all."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Oh, so that ain't your blood I see?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","You sure? You look awful beat up, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Well, that's us cursed. Thanks a bunch."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Had to say it, didn't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","That's what you're here for. Go get 'em!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","You got one job, Big Man: Smash."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","I'm starting to think you've ice in your veins, not blood."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","Cold? Give over."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","I always had you down as a karking cut throat."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","You're doing good. Not as good as me, of course."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Bunch of wannabe soldiers if you ask me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Play in filth, get mucky."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","It's what the Guard do best: Die fighting."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","Um... What's option B?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Ask them if they've any advice. We could karking use some."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Invisible friends is it now? Hah."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","They say he once killed an Ork Warboss with a headbutt..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","If all Ogryns were like him, we'd be out of a job."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","What? Having the Emperor in your corner not good enough?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","I'll get right on that, I will."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_a_01","So... If I were to scarper and take my chances, would anyone come with?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_a_02","This is a fool's game. Anyone want to split?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_a_03","We're dead meat if we keep working for Grendyl. Maybe we should desert?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","You do know that Morrow can hear everything you're saying?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","It's tempting, but I don't reckon we'd get far."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Oi, and what am I? Chopped liver?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","Don't know what you mean. I'll take 'em all on!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","Yes sir! No sir! Shine your boots sir?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","You're not in charge. You do know that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","Nothing like a kaboom to ruin someone's day."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","We can't all be walking bombs..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Optimistic as ever..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","It's only gonna get worse..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","Let me know if you stop bouncing off the sides of reality, won't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Do you really want an answer to that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Ach, I'm afraid my canteen's completely dry."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","I knew it! The Priest's a sozzle-wit!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","Are you sure? Can't say I've seen him hereabouts."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","Is that so? Maybe we can bunk off ... leave him to it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_a_01","You reckon this is the end of Atoma?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_a_02","Well, this planet's done for, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_a_03","Could be curtains for Atoma, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","Doesn't look good, and that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Looks like. Then again, the Guard have pulled places back from worse."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","This is nothing. You should see where I grew up."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Don't take it personal. Most folk are sheep, following the flock. Baaaa."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","I think I prefer it when you're quiet."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Cheery little karker, ain't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","You don't say? And I thought we were special."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","Oh? And Morrow otherwise seems so sentimental."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Really? I don't think I've heard you mention that before."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","And mine. I must be part Ogryn."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","Good for destroying evidence too, if you know what I mean."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Until someone hits the fuel tank, and then it's bad news for everyone nearby."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Better than me. I wasn't listening in the briefing."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Don't worry about it. I never do."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","Thanks for that. Cheered me right up, it did."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","But on the plus side, we could all die at any moment, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_a_01","Gotta admit, you lot are growing on me - and not like that fungus on the refectory pipes."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_a_02","I'm thinking we make a good team ... despite everything."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_a_03","We work well together ... I'm gonna miss you when an heretic puts your lights out."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","I was just thinking the same."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You're not bad yourself ... Most of the time."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Creed's swagger..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Nope. That's nasty."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","They're not so bad. Dumb little rotters."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","The way I see it, walking corpses are halfway where we want 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Will you stop snaffling all the medicae?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","I saw that! You didn't need the healing, so why use it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","Did that little scratch hurt? You wouldn't last a day in my old regiment."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Oh, look who's talking. I've seen how you've been carrying on."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","Oh, and you're such a model soldier, ain't ya? Karking bossyboots."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","Me too, Big Man. Then again, there is that outstanding warrant..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Ah. Home's wherever you can kip without fetching a slit throat."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","Are you trying to draw attention to us, Priest?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","Creed's swagger, not again…"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","All right, all right. Calm yourself."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","Right little firebrand, ain't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","Sssshh. Don't tempt fate."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","We're not done killing today, I've got a feeling ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Yeah. What can possibly go wrong?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","I agree. Cometh the hour, cometh the man, and all that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","Yet they've let their defences down..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Concentrate on the job, Witch."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","If I thump you, will that be real enough?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","I'm very real, thank you very much. At least, I think I am."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","Good to be happy in your work, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","Careful there, you've gone a tiny bit psychotic ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","Don't get distracted, we've a job to do."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Stay on mission, Witch."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","And if I don't comply, you'll melt me with your brain, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","Pretty sure I heard a threat in there. Anyone else?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","I dunno about that. We've still got walls, ceilings ... floors."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Don't be so karking gloomy. They can always rebuild."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","You shoot me plenty already with that little thing. Don't fancy a lascannon shot in the back."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Maybe learn to aim with the one you've got, first?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","Stairs? No way. Wait ... are you scared?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","I'm not walking if I can ride. Hang on ... are you scared?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","You worry about spiritual rewards. I just try to survive till the next payday."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","We'll worry about that later, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","Maybe we get through the day first, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","Why don't you go first, while I go do something more important."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Hello? You do know they're still out there?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Sure. That won't give our position away at all."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Magic, Big Man. Lots and lots of magic."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Speaking for myself, I'm labouring under a terrible, terrible curse."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Oh come on, they're not that bad."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","I like them. Tangy, they are."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Ah, don't worry about it. I'm an equal opportunity sociopath."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","Poking around my head? Let me know if you find out where I left my lucky rock."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Don't be like that. You're still plenty smarter than the Priests."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","We can't all be geniuses. Can't all be pretty, neither. Not like me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","Sure. And there'll be dancing and flowers and booze flowing free ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","Take a good look around. Are you sure about that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_a_01","You reckon we'll ever get a day off? You know, a bit of leave?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_a_02","So, do we get leave around here? Time off for good behaviour?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_a_03","Do we ever get a break from this meat grinder? I could use some R&R."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","I karking well hope so. Killing's nice, but I could use a change of pace."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","Cold ale, friendly locals, a proper bed? That does sound like a good idea."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_a_01","Anyone fancy a bit of a sing-song?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_a_02","I feel like singing? Anyone else?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_a_03","You know what? A bit of singing will keep the spirits up."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","You really think this is a good time?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Yeah. Sure. Let's give away our position."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Just what we needed: a narcoleptic Ogryn..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Stay awake, you big lump."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_a_01","I hate karking snipers! Come over here and fight fair, you know?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_a_02","Seen a lot of sharpshooters down here. Cowardly business."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_a_03","Keep your eyes open for snipers. They get everywhere."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Ain't right, killing from a distance ... unless I'm doing it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","I prefer to do my killing eye to eye, so long as I'm winning."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","All right, all right. Keep your hair on!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Simmer down, would you? I'm getting tired just watching you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Being stealthy takes longer, and I'm bored already."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","Nothing wrong with a straight-up fight. Makes things nice and clear. Dead clear."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","You think this is bad, you should try sleeping in a barrack block. Curl your toes, it would."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","Ah, the honest stink of a campaigning soldier. It's healthy."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Ooh! Ooh! Volunteering to be the turret gunner!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","Be nice to have some heavy ordnance, I can't lie."
"loc_veteran_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Yeah, real lovely warzone you got here."

"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","Watch yourself. The sergeant-major's in a foul mood again."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","Steer clear of the sarge. He's in one of his moods."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","He's all mouth. Trust me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","You need to toughen up. He's all talk."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","I bet he got all weepy about his time with Yarrick, didn't he?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Is there anything more pathetic than a bitter old hero?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_01","Turns out old Morrow was at Xanatros. Who knew?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_02","I dig some digging around - cost me a couple of bottles of the good stuff. Morrow was at Xanatros."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_03","I've been hearing that Morrow was at Xanatros. Not that he talks about it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_04","Morrow was at Xanatros. Tough old devil, and no mistake."

"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_03_02","Genestealers. Genestealers everywhere, and Morrow walks out alive."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_03_03","Lost three Mordian regiments there, didn't they? Something about genestealers?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_03_04","Xanatros ... That was Genestealers, wasn't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","Let me guess. Morrow was working for the Inquisitor there and all?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","And Morrow was the Inquisitor's man, just like here on Atoma?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_01","You can bet that's the case."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_02","What else would he be doing there?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_03","Yeah. Wonder what happened to the rest of his team?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_04","Reckon you can count on it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow's been around a while. I heard he was in the Second War for Armageddon."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow looks young enough, but he's old. He was at Hades Hive, and that's centuries ago."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","His ship got lost in the Warp, didn't it? Lots do."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","So his ship got caught up in a Warp storm? So what?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","You know what? I don't care."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Do I care? Let me think. No. No I don't."

"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","That Tech-Priest gives me the creeps."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","She keeps looking at me as if I'm a bundle of spare parts awaiting reassignment."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","She keeps giving me funny looks. Me!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","Thank the Throne we don't have to deal with her that much, eh?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Just don't tell her we've be talking about her, alright?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","Oh yeah, and it's going splendidly so far, it is."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","And what fun it is. Fair makes me tingle to my boots."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","And where was the God-Emperor when I was neck deep in my own platoon's blood? Tell me that!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","I'd sooner put my faith in a bayonet and rifle, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","That's an odd gabble you've got yourself."

"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","How about a few Sentinels? Make short work of this lot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_01","Back in the Guard we'd have had more backup, and a lot more guns."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_02","Few more guns wouldn't go amiss. Wonder what the old platoon is up to?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_03","Outgunned behind enemy lines. Times like this I miss the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_04","Never thought I'd miss the Guard, but here we are."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","It's all the rules and regulations I can do without."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","Nothing more stirring than a Rough Rider charge, I'll grant you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","Best thing about the Guard is that there's always someone else to blame."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","Too many officers for my liking. We've got it good here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Threat of a bolt pistol round to the back of the head is quite the motivator..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","Sadistic karkers, the lot of 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Black hearts to match their black coats. Can't trust 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Annoyingly good in a scrap though. I wouldn't test them."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","Happily they were all drowned out by the explosions."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","All they're good for is last rites."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Better a preacher than a commissar, I s'pose."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_four_b_01","Really? Reckon I signed on with the wrong crew."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_four_b_02","Nothing wrong with that. Shows initiative. Daring. A nose for plunder."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_four_c_01","You see, that sounds like a better life than the one I'm stuck in."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_four_c_02","Wouldn't mind being a pirate, if the opportunity arose."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_a_01","The shipmistress has a fine scowl, doesn't she?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_a_02","So, the shipmistress. Not exactly a sunbeam, is she?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_a_03","Have you seen Brahms yet. Looks like I feel when I'm hungover."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_a_04","Crossed paths with the shipmistress earlier. Nearly shrivelled me on the spot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_b_01","She loves this ship, and she's not happy Grendyl's got it in harm's way."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_b_02","Grendyl's got the Mourningstar in the thick of things, and she loves this ship."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_c_01","If I know one thing about life aboard ship, it's ""don't cross the skipper""."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_one_c_02","Mind how you speak to her. Don't want to find yourself floating home, do you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_three_b_01","She reminds me of my old colonel. He never had a ray of sunshine in him either."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_three_b_02","At least she's in charge of something. Not like us."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_three_c_01","High born folk always have angst. It's their way of pretending suffering."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_three_c_02","Well, however bad Brahms has it, we've got it worse."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_two_b_01","You're feeling brave today. Word always gets back to the skipper on ships like this."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_two_b_02","You should tell Brahms directly. And I should watch."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_two_c_01","What's wrong with trading with aliens, anyway? I mean, so long as they're not shooting at you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_brahms_two_c_02","It's not like trade does any harm. Treaties are always open to renegotiation, if your guns are big enough."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_four_c_01","Tough karkers though. Feel no pain."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_four_c_02","Decay makes 'em karking hard to kill."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_a_01","Based on the shrines, them things the heretics worship seem a lot like gods..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_a_02","So these ""Ruinous Powers""... Definitely not gods? We sure?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_a_03","Karking heretics think they're worshipping gods. Maybe they're right."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_a_04","Heretics think the Chaos powers are actual gods. Who's to say they're wrong..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_b_01","Never killed a god. Fancy a crack at it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_b_02","Karkers seem mad to me, but what do I know?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Some of 'em literally shout ""Blood for the Blood God"" while they run at you. Mad karkers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_one_c_02","Something must drive 'em to carve their own flesh and turn on their own."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_three_b_01","Makes sense I suppose. Daemons gotta live somewhere, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_three_b_02","So, when we make Warp jumps we're... visiting Daemon-land? You've gotta be kidding..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_three_c_01","Let's not start talking about dreams, right? Private, ain't they."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Fine. There's a Realm of Chaos. I call it Hel, and that's where I'm sending the heretics."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Seen 'em with my own eyes. Big karkers. Spikes and skulls - dead giveaway."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_two_b_02","Ain't no doubt they're out there. Better hope we don't meet one of the karkers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Heard of some acting as reavers. Small warbands that can strike anywhere... any time..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_chaos_two_c_02","If you ever see one of the karkers, call in heavy support, or run like hel."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_four_b_01","It's a big karking problem is what it is."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_four_b_02","The thing that's gonna destroy us all, if you believe some people."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_four_c_01","Wish there was a way to get some payback for Cadia."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Don't reckon they'll ever stop fighting over the Cadian Gate."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_one_a_01","Daemons are Warp-creatures. Won't see any down here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_one_a_02","Ha! Ain't afraid of no Daemons, least not in realspace."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_one_a_03","Least we shouldn't run into any Daemons outside of Warp space."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_one_a_04","Never seen a Daemon outside Warp space. We're safe here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Wouldn't be so sure..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_one_b_02","I dunno, I've heard some stories..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_one_c_01","Next you'll be saying that Grey Knights are real..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_three_b_01","Creed's swagger... You're not gonna get possessed are you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_three_b_02","You start acting all Daemonic, I'll put you down."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_three_c_01","This is why we don't tolerate rogue psykers, see!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_three_c_02","Nothing more dangerous than a rogue psyker."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_two_b_01","Still can't believe it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Daemons... on Terra. Unbelievable."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_two_c_01","If they'd reached the Eternity Gate, the game would've been up."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_daemons_two_c_02","Space Marines saved the day again, so I'm told."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","Careful, Big Man, that's a touchy subject."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","That's the question, ain't it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","Let's have some quiet time, shall we... Before we get executed."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","Probably best not to question it. You'll live longer."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_01","Should call in the Battle Sisters; that'd sort these heretics out."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_02","Need some Sisters of Battle to sort out these heretics."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_03","If things get much worse, we should call in the Sisters of Battle."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_04","What we need down here is the Sisters of Battle."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","Really? Why not get a Space Marine company in while you're at it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Chance'd be a fine thing."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","Might as well just declare Atoma Exterminatus. Result'd be the same."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Mind you, I've always wanted to see a Penitus Engine in action..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Seen enough Missionaries in the Guard. Funny in the head."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","Don't get me started on them lot..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","Judge, jury and executioner. Least they think they are."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","Surprisingly good xenos-fighters, I'll give em that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","Don't hold your breath, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","I'd rather just make it through the day, thanks."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","They sit outside Administratum control... Always seemed suspicious to me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Ain't no glory in death, no matter how you go."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","If it's got tentacles, or an extra head, just shoot it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","That's the problem, Big Man. Ain't always obvious."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","If in doubt, assume the worst."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","If they run, they're probably guilty of something. Easy."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","Better toughen up, Witch, and quick."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","This job's not for the faint-hearted."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","If they weren't guilty, they wouldn't confess."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Good to have a few on our side, just in case."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","How'd you tell the good kind from the bad kind?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","When a psyker goes ""pop"", just gotta hope they don't take you with 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","Yeah, let's hope we don't meet any of the karkers down here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","How do I explain it...? Big Guilliman smash Chaos real good. Got it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","Guilliman's pet project, ain't it. Big fella loves a good crusade."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","The Indomitus Crusade fleet is big. Like... really big."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","Don't think anyone's ever assembled a warfleet so big. Impressive."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_01","Never had much love for Cadia, but wouldn't wish that on anyone."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_02","I'll be honest, when Cadia fell I thought it was game over."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_03","Never thought I'd live to see Cadia fall."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_04","Cadia... gone. Doesn't seem real."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","They say the death toll was so high it birthed the Great Rift. How's that even work?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","Seems karking impossible."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","Things must be bad if Guilliman is back."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","They say Abaddon's armada was endless. Somehow the navy turned 'em back."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","You all had the nightmares, right? The same nightmare..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Even I felt it, and I don't have a psychic bone in my body."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","Hear the Emperor needs more soul-bindings these days. Good timing, I guess."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","Karking witches are nothing but trouble..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","I'm just glad I'm Terran-side, after what I've heard."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","Hear they got themselves all kinds of xenos trouble in the Dark Imperium."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","But that's what Guilliman is fighting for. Reunification."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Better hope the Indomitus Crusade is successful, or millions of worlds will be lost."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Yeah. The Mourningstar's proper crowded."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","I've given up counting. So many new faces. So few of them worth remembering."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","Long as they keep their thieving hands to themselves ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","The hard part's gonna be finding out which ones are lousy at Darktown Whist before word gets around."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_01","Who even is Grendyl, do you reckon? I've never seen more than that hologram."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_02","Grendyl's keeping secrets ... that much is a dead cert."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_03","I doubt Grendyl's telling us everything. Or even a part of everything."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_04","Grendyl loves being mysterious, eh? Show off."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","I don't trust someone if I've not seen their eyes."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","Hiding behind that hologram's not exactly a way to win trust."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","Let's just hope we're not being set up ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","I feel like a skeg-rat in a maze, and I don't like it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Probably got other stuff going on."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","Running some racket elsewhere, I shouldn't wonder."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","Rannick and Zola seem to have things in hand here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","It's not like we're not short of Grendyl's ... underlings."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","What does it matter? Or are you planning to refuse service if you're wrong?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Long as he's not a maniac, I couldn't much care either way."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Why the speculation? Grendyl could be a chatty servitor for all we know?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","I'm not sure Grendyl's even real. Could all be smoke and mirrors on Rannick's part."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_four_b_01","Yeah. Clear as mud, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_four_b_02","You're having a laugh, ain't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Ah, the Ogryn's going off the tone, not the words. Like I do with Morrow."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_four_c_02","Well, so long as Big Man's happy, where's the harm?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_a_01","Hadron's a bit disturbing, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_a_02","Hadron ... Anyone else a bit creeped out by that voice of hers?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_a_03","I always feel like the Tech-Priest's taking inventory whenever she looks at me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_a_04","I get the shivers whenever the Tech-Priest looks in my direction."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I know what you mean. I'm not sure she's used to people."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_b_02","She does look at me funny, now that you mention it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_c_01","I reckon she wants to put a machine in my brain, and I'm not having that!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Just don't let her near me while I'm sleeping, you hear?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Picking away at secrets, were you? Naughty."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Want to watch yourself. Snooping like that gets you shot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_three_c_01","I wish I could read minds. It'd keep the boredom at bay."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Don't ever change, Witch. You make me look like a good soldier. Me!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_two_b_01","I don't know ... She still sounds pretty human. Not like some of the rest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Maybe ... Though most of the old Tech-Priests sound more ... machine-y."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_two_c_01","I'll not make old bones. I guarantee that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hadron_two_c_02","I can't quibble. Me, I should've died years ago."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","I saw that. Don't think it's the life for me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","From what I hear, them folks don't live long. Karking death sentence."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Trust me, you don't want anything to do with her."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Keep your distance, that's what I reckon. Mug's game."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_01","That Commodore's a piece of work, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_02","The Commodore's not someone you want to cross, trust me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_03","I'd think twice before swindling Commodore Hallowette."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_04","I'm gonna take care to keep the Commodore sweet, if you follow?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","Go on, spill. I always like a cautionary tale."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Oh, gossip. I like a bit of gossip."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","Brunt walks in mortal fear of her. I don't want to know why."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","Brunt's terrified of her - you can see it in the big lug's face."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Maybe she wants to haggle? I'd certainly like to see you try."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Quit karking moaning. Woman's just trying to hustle. Nowt wrong with that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Someone's always profiting off the likes of us. Just accept it. You'll be happier."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","Dog eat dog, even aboard the Mourningstar, and Hallowette has pretty big teeth."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Don't take this wrong, but I don't come to you for character references."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","So you don't like her? I do."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","What about the fact the crew are terrified of her? Did you notice that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","The crew don't have a bad word to say about her. They just sort ... go quiet and stride off. Odd."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Powdered, soft-handed karkers. You wouldn't like 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Somebody has to keep the scum in line, right? They live up top."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Only way lowborns get to the spire is as sport in a fighting pit."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","If only you saw what these Highborns call ""entertainment""..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_a_02","Life's tough in the lower hive. S'why there's so many gangers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_a_04","Karking hive gangs..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Crime around here is out of control."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Never mind the grunts. It's the bosses you gotta watch out for."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Gets worse the lower down the hive you go."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Get in with the right sort and there's creds to be made... So I'm told."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Spiresiders don't do too bad. Downsiders are another story."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","You don't survive in the lower hive by staying on the straight and narrow. Trust me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","The gambling's good in Tertium. Or so I'm told..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Hear they distil a decent bottle of joiliq in Tertium. Not that I partake, you understand."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","We're not here to save souls. We're here to protect vital resources."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Why do you think we're here, Priest? Can't let the enemy control vital assets."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","It's gonna be a long road getting the manufactorums up and running again."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","Be a while before the metalfabs are back to capacity, if ever."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Think they'd ring the Bell of Lost Souls for us?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Trust me, the Bell of Lost Souls ain't ringing for us."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Like they'll even notice us."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_four_c_02","In my experience, heroes get you killed."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_one_a_01","You ever think about Terra? Wonder what it's like."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_one_a_03","Heard the boss going on about Terra. What do you think it's like there?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_one_a_04","Reckon Terra is all it's cracked up to be?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Never seen it. Never even met anyone who's seen it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_one_b_02","Who cares? Likes of us will never get to see it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_one_c_01","Be good to know what we're fighting for, I guess."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Reckon we'd just end up disappointed."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_three_b_01","Without the Military Tithe, I wouldn't be here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_three_b_02","I got tithed. Most Guard did. Just how it is."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_three_c_01","Administratum quill-pushers gotta justify their jobs."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_three_c_02","I pity the governor who doesn't pay up."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_two_b_01","How come every one I'm assigned to is a karking cesspit?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Doubt they'll miss this one, push comes to shove."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_two_c_01","They're mostly flattened after we're done."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Always leave 'em in worse shape than they started."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","Wouldn't mind some of their gear though. Vindicare rifles... [whistles]"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","They get the best wargear, I'll give 'em that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_a_01","Wonder how you'd Exterminatus Atoma? Theoretically speaking."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_a_03","Exterminatus... That's what I'd like to see."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","I'd go for virus bombs. Leave the manufactorums intact."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Reckon Life-Eater virus bombs would do the trick."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Never gonna happen. Atoma's too valuable."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Be crazy to blow up all these manufactorums."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","Comes in handy... now and then."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Nice being on this side of the law for a change."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","See, I never realised the Lex Imperialis was... open to interpretation."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","Never much cared for the Lex Imperialis anyway."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Creed's swagger... Here we go again."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","Ordo Xenos would've been my first choice. Honest fighting."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","Lot of sneaking about though. Not like in the Ordo Xenos."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","They say it sits on a mountain of machinery... Who knows?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","How does anything work? Best ask an Enginseer."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","If it went wrong, nobody'd know how to fix it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","Let's just hope it keeps working, or we all kark it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_a_01","Solar Macharius... Now there was a soldier."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_a_03","You all know the legend of Solar Macharius? Great soldier. Great man."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_a_04","All the lessons we could've learned from Solar Macharius... So much forgotten."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","So many worlds reclaimed. Made the Imperium what it is today."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Ah yeah... The voyages of Macharius and the Lord of Light!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","Died of jungle fever, after such a glorious campaign."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","Survived all them wars just to die of fever."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","True. All our best wargear comes from the Age of Technology."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","Might be onto something there, Witch."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","These history lessons gonna help us right now? Didn't think so."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","Focus on the here and now. Might be dead tomorrow."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","That when Goge Vandire almost brought down the Ministorum?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","I think things are quite bad enough right now, thanks."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","The Adeptus Custodes took their sweet time bringing down Vandire."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","They say the Adeptus Custodes were slow to act. Still not lived it down."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_four_b_01","Easy said. Harder proved."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_four_b_02","I thought we all were. I thought that was the point?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_four_c_01","There's no one better placed to run a few scores and all."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_four_c_02","Bet he's running a racket. Wonder if he wants some help?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_a_01","I'm a patient soul, but Melk really winds me up."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_a_02","Melk'd test the patience of a saint, and I'm no saint."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_a_03","Wish we could harness Melk's arrogance as a weapon. War'd be over in three days."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_a_04","Not sure I can take much more of Melk. Insufferable karker."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_b_01","That would be Sir Darius Melk, Holder of the Endless March and Warden of the Crux Mortem?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_b_02","I don't know a ""Melk"". But I do know a Most Beneficent Lord Darius Melk. That him?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_c_01","Oh ... stick it where the sun don't shine ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_one_c_02","That's right. Laugh it up. I'll not forget."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_three_b_01","Really? I knew I liked him."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_three_b_02","Is that so? He doesn't look the sort."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_three_c_01","I'll have to ply him with liquor, see what slithers loose."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_three_c_02","I'm sure there's a way to exploit - I mean - empathise with the poor old coot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_two_b_01","Really? Perish the thought."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_two_b_02","Now, why ever would he do that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_two_c_01","[Laughter]"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_melk_two_c_02","Oh, the look on your face!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_four_b_01","Had that happen to a mate of mine. Commissar shot him through the eye and burned the remains."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_four_c_01","You know, I don't think I've ever seen him eat ... Maybe he's metal all the way through?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_four_c_02","Don't know how you can believe it. I mean, think of that nice welcoming manner of his ... Oh ... wait ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_a_01","So the story goes, Morrow was part of nobbling old Huron Blackheart, back in the day."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_a_02","Got another nutty rumour doing the rounds - claims that Morrow fought the Tyrant of Badab."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_a_03","Got another bit of rumour for you: Morrow was at Badab. Huron Blackheart and all that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_a_04","I heard that Morrow fought at Badab. You know, against Lugft... Lufgt ... Huron Blackheart."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Sounds like another tall tale to me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Pull the other one, would you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_c_01","The more I hear around here, the less I believe."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Don't worry ... If you like stories, you're gonna love some of mine."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Yeah. And I like a good story as much as the next sucker."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_three_b_02","I like a bit of mystery. In moderation."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_three_c_01","Doesn't make the man more impressive, that's the main thing. Just makes someone a liar."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_three_c_02","Bah! The Mourningstar runs on rumour. Try not to worry about it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Load of rot! That's centuries back."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Does he look two hundred and fifty plus years old to you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_two_c_01","The Myth of Morrow, eh? I'm not signing up for that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Even if that were true, why's he still alive and everyone else dead, eh?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Packs a punch, despite her size. Can't say fairer than that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Right little scrapper, ain't she? Lots of odd tech hidden away too."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","She ain't exactly standard pattern, from what I've seen ... not that I care."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Bears her scars well. Let's just hope they don't split and spit us out into the void."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_four_b_01","You expect folk like him to get their hands dirty? He'd faint at the sight of blood."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Gets his jollies sending others in to die, don't he?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Wouldn't mind seeing him in harm's way. Good for morale. Namely, mine."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_four_c_02","If we ever see him planetside, we'll know it's gotten real nasty."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_a_01","Whenever Rannick looks at me, I feel like he's sizing me up for ready burial."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_a_02","Rannick always seems surprised I'm still alive. Hurtful."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_a_03","Rannick's distant fellow, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_a_04","Never really sure where I stand with Rannick, if I'm honest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Having the Inquisitorial Seal so close gives a man swagger, and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_b_02","He's arrogant, sure, but he's got much to be arrogant about."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Thinks he's better than us, don't he? But you've gotta wonder where Grendyl found him."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_one_c_02","Long as he stays out of my way, we're golden."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_three_b_01","Certainly filling out those boots of his. Might be getting too big for them, in fact."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Got the look of an ambitious man. Wonder how that's going down with his master?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_three_c_01","I still don't trust him. I don't like his eyes."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_three_c_02","So what if he's going somewhere. You and me? We're going nowhere but an unmarked grave."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_two_b_01","So he doesn't bow and scrape like you do? Everyone worships in their own way."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_two_b_02","I reckon that's the Emperor's business. Not yours."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_two_c_01","He's still the boss. That's all that matters."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_rannick_two_c_02","He's in charge. We're in the ranks. You want to pick a fight with him, well ... it was almost nice knowing you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_a_01","Don't much care for servitors. Creepy dead eyes and flat voices."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_a_02","I wish there weren't so many servitors on the Mourningstar. Creepy little karkers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_a_03","Servitors are always watching, everywhere I karking go."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_a_04","Servitors ... I can't stand the nasty little karkers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Nasty little tech-zombies. All watching with their dead eyes."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_b_02","Can you not smell the grave whenever one lurches past?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_c_01","You want to be careful. Misbehave, and Hadron'll hollow you out. You'll be one of them."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_servitors_one_c_02","As long as no one's eyeing me up for surgery ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","I bet the Mechanicus has a hand in it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","Experiments. Dark experiments."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Wouldn't mind some power armour though, eh?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","Bet that power armour helps a bit, too."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_01","Where's the karking Space Marines when you need 'em?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_02","About time the boss called in some Space Marines."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_03","Karking Space Marines should be taking care of this."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_04","How many have to die before we call in some Space Marines?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Space Marines? Here? You'll be lucky."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","You ever seen one close up? Inspiring, but... terrifying."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Imagine if they sent the Blood Angels... Things'd get messy."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","They say one Space Marine's worth a hundred soldiers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","I'll believe it when I see it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","Yeah, yeah. Next you'll be saying Cadia didn't burn."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Now, Rogal Dorn... there was a Primarch."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Time'll tell if he makes a difference."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","Just a load of squad designations, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","You should really get out more, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","It split the Space Marine legions into chapters... big deal."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Don't know why you lot worship scraps of old parchment."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","He's a dead guy. So... Not great."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","Been dead ten thousand years. Can't be much of a looker."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Maybe we'll find out for sure in the next life."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","Stow it. Best not tempt His wrath, eh."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_a_02","Does the Emperor give orders? Or is he just sort of... psychic."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_a_03","S'pose the Emperor must talk, right? Else how do we know his will?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","He don't speak. Just sort of... thinks it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He's the original psyker. Don't need to speak."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","His orders come down from the High Lords of Terra, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","Probably some karking psychic malarkey."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Yeah, don't like to think about that too much."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","I mean... Does he literally eat them? Nasty..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","No survival without fire. No fire without kindling."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","Survival of the fittest. Can't all be Astropaths."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","Yeah... When my time comes, just put me out of my misery."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","Golden Throne's just a fancy prison if you ask me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","If he's planning on coming back, he's taking his sweet time."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","I put my faith in what I can see with my own eyes."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Try not to think about it, Big Man. It'll give you nightmares."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Ship go poof. Move real fast. Pop out somewhere else. Get it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Used to plug psykers into the engines. Don't think they do that anymore..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Remember when they just plugged psykers into the engines? Good times."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_01","[Ugh] My insides still haven't settled after my last Warp jump..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_02","I hate Warp jumps. Turn me inside out every time."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_03","Karking hate Warp travel. My last jump was rough."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_04","Know what I hate most? Warp travel."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","Creed's swagger... Just pray we never get lost in the Warp."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","Imagine getting lost in the Warp... [Ugh]"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","Short, controlled jumps. That's the secret."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","If a jump's more than five light years, it's time to worry."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Friend of mine back home used to be younger than me. Not any more."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Least time only flows forward, right? Right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","Explains how so many generals have been around for so long."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","S'pose we should be thankful for Navigators."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","Warp entities, yeah? Always there, in the corner of your eye."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Warp entities. Give me the karking creeps."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Long as the Gellar Fields hold, we'll be safe. Probably."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","Chin up - this is why we have Gellar Fields."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Get away! You're funny in the head."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Oh aye? Can't say I saw that coming."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","I suppose as surprises go this one's harmless."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","She probably thinks he's some sort of pet."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_01","Not sure I like that psyker they've got doing the training."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_02","The training psyker ... She's a cold one."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_03","Can't help but shudder whenever Sefoni speaks to me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_04","The Psykhanium? That's weird, but I can cope with it. It's Sefoni's voice that does for me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","Gives me goosebumps, she does, and not the good kind."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","It's reached the point where even looking at her sets me shuddering."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","I wish there was another way of training ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","I'd prefer training with live targets. Orks. Anything!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","If you want me for your little club, I politely decline."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Not really my idea of a confidant, if I'm honest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Have you noticed how it's always cold when she's nearby?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Temperature drops whenever she comes close. Don't say you've not noticed."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","If you didn't need so much training it wouldn't be a problem, would it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","Getting hot and bothered won't change anything."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Training's training. Just count the hours 'till it's done."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","Anyhow, I'm not sure anyone cares if you're not enjoying yourself."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","You wait until we come under fire. That'll keep your eyes open."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","You ain't seen nothing yet. Wait until the heretics start sending up interceptors."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Ah, give over. It's not like complaining will change anything."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","You'll get used to it. Everyone does ... eventually."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_war_end_b_01","Sure. Just got to put the boot in harder than the other lot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_war_end_b_02","You never bet against the Guard, Big Man. You know that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_war_end_c_01","Makes no difference to me. I was born for this!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_war_end_c_02","Long as there's ammo, I'll keep fighting."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Creed's swagger, who's been telling the big 'un about hybrids?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Shouldn't listen to that stuff, Big Man. Give you nightmares."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_four_c_01","The longer they go undiscovered, the more human they look. Creepy."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_four_c_02","Where there's hybrids, there's a Broodlord nearby. Nasty great karkers..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_a_01","You've all fought xenos, right? Or is it just me?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_a_02","Not sure what's worse: Heretics or xenos."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_a_03","Anybody else miss sticking it to the xenos scum?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_a_04","Could be worse. Could be facing xenos."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_b_01","I hear you. Least you can take an alien down once you know how."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Yeah, just give me something I can shoot, you know?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_c_01","I dunno. I faced an Ork charge once, wouldn't fancy doing it again."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_one_c_02","I'd rather be here than staring down a greenskin charge."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_three_b_01","I hear they take aliens along on Ordo Xenos missions."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_three_b_02","Reckon there's more alien tech in the Imperium than you might think."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_three_c_01","You must have heard of Xenarch weapons? Worth a karking fortune..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_three_c_02","I'll use whatever you put in my hands, long as it does the job."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_two_b_01","Fast karkers though. They die easy, if you can hit 'em!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_two_b_02","Fighting the karkers is like trying to grapple water."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_two_c_01","Just be thankful there aren't many of 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_xenos_two_c_02","I'm just glad they don't have numbers on their side, or we'd be history."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_four_b_01","Ah, she's a big softy really ... Don't tell her I said that, mind."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_four_b_02","Don't need to tell me that. I've seen her work first hand."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_four_c_01","Don't know why anyone's surprised, really."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_four_c_02","Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can all stop sucking up to her now."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_a_01","If you ask me, Zola's wound tighter than most Commissars."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_a_02","That explicator's a laugh a minute, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_a_03","Tough crowd, that explicator. I've seen more smiles in a mass grave."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_a_04","That explicator needs to ease up. Like ... a lot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_b_01","Her sort's all show. Soft as rotten fruit inside, I bet."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_b_02","Aye. Could be worse."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_c_01","As long as she doesn't go funny, it'll work out."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_one_c_02","That sort snaps too easy. Want to place a wager on how soon?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_three_b_01","Simple folk don't last long at the front lines."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_three_b_02","Gotta have a bit of gumption to stay alive around here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_three_c_01","Ah, she's all right. Give or take."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_three_c_02","Don't wish her away. At least she's friendly. Sometimes ... At least, I think so."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_two_b_01","There's more to faith than your showy nonsense, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_two_b_02","The book of regs is my only deity. Or at least the loopholes therein."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_two_c_01","Eh ... Whatever works for you, and all that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__lore_zola_two_c_02","Long as Zola keeps a clear head and doesn't get us killed, I'm happy."
"loc_veteran_female_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Got what we came for!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Come here, you little karker!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_alarm_01","It's like we rang a dinner gong!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_alarm_02","Where's the karking alarm shut-off?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","Karking locked down ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","Don't think we're moving that door without something big and angry."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","I'm not much of one for reading. Wouldn't know where to start in here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Looks ordered enough, but I'm not buying it. I bet they can't find anything in here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Any clues as to who the Inquisitors hoping to catch out? You can tell me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Pick up a rock, find a traitor. The bigger the rock, the more traitors."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","Not a place for people, this. Scribes aside, it's servitors all the way down."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Can you imagine being here when it's quiet - half-dead cyborgs shushing you to silence?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","So ... if we're the good guys, why do we spend so much time traipsing around sewers?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","I hope your boots are waterproof ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Shame we're doing it this way. I always wanted to drive a chuffing train ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Are you sure I can't drive the train? Go on. Be a sport."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Oh, you're no fun. Did anyone ever tell you that?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","You're a killjoy. Plain and simple."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Oi, Tech Priest. What are you in for anyway? How did you end up on the Mourningstar?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You think you're better than us, don't you Tech Priest?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Come again?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","You what?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","This support team had better be quick off the mark."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Our support team know we're all at the target?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","We won't need them anyway. You'll see."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","And who says we can't get it karking done without them? Precisely."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","All this activity! Makes me tired just looking at it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","I do like work. I could watch it all day."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Are we going round in circles? Feels like it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","I give up! This place is a karking maze!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Let's hope we don't meet whatever made that hole!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Looks like someone made a stand here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Look at these toy soldiers. Oi lads! Want to come where the real fighting is?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","Look at this lot. A heavy sneeze'd take them all out!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","So, have we seen the last of the Water Cartel?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","The Water Cartel's taken a real pasting, haven't they?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Sounds like you're holding a grudge. I can get behind that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","You've a nasty streak, explicator. It suits you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Gangs are normally close-knit. Must have slipped up for the heretics to take 'em over."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","No easy task taking over a hive gang from inside. Trust me, I know."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","They were sloppy, that's all. Needed a real maestro in command, if you know what I mean?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Get lax, get whacked. Got it. This job's a real eye opener."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","You been running errands for the Inquisitor long, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","From the Torrent's slums to the ranks of the Holy Inquisition? Not bad, explicator."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Fine. Keep your secrets. I bet they're dead boring anyway."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Oooh. Hit a nerve, maybe? Makes me want to keep digging."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Shame the cartel's been wiped out. Might have been a better billet than this …"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Not much difference between cartel and enforcers, if you ask me. Different uniforms is all."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","You don't suppose they actually … eat some of that, do you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","I bet the Guard do fine recruiting around here. I'd rather eat a bullet than whatever it is they're sifting."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","You see the state of those hab blocks? This place just gets better and better."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","Desirable location. Lovely views. Charming neighbours. It's a wonder more folk don't live here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Looks like there's been another shootout. I wonder who won this round?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","They've been fighting again. You know it might be for entertainment, not to see who's in charge."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_shanty_01","What a mess! I've seen some crummy places in my time, but this is something special."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_shanty_02","Lovely. Just the kind of place that makes you want to put down roots, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_water_course_01","Take my advice, don't go for a dip over the side of the bridge."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cartel_water_course_02","Look at that river. Not exactly a spot for skinny dipping, is it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Elevator's on the karking way! Let's have a kill competition before it arrives!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Elevator's gonna take a while! Get ready to fight!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Was I imagining all those nice, big comms arrays on the Mourningstar?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","Karking busywork, this. The Mourningstar could send this away in a heartbeat."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","The uniform changes, but that's it. Always neck deep in dung."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","I'll look forward to getting a knife in the back. I could use the kip."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","So ... where are we sending this transmission, exactly?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","Transmission going out to another of Grendyl's mates?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Yeah, yeah, yeah. You enjoy your secrets."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","It's okay. I don't care anyway, long as I'm paid."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","What's in the transmission? Go on. You can tell me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","The transmission's got to include something juicy for all this trouble."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Didn't think it was Grendyl's recipe book."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Wouldn't want to read it. Sounds like a parade of numbers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Suicide party, reporting for duty!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Looks like another day of death or glory, hold the glory."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_way_in_01","Ain't nothing special, but this should get us inside!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_complex_way_in_02","Aha! This looks like our way in: servitors, traders and covert strike teams only."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Any chance this place'll be restored to full function? You know, if there's not a kaboom."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","This all looks pretty beat up to me. Reckon they can fix it when we're done?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Yeah … That's what I was thinking as well. Every last word."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Oi, tech priest! You need to use shorter words!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Saving the manufactorum's one thing, but it'll still need workers, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","We can save the karking building, but the heretics killed all the workers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That's what I like about you, tech priest: all that warm humanity you've got sloshing around inside."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Have a little respect. Those are people you're talking about!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Lot of karking bother for one tank factory. Is it really that important?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Is one tank factory really that important? Why are we down here?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Well, I'd hate to be doing all this for no karking reason."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Better get to it. I've a reputation as a karking miracle worker to consider."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_heat_01","Bad enough that we're walking into an enormous bomb, but does it have to be so hot?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_heat_02","Karking hel! I hate the heat at the best of times, but this is something else."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_leaving_01","We've not died in an explosion. That feels like a win."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_leaving_02","No kaboom today. I can live with that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","It's a fair old drop, ain't it? You could lose a hab block in here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Lot of stairs ahead. My poor old aching legs…"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Overseer's Office. Finally! Coolant Control had better be close."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","I'm karking melting. Don't suppose you want to carry me to Coolant Control?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Leman Russ armour plates? Could use one of those tanks right now, couldn't we?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Wonder if old Rannick would let us have a Leman Russ … you know, if we asked nicely?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Workers have converted this place to a makeshift hab. Rather them than me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Look at those bunks! No way to live, is it? I'll take my chances on the front lines."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_deception_01","Bit of a dirty trick, uploading false intel … but I like dirty tricks."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_deception_02","Why are we bothering with false intel? We should plant a bomb, blow the whole thing to pieces!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","[Shudder] Gives me the creeps. Like being up before a Commissar."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Won't see me weeping over a ruined courthouse."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Typical enforcers. Never around when they're needed."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Hard to believe there were ever any enforcers around here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Always got to look after number one. No other way to live."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","You prop yourselves up on lawkeepers, you'll always fall over."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","I bet you're no stranger to these Blocks, explicator? Go on. Spill."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","These are your old stomping grounds, aren't they explicator?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Thing is, you've got me more interested than ever."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","I'm starting to think you and I might have a lot in common."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Never thought I'd be breaking into prison. Breaking out? Been there, done that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","This is a backwards kind of jailbreak, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Oh yeah. That looks dead safe, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Are all the habs raised up on stilts? Doesn't look at all safe."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","Nice locale. Just where you want to put down roots."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","Fine old place, ain't it? Slippery floors, troubling echoes and a smell you can cut with a knife."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","Catch a lungful of that! 'Rank' doesn't begin to describe it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","Reminds me of the time I was digging latrines for the Tempestus Scions."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","Everything's shut up. And I could use a shopping spree!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","What a jolly little trading street... I don't think."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Could be me, but I'm not sure this should be a slope."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","Cheeky little floor they've got in this place, but I like mine level."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_alive_01","Smelter's waking up!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_alive_02","Yeah! The smelter's waking up!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","All this for a few Leman Russes. Doesn't seem worth it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","What's so special about this place anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Don't suppose I can get some of that hardened armour for myself?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Say no more. The longer the tanks last, the better. Means I'm not getting shot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","You talk a lot, Tech Priest, but never about yourself."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Fancy telling us something about yourself, Tech Priest? It'll pass the time."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Look at us, becoming friends. We'll have you smiling next."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Careful ... You don't want to get too emotional. You'll sprain something."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Stupid karking heretics. I could shut this place down for good with enough meltabombs."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Heretics are doing this the hard way. They want this place shut, level it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Leman Russ reinforcements for the heretics?  No thank you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Yeah, that sounds like a world of pain for the rest of us."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Where is this karking smelter anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Can we find this karking smelter? I want out of here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_hellhole_01","It's getting hot ... Let's get out of here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_hellhole_02","I'm karking melting. Can we leave now?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Can't imagine it's normally so quiet around here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_lifeless_02","Heretics aside, it's a karking ghost town down here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","There we go! Right in through the front door."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","We're going in through the front door? Subtle."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Lots of cheery posters. Gives me a nice warm glow, I don't think."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_propaganda_02","I couldn't work in a place like this. Give me a suicide mission any day."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Cornered? Yes! Easy pickings? No karking way!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","We'll have to hold out until the elevator's here!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","[Whooping Breath] Can't hardly breathe. Yeah, this'll be fun."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Air's tangy, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Rannick seems desperate to keep this place. Wonder what he's not telling us?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Must be a karking important manufactorum, this."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_hack_01","Time to go data thieving. Sounds good to me!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_hack_02","Bit of data thieving, is it? Let's hit up something dead valuable next time, yes?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","Part shanty town. Part junkyard. All nasty."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","These heretics live like packrats, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Lots of nasty stuff hereabouts. Anything you maybe missed on the briefing?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Looks like sentient sewer in here. What's the karking deal?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Oh, I do so like surprises. Honest."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Isn't that lovely? No. No it's not."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","You want to tell me why there's a daemon here at all?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Karking daemons. What's it doing here?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","[Spit] Filthy karking heretics."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","As if I needed one more reason to hate the heretic scum."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Let's hope the karking daemon's satisfied with this building."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","This daemon… is it confined to Sector Periferus?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Fire. That's what we need. Lots and lots of fire."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Bah! I'll take it on. Just let me at the big guns."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Looks like that elevator's already at capacity."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","Something nasty in that lift shaft..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Won't find me getting won over by some heretic broadcast. Will of adamantium, that's me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Heretics are wasting their time trying to put their hoodoo on me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Getting dizzy. Bet we're a long way up."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I bet it's a long way down from where we are."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Schlep, schlep, schlep. Just once, I'd like to arrive in style."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","My legs are aching already. Why do we have to walk everywhere?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Breath that down. I'll start missing all those chems in the ventilation system."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","Get a lungful of that. Sure, it burns a little but it's free of tranqs. Unlike lower down."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","You know, it's almost pleasant out here. Don't suppose we can stay?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Now this is more like it! Much better than the grubby levels down below."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","We're karking trapped!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","Oh, so it's a trap. Got it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","Sneaky little heretics, sealing us in."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","Hang on ... What's happening?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Vox is dead. So are we."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Vox has gone dark."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Want to bet the Mourningstar set us up?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","I told you Grendyl wanted us dead!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Fine, but I ain't going down easy!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","They want me, I'm right here!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","I'm not dying easy, I can tell you that!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","Bring it on, heretic scum!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_02","Looks like a karking skyfire command relay. We'd better disable it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_district_gate_01","Karkers have sealed this district up. I wonder if anyone escaped?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_district_gate_02","No one's getting out that way ... If there's anyone left alive to escape."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Lot of trouble to get here. I hope it was worth it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Why's this karking place so important?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Count me out of the assault. We only got this far because they didn't see us coming."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Taking this place head-on is a karking death sentence."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You know plenty about this place, explicator. I thought you were a Torrent-rat?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Hey, explicator. How does a Torrent-rat know so much about this district?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Not so pure and fluffy as you seem, are you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","I karking knew it! Say ... can you get me one or two ... ? Nah, forget it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Special issue ammo? I've not seen hide nor hair of any back on the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Do I get to keep some of this special issue ammo? I'm a connoisseur."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Now that's not fair. Not that you care, of course."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Karking typical. All of the work, none of the reward."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","That hab block looks familiar. Then again, they all do."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","Least we're not sealed up in that karking hab block."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","Going in the pretty way, I see?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","I guess we're not seeing the sights today?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_trains_01","Not sure I like having trains rattle past above my head ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_rails_trains_02","Let's hope the karking gantries don't collapse while the trains are passing ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Heretics everywhere. Just how I like it!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","Come on you karkers! Come out and play!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","You sure that karking bridge is moving?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","And that's where they all died, waiting for a bridge. Not very heroic."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","But I don't want to cross something call ""The Bridge of Many Martyrs""."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","Martyrdom isn't very ""me"". But what the hel ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","Oi! Do we look like engineers?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","If it's more complicated than pulling a lever, we might be in trouble."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","Just once I'd like the karkers to realise they ain't gonna win this one!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","Target rich environment. Just how I like it!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Bring 'em on says I! I was getting bored!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","I'll have yours if you don't want 'em!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","Preacher's pulpit. Bet he was the first to run when it got sticky."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","You can always trust a preacher to scarper when the fighting starts. No staying power."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","Let's give the heretics one for him. Or two. Or twelve!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","Ah, he'll be fine. That sort always are."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Well, well, well. Clean floors, cleanish air ... must be going up in the world."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Starting to get into the nicer parts are we? About karking time."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_retrieve_01","What does Morrow think I am? A karking pack grox?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_retrieve_02","Fetch. Carry. Fetch. Carry. Another riveting day in the service of Inquisitor Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scan_01","So, this servo-skull we've been set up with ... you reckon it's worth anything?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scan_02","Once the mission's done, let's see if we can't flog this servo-skull to one of the mud thumpers back at HQ."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","Nice to be within spitting distance of fresh air again. As fresh as it gets on this Hel hole, anyway."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Look at that! A bit of honest-to-duty daylight! Bright, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Not exactly a place you'd want to settle down, is it? Or even hide out. How long's it been this way?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","This place doesn't exactly sell the idea of the Emperor's Glory, does it? Been like this long?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Better off leaving it well alone, if you ask me. No point trying to fix the mistakes of the past. I know all about that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Well, nothing worth saving here now. Job well done by Tertium's administratum, and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Lovely. A great big Vault full of plagues, and we're heading right into it? Just my karking luck."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","You know, if we had any sense we'd be heading in the other direction - you know, away from the plague Vault?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Revolting little creeps. Someone ought to put them out of our misery. Oh, wait. We will."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Filthy little karkers. Death's too good for them."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I bet loads of merchant craft came through here … You know, before it went to rot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Bet these skies would have been a lot busier if you went back a couple of centuries."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","The past is the past. I'm more worried about surviving the present."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Leave the past where it is. The present's dangerous enough."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_interior_01","This karking place is ready to collapse! More more hive quake and it'll come down on us!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Yeah. Lovely. Come all this way, and the lot will probably collapse on us."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","This isn't a servitor colony, it's a karking tomb. Some of the inhabitants aren't dead yet, that's all."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","What a karking mess! How is any of it still working?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Hello … Looks like the cargo elevator's where we need it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","Looks like our path's clear. Let's hope the cargo elevator's sturdier than it looks."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","Too many karking corridors if you ask me. It's ambush city!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","Let's keep moving. Too karking easy to get surrounded down here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_approach_01","And there we go - Chasm Terminus. Showy, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_approach_02","Station's in sight. Gotta tell you, I'm not thrilled to be marching up to the front door."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Whoever lands the final shot buys the drinks, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","Let's show this karker who they're dealing with!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","Just sit back and enjoy the screams!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just let me get to work."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What's waiting for us down there?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Can you tell us anything more about this karker?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Just as well I like a challenge, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","In the Guard or out of it, it's never easy."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","Nice decor. Just the thing for when you're peeling brains apart."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","It's a magistratum catechizer post, isn't it? Places like this give me the shudders."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Maybe we should redirect a couple of supply trains while we're at it. You know, pinch some of the good stuff from the heretics?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Let's say we do kill our target. Can one man really be that important?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","You know, you're a real buzzkill sometimes, explicator."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Anyone ever tell you that you're a mite touchy, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","I love ambushes. Never give a sucker an even break."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Don't know about anyone else, but I reckon this should be fun."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","And this way's more fun as well, so there's that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","If you say so. I just know I'm going to karking enjoy this."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","I still say this'd have been easier to do at Chasm Terminus."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","This is a karking joke. We should have gone straight to the station - done everything from there."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","If you say so. I say you're karking mad."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Well, if it works, it works. I try to be practical about these things."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","Piquet-line duty, is it? Rather them than me."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","This lot have been here awhile. You can see it in their smiling faces."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_station_hall_01","Look at all this mess! I bet the station commandant's spinning in his shallow grave."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_station_hall_02","This place has seen better days, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Woo-hoo! Do you see that to the south? We're not the only ones having fun!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_station_the_bridge_02","Bit of a light-show off to the south. Care to place a bet on which side wins?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","I thought the Cartel would spring for nicer quarters..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Not exactly the romantic ideal of the criminal life, is it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","This place is so nasty... it's no wonder a daemon ended up down here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Ain't right, having a daemon burrowing around and about..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Wish I'd brought a bigger gun..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I knew it! Should have stayed in bed."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Does Rannick have a plan for taking the Torrent back?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Seems we'd do better to take back the Torrent."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","You don't sound like you agree."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","You're not thinking he has the right of it, are you?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I kinda like it down here. Reminds me of my youth."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Bet this place was a riot before the heretics took over."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I like it more already."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","You don't say? You're just making me curious now."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","A holo statue? Bit showy for down here, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","A holo statue? Expensive. Don't suppose we could, you know, salvage it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","I like what they've done with the gateway. Or I would, if we didn't have to go around."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","Main entrance is karking sealed. We'll have to find another way."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","It's all rotting. What's in the air down here anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","See the state of those walls. That's acid damage."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Probably best not to ask what's in the water before it gets purified..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","You know, compared to a lot of the hive, this place looks in good nick."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","[Cough] Some use that atmospheric shield is. Every breath's a mouthful of karking grit."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","That atmospheric shield's more gap than metal ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_crossroads_01","Would it have killed them to install some signposts?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Well, this sure doesn't look like somewhere we could get lost ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Hang on ... We're inside the refinery - are we inside the daemon too?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","Hold up a moment ... are we in the daemon's stomach now?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","Dry as a bone. These aren't the chambers we're after."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","Karking empty. Keep looking!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Lucky for us, we're really good at persuading folk to let us into places."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","Nothing a bit of firepower can't fix, I'm sure."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","This elevator's a real bone-rattler, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","You hear that? I think one of the cables is on its last legs."

"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","So you'd rather I didn't jump up and down, is that right?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","You'd need an army to do that. Don't suppose you've got one to spare?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","It'll be harder than you think. These karkers have made this place their own."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","All this talk about daemons. That's karking mad, isn't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","So, let's see if I heard right before ... That was a daemon?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Never get a straight karking answer around here, do we?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Ask a silly question, get a worthless answer. It's like being back in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","You do know we'll all be exposed to this karking disease, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","I hope we're all feeling robust ... otherwise this pathogen will rip right through us."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","Fine comfort that'll be once the projectile dysentery kicks in."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Karking wonderful. Sounds like we're as good as dead."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","Lot of talk about this pathogen, and not a lot of karking detail ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","What sort of pathogen have we got here anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Is anyone else suddenly feeling a bit itchy?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh, that's the stuff of nightmares, right there!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","Ain't this cosy? Rust, ruin and all the dust you can eat."
"loc_veteran_female_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","You keep sending us to the nicest places. Spoilt, that's what we are."
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_01","It's attacking!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_02","Get clear!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_03","Watch out!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_04","Look out!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_05","Get out of there!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_06","Don't let it hit you!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_07","Looks like you made it mad!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_08","You made it angry!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_09","It doesn’t like you!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_combo_attack_10","Idiot! Get clear!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","At last! A challenge!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Come on, ugly! What've you got?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","We've got this, guys and gals!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","Time to go to work!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Are we ready? Karking right!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","Give it a good smacking!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","Let's show ugly how we do things!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","I've killed tougher!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","That's gonna be a problem…"
"loc_veteran_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","Let's take it apart!"

"loc_veteran_female_b__need_rescue_03","Oi! Cut me loose!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__need_rescue_04","You waiting for an invitation? Rescue me!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__need_rescue_05","Get me karking loose! I want payback!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","Ugh. If I never see another scrap of daemon-goop, it'll be too soon."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","So much goop. That daemon must be really big. Or there are plenty of 'em."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","Message received, loud and clear."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","I do enjoy our little chats."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","You know, seeing all this corruption gives me an itchy feeling."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","It's a real mess hereabouts, ain't it? Atoma's getting worse."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","Oh, now the claws come out. And I was just starting to like you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","Got it. Mouth shut, even when we're screaming. Same old, same old."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","Wouldn't catch me bending the knee to a god of pus and maggots."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","Praying to a god of disease? These heretics are mad!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","Stupid karkers. Death's too good for them."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","I reckon their brains are the first thing to rot."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","Surely we've killed enough heretics that they get the message: Nurgle can't save you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","Nurgle doesn't seem to offer much salvation while we're around ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Well, it's not exactly something you use in regular conversation."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","Have it your way. I'm not looking for trouble."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","Is it even worth saving the hive? I mean, look at the place!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","Such a karking mess! This hive's done for, I tell you."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","Ah, you make it sound so easy."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","Looks a lot easier from up there, I bet."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_01","I reckon that's karking alive!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_02","What a horrible lump of flesh that is ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_03","Oi, ugly. Don't get comfortable - someone'll come back here with a flamer."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_04","Well, well, well ... Aren't you an ugly karker?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_05","Rannick ain't paying enough for me to look at ... that."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_06","Don't want to worry you, but that thing looks alive."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_07","Oh, isn't nature wonderful? Not that there's anything natural about that ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_08","Now that ... ? That doesn't belong. Not one little bit."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_09","Not a pretty sight. Not even by the standards on Atoma."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_10","Isn't life wonderful? Do you reckon we can kill it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_01","Gonna take more than a broom to clean this place up."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_02","Reminds me of my first barracks, only it's cleaner."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_03","It's like an officer's conscience in here: suspect and sticky."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_04","Now, I know the walls look tasty, but don't you go licking them."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_05","Physical blight? Check. Urge to vomit? Strong."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_06","The Dregs actually want it this way, don't they? Stupid karkers."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_07","Looks bad. Smells bad. Don't touch it, is my advice."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_08","Might need to do a bit of planetary redecorating before we're done, eh?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_09","Now that's all kinds of wrong."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_10","Don't mind me ... [Disgusted Noise] I'm just keeping my rations down ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_01","Look at that! Heretics have made themselves a shrine ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_02","What a horrible shrine that is."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_03","Is it me, or does that shrine look ... alive?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_04","Don't much care for the heretics' taste in decor ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_05","I'm not much of one for worship, but I know when someone's doing it wrong ..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_06","Check out that shrine! Ugly ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_07","Is that a shrine? Hard to tell under all that muck."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_08","Oh look! The heretics have tried to make themselves a shrine!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_09","Do you suppose they pray at that thing?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_10","They don't pray at that thing ... do they?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","Karking typical. Didn't I tell you this would be a bad one?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","Great."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","And what's the good news? Please tell me that wasn't the good news..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","Yeah [Coughing] I reckon I can smell it."
"loc_veteran_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_01","Heavy fire!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_02","Pinned down!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_03","Too much karking fire!"

"loc_veteran_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_03","Don't hit the karking armour!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_04","Aim where it's weak!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_06","Find the weakpoint!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_07","Not! The! Armour!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_08","You're hitting armour!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_09","The armour? Why!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_10","Not the karking armour!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__power_circumstance_start_b_01","Time to do a bit of creeping around? I can get behind that."

"loc_veteran_female_b__prologue_monologue_08","Come on then heretic scum…"
"loc_veteran_female_b__prologue_monologue_09","Need to keep moving before they pump in the tox gas. That elevator'll get me out. I hope."

"loc_veteran_female_b__region_carnival_a_01","Looks like my kind of place. Here, are we on leave?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_carnival_a_02","I reckon I'd fit right in down here."
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_carnival_a_03","Not bad. Reckon we can stick around and see the sights?"
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_habculum_01","You never know ... you get all sorts in a Sector Habculum. Might make some useful ... connections."
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_habculum_02","They pack 'em in tight down here, you know. No wonder it smells bad."
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_habculum_03","Lots of corridors and turns in this place. Stay sharp!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_mechanicus_01","So this place is a weapons factory? I call dibs on any decent guns lying around."
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_mechanicus_02","It's a karking warren, ain't it? Can't imagine working down here, much less living."
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_mechanicus_03","War and machines - the two legs that the Imperium stands on..."
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_periferus_01","It's a karking wasteland out here. No wonder the heretics took over so easily."
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_periferus_02","Right on the edge of civilisation out here, such as it is. I like it!"
"loc_veteran_female_b__region_periferus_03","There's places like this on every world in the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_female_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_01","Gun's dry!"

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_02_b_01","Aye, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_05_b_01","We stand together."

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_18_b_01","Just keep putting them down."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_20_b_01","Vengeance is truth, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_06_b_01","Won't have to wait long, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_07_b_01","Doesn't matter - you still have to fight or die."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_08_b_01","We're killing the enemy. There's pleasure in that."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_09_b_01","As they should."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_13_b_01","It's coming, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_14_b_01","Understood."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_01_b_01","Serve and be rewarded..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_05_b_01","No."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_09_b_01","Don't think, just kill."

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_b_01","Means nothing. War is suffering. You fight until it's won."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_b_01","I've heard more foolish things, but not many."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_16_b_01","You want quiet? Then shut up."

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_17_b_01","No. I know you're an abomination."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_b_01","Were here to engage and destroy the enemy. Your gratification's nothing to do with it."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_08_b_01","For once, yes."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_b_01","We're here to kill the enemy. Anything else is irrelevant."

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_b_01","Same as life everywhere - a battlefield."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_b_01","Copy!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_14_b_01","Negative. Cadia taught me everything I need."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","You're not from Cadia. You've not seen the other kind."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_03_b_01","Maybe. Your point?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_06_b_01","Worse is coming, for sure."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_b_01","No."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_b_01","Rest when you're dead."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_b_01","While you're a poor excuse for a soldier."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_14_b_01","Agree on both counts."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_01_a_01","Survival's not likely, but mission success is still possible."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_a_01","I don't trust any of you. Clear?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_03_a_01","Time to count the ammo and offer our prayers."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_04_a_01","Cadia fell and places like this endure. Where's the justice in that?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_04_b_01","No justice, only vengeance."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_a_01","Though I walk with the weak, I remain strong."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_07_a_01","Hear that? That quiet is the sound of fate breathing in before vomiting all over us."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_08_a_01","Want to hear a truth? We're dead already. Just a question of when it catches up with us."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_08_b_01","Grave's dug, but I'm not going to lie in it yet."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_a_01","If the fight goes bad, take as many of them with you as you can."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_10_a_01","Weakness. That's why places like this fall."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_11_a_01","This place is gone. Kill the rot then burn the ruins."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_12_a_01","If we hit trouble, bullets will see us through before prayers."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_12_b_01","Every kill-shot's a prayer to the Emperor."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_a_01","Think about killing first and surviving second, and you might make it through."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_14_a_01","More shots on target next time. Sharpen up. All of you."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_15_a_01","It's quiet... big attack's coming soon."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_16_a_01","Do better next time. I'll not have us shame the dead of Cadia."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_16_b_01","For Cadia..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_17_a_01","I've seen better than us go into zones like this and not come out. Stay sharp."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_18_a_01","We're damned. That's why we're still alive. The good and pure are already in their graves."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_19_a_01","Take my advice: Give up hope. Hold onto vengeance. That's all."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_20_a_01","Mission is still on! Tighten up!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_20_b_01","Copy that!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_01_b_01","Affirmative. Their taint's everywhere."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_03_b_01","True as true."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_04_b_01","Vengeance is its own reward."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_07_b_01","No need to understand them. Just end them."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_16_b_01","Vengeance is the Emperor's truth."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_17_b_01","That's the truth."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_01_b_01","Leave only ashes."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_03_b_01","And they shall burn. All of them."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_04_b_01","Negative. Think, then execute. Anything else is a shortcut to failure."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_07_b_01","The Emperor's not been this way for a long while, priest."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_16_b_01","No, Priest. We get ourselves out of this."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_17_b_01","And we are that harvest."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_b_01","Down to you, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_05_b_01","Seeing the enemy dead is enough for me."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_09_b_01","Then why mention it?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_13_b_01","If you say so."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_17_b_01","Never has. Never will."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Quiet, ain't it? Yeah, it worries me as well."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_02","We have a job to do. Let's get out there and karking do it!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_03","All this standing around makes me nervous. Let's move out!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Nothing like a killing spree to shake the cobwebs."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_05","Emperor's Throne... I have missed being in the field."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Think we scared them off? Shame."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_07","You see anything that isn't one of us lot, you put it down."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_08","We may not be the Imperium's finest, but we're still amazing."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_09","Death waits. And glory, perhaps, but mostly death."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Let's hope the Emperor really is watching us."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","It's just a word. Don't worry about it, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","It's short for 'absolutely human'. I promise."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","You telling me how to fight? What a laugh."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","Keep your gun up and your advice to yourself."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","If you didn't shoot at every shadow..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","You waste ammo, you lose ammo. Simple maths."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Limited ammo doesn't mean limited to you!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","We're all trying to survive here. Share the ammo!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Share the ammo. Won't warn you again."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","You want ammo? Find your own."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","I'm doing more good with this ammo than you are!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Situation normal, then?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","I'll consider myself duly warned."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","How about you keep it to yourself, Witch?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","Sensing trouble, says you? Let's kill it, says I."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Die dumb, die smart... it's all the same in the end."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","Ignorance is bliss, Big Man. Hold onto it while you have it."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","They'll come, Big Man. Just you wait and see."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Enjoy the breather. It won't last long."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","You're not fooling anybody here."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","Even a tiny bullet can find its mark. Pay attention!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Whatever gets you through the fight."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Optimism? Huh."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","Yeah, but your fists are big enough to choose."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","Give me a bullet over a punch any day."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","You can warm up when you reach the fires of Hel, Witch."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","The cold's the least of your worries, Witch."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","Be competent a little further away from me, Witch."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Few more months and you might be vaguely useful."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Enforcers do what they must."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","They are not known for their tolerance."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_a_01","We're all dead already. Make it count."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_a_02","Death's just round the corner. Let's ambush it!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_a_03","May as well die fighting. It's inevitable anyway."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","We live to die."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","I live as a Guard, I will die as a Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Perhaps they're just trying to get a word in edgeways?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","You could learn a trick or two about being quiet yourself."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","Ah yes, the mighty Nork Deddog. A great tale."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Nork Deddog. None finer."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","I've got your back this time, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","Look to your own defence. I'll look to mine."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","Hold the line, or you'll answer to me!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","Desertion ain't a joke, Soldier."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Shows how much you understand the real world."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","As always, it's down to the cogs to do the machine's work."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","How about you practice what you preach, Soldier?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","Any unit is only as good as its leader. Which means we're karked."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","You'd still run screaming if one landed at your feet."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Ain't no more reliable way to clear a path."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_a_01","The galaxy's sliding into hel. It'll take discipline and cold steel to change that."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_a_02","Focus. Steel. Discipline. Hel take us all otherwise."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_a_03","We're all that's between this place and Hel."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","In the Guard we trust."

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","I hear a good slap wakes you from a dream. Need a hand with that?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","How about trying reality on for size, Witch?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","There's a time and place for liquor and this ain't it."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","Drink numbs the senses. I'm out of both."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","The Emperor Protects. Except when he doesn't."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","I hope he's brought a rifle."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","I've seen the fall of a world. This one's not done yet."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","While we still stand, so does Atoma. Get to it, Soldier."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","Kill more, talk less. We all win."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","The pestilence has taken deep root for sure. Let's get to purging."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","War is just the respite before death."

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","In other news, water proven to be wet."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Chin up, Big Man. At least your feet are still attached."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Your feet don't stop you firing a gun, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","Can't deny it's effective. And impressive."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","That's all well and good until you're in a confined space."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Destroy the enemy. Rinse, repeat. You've got this, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Just shoot anything that ain't us. That'll do."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","Thanks for the encouraging words."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","To think I gave up a prison cell for this karking fancy-talk."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Don't get too attached."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You're passable, I suppose."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","You know you're basically disgusting, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Sounds... delicious."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","You don't like Poxwalkers? They say such good things about you."

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Don't worry about sharing the medicae. Oh, you're not. My mistake."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Save that medicae. We're gonna need it later."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","If your arm's not hanging off, don't waste healing on it!"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","I'm more use to you alive than dead."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","I'm injured. I needed healing. What's the issue?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","At least you have a home."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","I feel that, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","You know that you can offer your fealty silently, right?"

"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","Are you that desperate to die? Calm down, Priest."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","They'll come soon enough, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Your eagerness to die is duly noted."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","I think not."
"loc_veteran_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Can't be worse than the alternative."

"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_02_03","Cards plus our pilot equals karking cheating."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_02_04","Pilot suggested cards. Then cheated her way to winning."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","You win some, you lose some. Mostly, you lose."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Do you never learn?"

"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Probably with reason. Best advice is to steer clear."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","Morrow won't be angry without reason."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Leave him be. You don't want to cross someone who fought with Yarrick and that's the truth."

"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","Xanatros? You're kidding, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_03_01","Genestealers wiped out damn near three regiments and Space Marines to boot. And Morrow walked out."

"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_03_03","Let's say that genestealers were involved. A lot of genestealers. [Whistle] And Morrow survived."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_03_04","Out-lived three Mordian regiments and a host of genestealers. That's some story."

"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_01","Can't help but wonder how he walked out when so many didn't. Don't you?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_02","I wonder..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_03","If he walked out, I wonder who walked out with him?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_04","Tough old devil."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","I hear Morrow fought at Armageddon. He's too young, surely?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow's older than he looks. Heard he was at Hades Hive."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Hear tell his transport met a Warp storm. Time is only optional in those things."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Warp storms are involved. Anything's possible."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","No point in caring. He's in charge and that's how it is."
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Does it really matter?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","Tech-Priests are all a little weird, but our Tech-Priest more so."

"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","Maybe. Doesn't matter much."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_abhumans_four_c_01","There might be other types."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_abhumans_four_c_02","Only type that matters is Soldier or not."

"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","They make battle-tanks here, but you need trained crew."

"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_chaos_three_b_02","Such things shouldn't be said out loud."

"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_one_c_01","If I start speaking in ones and zeroes, put me down, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_one_c_02","She's probably the least of what we have to worry about."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I wouldn't go into that mind if I were you, Witch. Won't end well."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Just like a Witch to poke where they're not wanted."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_three_c_01","Witches. Can't trust any of them."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Ever thought of not being an interfering busybody?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Go on. Ask her for her age. I dare you."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Probably down to good anti-rust treatments."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_two_c_01","Old age is a luxury few of us enjoy in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hadron_two_c_02","She'll doubtless outlive us all."

"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_a_02","Glad the Commodore's on our side. She's... tough."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_a_03","The Commodore has a mind like a steel trap. And is just as lethal, I bet."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_a_04","Hallowette is tough and I respect that fully. My advice - don't cross her."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The purser? Something happen?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Seems everyone round here has a story. Spill the beans."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","She's got Brunt well and truly under her thumb."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","Heard her yelling at Rannick. I was pretending not to enjoy it."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Of course they're high. She's got a captive audience."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Have you tried not complaining and haggling instead?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","It's definitely a seller's market."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","We're just profit on legs to her eyes."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Don't really have an opinion."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Why do you care what I think anyway?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","She can clear a room with a single glare."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She'd slit your throat as soon as look at you."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Nobles, officials, and high born."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","The people in charge."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","In war, I'd take the lowborn every time."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","Living at the top makes you weak."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_01","Hives breed gangs like dung hatches flies..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_02","Hives grow, and gangs breed in the sump at the bottom."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_03","A hive isn't a hive without gangs."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_04","Hive gangs. Dregs of the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Best thing to do with gangs is to scoop them up and send them to a war zone."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Gangs are scum... but they can make effective soldiers."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Give them a lasgun and get them on the front lines."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","They're ruthless, merciless killers... fine material for the Astra Militarum."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Darkness, violence, and suffering - all of the Imperium is here."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Life on a war world makes this look soft."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Hives can kill you faster than a enemy strike force."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Every way to die - a Hive has them all."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","It's what the manufactorums make that matters - weapons and armour."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Industry only has one use - to supply armies."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","These factories won't be supplying armies for a generation at least."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","Once we win, it's going to take a lot to get this lot working."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Only thing a hero earns is their grave."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_four_c_02","No bell will toll for us."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_a_01","Holy Terra, the centre of all.  Ever wonder what's it like?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_a_02","Terra... Sometimes you've gotta wonder if it's even real, right?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_a_03","Any of you seen Terra?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_a_04","My one wish? To see Terra."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Terra's just a dream. Here and now, that's what's real."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_b_02","Terra is going to be like everywhere else - at war."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_c_01","We fight for Terra, nothing else matters."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Never going to see it this side of the grave."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_three_b_01","No tithe. No soldiers to protect any world."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_three_b_02","Flesh and blood, every world must give it or fall to enemies."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_three_c_01","The tithe is the price of survival."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_three_c_02","No tithe. No Imperium. No humanity. Simple."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_two_b_01","And every world's at war."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Every year more worlds burn. Lose enough battles and they'll soon be none."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_two_c_01","This rock we stand on right now's the only one that matters."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Cadia fell.  No one thought it could. What chance have the rest got?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","Never seen an Assassin. Never want to."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","Officio Assassinorum don't turn up for trouble like this."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","An assassin means that we're in far above our tithe grade."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","If they could've sent an assassin we'd not be here."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_01","Exterminatus - that's what's going to happen here. Count on it."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_02","Exterminatus... They are going to burn this place down to the bedrock."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_03","Exterminatus, that's what's coming."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_04","If it was me I'd have called in an Exterminatus already."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","Crack open the planet's skin like an egg shell. Whole place becomes ash."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Cyclonic torpedo from low orbit. Job done."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Could be they've given the order already. We'd never know."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","This place can burn now or later, makes no difference."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","Inquisitors are above the law. Us... were just breaking it by order."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Law can protect traitors. Someone needs to judge them."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","There is no law in places like this anyway."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","War has no laws."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","It gives... purpose, and that's enough."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Killing traitors? No higher honour."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","The Ordo doesn't matter. Just the mission."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","If the enemy burns, I don't care who tells me to set the blaze."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","It's a mystery."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","It works. That's all we know."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Do you think any of us really have the first clue about any of it?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","I am a soldier. Holy mysteries are for others."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_a_01","Solar Macharius... need a soldier like that now."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_a_03","Macharius... pushed back the darkness and died on campaign. That's a soldier."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_a_04","More leaders like Solar Macharius and we wouldn't be in this mess."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","Soldier and saint. A true hero."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","And now he watches over true soldiers as a saint."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","Killed by a traitor. That tells us something."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","How he died doesn't matter, only how he fought."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Ignorance is a blessing."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","Better ignorant than weakened by knowledge."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","The past is dead. The fight here and now is all that matters."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","If the past can help us fight now, then good. Otherwise it's dead and gone."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","One man almost killed the Imperium. Dark times."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","Blood and madness, that's what I heard it was."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Justice came for Vandire in the end. Like it does for all traitors."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Vandire was cut down in his lair. A just end."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_four_b_01","Aren't we all loyal servants?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_four_b_02","Loyalty goes a long way in a set-up like this."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_four_c_01","Someone that straight-laced is up to something."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_four_c_02","Bureaucrats. You know one, you know them all."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_a_01","Melk's a bureaucrat's bureaucrat, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_a_02","That karking obnoxious Melk is heading for a black eye."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_a_03","Melk ain't even trying my patience, he's used it all up."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_a_04","If you look up 'sycophant', you'll find Melk."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_b_01","Oh. His most righteous nobleness-ness-ness, Lord Darius Melk?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_b_02","He doesn't like you calling him by the short version. Lord Sir Darius Melk von Melkenheim the Third or something."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_c_01","Right. I'll remember that."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_one_c_02","Someone drop a bag of titles on him?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_three_b_01","Even when he says 'good morning' he sounds like he regrets letting that slip."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_three_b_02","He's like others of his kind. Too tied by the rules to engage with the living."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_three_c_01","He's just another oddly shaped piece in this puzzle."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_three_c_02","He probably just wants to get back to his paperwork."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_two_b_01","[Laugh] He knows precisely how to press your buttons, doesn't he?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_two_b_02","A pitched battle to see who's most pretentious in the offing?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_two_c_01","Let it go, Priest. Words don't win a face-to-face fight."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_melk_two_c_02","[Snort of laughter]"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_four_b_01","The thought of that is making my brain itch."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_four_b_02","And he's still alive? Most would've been put out their misery by now."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Part organic, part metal? That's... unpleasant."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_four_c_02","No wonder he's always in a foul mood."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_a_01","I did hear tell that Morrow fought at Badab against Ol' Slobberchops Blackheart."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_a_02","Morrow fought in the Badab War. Stuff of legends, that."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_a_03","So Morrow's come up against Chaos plenty of times - including against the Red Corsairs in the Badab War."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_a_04","I heard Morrow was in the Badab War. Wonder if came up against Huron Blackheart?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_b_01","He was? Those were some dark times."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Is this another 'Morrow was everywhere' tales?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Badab was then. This is now. Let's hope he's here in the present."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Some of these stories about Morrow beggar belief."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_three_b_01","A good soldier births their own legends. Morrow's no exception."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_three_b_02","A little bit of spin on the truth builds morale."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_three_c_01","It could all be lies. Frankly, I don't care."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_three_c_02","Stories mean less than deeds. Let's see what he can do."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_two_b_01","No way is he old enough to have been at Macragge."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Really? You'll be telling me next he was there the day the Emperor slew Horus."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Morrow's invincible AND immortal, huh?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_morrow_two_c_02","How come I didn't hear of him before now if he's done all this stuff?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","The Mourningstar's compact - but she's deadly."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","As ships go, she'll do."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","She's not like any other ship I've seen."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","The Captain runs her well and that's good enough for me."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Rannick? Why should he go die when he's got others to do that for him?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Watching from a safe distance is a luxury of command."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Leave him to do his thing, we do ours. Just... we do it better."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_four_c_02","I'm a soldier. The front line is where I belong."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_a_01","Can't make head nor tail of Rannick."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_a_02","Every time Rannick looks at me, I feel I'm getting sized up."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_a_03","What do you think of Rannick? Can't get under that skin at all."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_a_04","Rannick looks at me like a ship looks at a Warp storm."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_b_01","I think too much attention from him would be a bad thing."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_b_02","Don't try getting close, he'll hit you with his Inquisitorial Seal."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Follow the chain of command and just do what he says."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_one_c_02","Don't like him. Doesn't mean I won't follow orders."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_three_b_01","I'm sorry, do I look like I care what Rannick's future holds?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Grendyl's successor-in-waiting, perhaps."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_three_c_01","A man with ambition is a man to watch. Very carefully."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_three_c_02","His final destination is none of my concern."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Perhaps he just keeps the faith quietly."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Rannick's faith is between him and the Emperor, not you."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_two_c_01","If you want to take it up with him, be my guest."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_rannick_two_c_02","Talk to him about it. Just leave me out of it."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_a_01","Servitors have their place. Preferably wherever I am not."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_a_02","They might be unnerving, but without servitors, the Imperium would grind to a halt."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_a_03","There are a lot of servitors on the Mourningstar, aren't there?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_a_04","The servitors keep things moving, sure. Doesn't stop them creeping me out."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Proof of life beyond death that I'd rather not be aware of."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_b_02","Tools. No more, no less."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_c_01","We each serve in our own way."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_servitors_one_c_02","I can't imagine that sort of existence - if it even is one."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","They are the Emperor's Angels. He made them to destroy his enemies."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","They are, and that's all that matters."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Ancient power and mysteries run in their blood."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","Armour, gene-craft, ancient weapons - that's what makes them His Angels."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_01","Space Marines, that what this situation requires."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_02","Only one real way to clean this up - the Angels of Death."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_03","Space Marines could go through this in hours."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_04","This is a Space Marine level of threat."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","The Angels of Death aren't coming to help us."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","Adeptus Astartes won't get involved. These days you need a bigger mess than this."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Space Marines bring death, not salvation."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","If they come, I hope they send the Ultramarines or the Silver Skulls."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","Even if it's true, he's a long way from here..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","True or not, makes not difference here and now."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Believe it's true, believe it's false, means nothing."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Even if a son of the Emperor has returned, it's not going to help this sump hole of a world."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","I have never had the chance to read such a holy text."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Soldiers in the Guard don't get to read the words of the Emperor's sons."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Right now, a fresh reload would be more use than a book."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Books and ideas are less important than guns and bullets."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","He's a warrior, armoured and armed."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","We could not even look at Him to find out."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","We die, we get to find out."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","Don't need to see the Golden Throne to serve it."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_a_03","Sometimes I hear the Emperor's voice in the sound of battle..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_a_04","The Emperor speaks, but does anyone hear his voice?"
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","You can hear Him everywhere. He roars like gunfire."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He speaks to Soldiers all the time - sounds just like your sergeant's orders."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","His will's clear, no matter what - kill the enemy."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","He's a God. His will's not for us to understand, only to obey."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Dead witches... no bad thing."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","Small price to pay."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","It's not kind, but nothing in this universe is."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","Everyone dies. At least those psykers die with purpose."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","He's fighting forever. At least we get to die."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","His sacrifice is an example to us all."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","He will endure, and so must we."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","We're not meant to understand Him. We obey. That's our job."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","I don't know and I don't want to know."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Don't know how it works, just that it does."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","No matter how it works, just be glad when it does..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Witches and mutants. It all comes down to witches and mutants."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_warp_one_a_01","I never sleep in Warp travel. Things try to get into your dreams..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_warp_one_a_02","Warp travel is like swimming in bad dreams..."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_the_warp_one_a_03","Hate Warp travel. You... see things at the edge of your eyes."

"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_xenos_three_b_02","Xenos can help us fight us, but in the end we'll stand alone."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_xenos_three_c_01","Weapons are only as good as the flesh and bone behind them."

"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_zola_one_a_04","Zola may seem cold and heartless, but I don't think that's the case."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_zola_one_b_01","War's no place to show heart."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_zola_one_b_02","I bet she'd open up after an amasec or two."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_zola_one_c_01","She has goals and goes straight for them."
"loc_veteran_female_c__lore_zola_one_c_02","As long as keeping a stone face doesn't cause her to crack."

"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_confess_c_01","[Sigh] That's a real weight off my mind. Don't want to die dragged down by ... all that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_confess_e_01","I know my business ... but ... thanks."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_a_01","You know what? You’re a good soldier, Big Man. Proud to serve with you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_c_01","Erm … No ta. No offence, but I’ve seen what you eat. Don’t know how you keep it down."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_e_01","Still … I’ll take your word for it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_two_a_01","You were wasted as an enforcer. The Guard could have used you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_two_c_01","Found you anyway didn’t it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_two_e_01","Ain’t nobody listen if they did, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_ogr_b_b_01","That's how it's done, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_ogr_b_d_01","Well, each to their own, I guess."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_vet_c_b_01","Good enough to impress you? I'll take that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_vet_c_d_01","Not sure I fancy being any of those things."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_zea_c_b_01","I thank the Throne for this kill!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_01_a_01","Takes more than a flesh wound to keep you down, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_01_c_01","Yeah. But stay close 'till you get your breath back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_02_a_01","Copped a proper wallop back there, didn't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_02_c_01","Damn straight. ... Ready to show these scum how a soldier fights?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_03_a_01","Hey, hey, hey ... Take it easy a moment. They got you good."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_03_c_01","Never was one for watching. You call the target, I'll back you up."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_04_a_01","Not gonna lie - I'm surprised you're still walking after that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_04_c_01","Just as well, because you look about ready to fold."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_05_b_01","Takes more than that to stop me. Just give me a moment."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_05_d_01","Obliged to you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_06_b_01","If we get back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_06_d_01","Yes ma'am. Sorry ma'am. Ow."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_07_b_01","No - ow! - No, I'm fine. Thanks for asking."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_07_d_01","Easy - ow! - for you to say. Wasn't your lung."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_08_b_01","Not me. I'm not done for yet."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_08_d_01","You've got a point ... keep an eye out for a med station, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_09_a_01","Finally clipped your wings, did they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_09_c_01","Counting on it, I am. Ready to get stuck back in?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_10_a_01","I thought you were invincible."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_10_c_01","Yeah? Whatever you say."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_11_a_01","You're gonna want to get that wound looked at."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_11_c_01","Can't have a scar if you don't keep the leg."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_12_a_01","Should've ducked."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_12_c_01","How about ""Should've ducked, you fragging idiot""?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_13_b_01","I ain't done for yet, just you wait."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_13_d_01","Funny guy. Dead funny."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_14_b_01","I've felt better, no word of a lie."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_14_d_01","You're all heart."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_15_b_01","Nothing I want to repeat."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_15_d_01","I'll manage, thanks."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_16_b_01","All things being equal, I'd rather I didn't have to."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_16_d_01","Can't argue with that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_killstreak_extension_vet_a_psy_b_c_01","We'll make a soldier of you yet."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_killstreak_extension_vet_a_psy_b_e_01","Erm, well ... Just keep doing what you're doing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_killstreak_extension_vet_a_vet_b_c_01","I reckon you've been practicing [Sotto] ... finally."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_killstreak_extension_vet_a_zea_a_c_01","I'm just glad you're on our side. I mean ... you are, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_lasgun_a_01","You know what I'd like?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_lasgun_c_01","Some proper armour. You know, like those Tempestus Scions have."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_leman_russ_a_01","They say the Leman Russ is the workhorse of the Imperial Guard, but you can't go wrong with a lasgun."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_leman_russ_c_01","And them who complain ain't using it right. Right?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aiming_a_01","If you're wanting to serve the Emperor, you might want to practise your aim. You're forever hitting armour."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aiming_c_01","When we get done with this, look me up. I'll give you some pointers ... just in case the Emperor's message ain't getting through."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_another_day_a_01","You got any movement over there?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_another_day_c_01","About the same. For the moment. You know how it goes: it's all quiet, then something tries to kill you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_another_day_e_01","Just another day in the fragging Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_attitude_a_01","Listen, I still think your attitude stinks, but you're a handy lass to have around in a tight spot."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_attitude_c_01","Oh, and you've got a foul mouth on you too."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_bombs_a_01","It's a sorry state down here. Don't see it getting better until the war's over."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_bombs_c_01","Don't talk like that, please. Not while we're still down here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_challenges_a_01","So, the Emperor ... he really is watching over us, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_challenges_c_01","Never seems to watch out for me all that much."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_challenges_e_01","Well, never let it be said I back down when things got tough."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_chance_b_01","Too early to tell, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_chance_d_01","Chance'd be a fine thing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_charm_b_01","Good luck with that. She don't much listen."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_charm_d_01","Oi! I'm charming. I just ... get nervous stairing into that metal death mask of hers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_come_play_b_01","Will you stop that? You're going to bring the whole hive down on us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_come_play_d_01","My point is that there's only a handful of us and thousands of them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_come_play_f_01","You're going to be the death of me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_commissar_b_01","I was not. Anyway, you can't suck up to commissars. They're made of stone."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_commissar_d_01","Leave it out. I respect authority, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_commissar_f_01","[Sigh]"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_comrades_a_01","Now, I like having the Emperor in my corner - never let it be said that I don't - but there's nothing better than a reliable strike team."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_comrades_c_01","Yeah, I know. But it's war, ain't it? Can't rely on having what you need, only on what the brass can be bothered to give you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_destiny_a_01","Try to sharpen up, would you? I promised Zola I'd make something of this team."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_destiny_c_01","Destiny."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_a_01","Don't know where you get your energy, if I'm honest. I'm knackered."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_c_01","And did he?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_e_01","That's a resounding ""yes"" then, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_faith_a_01","Look, I know I give you a hard time, but I'm glad you're with me. Holy wars call for holy warriors, you know?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_faith_c_01","Aye, the Emperor Protects."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_faith_e_01","Now you're talking my language!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friendly_fire_a_01","Heretics still haven't got the message, have they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friendly_fire_c_01","You'd really shoot me in the back for not sharing ammo?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fury_b_01","Wouldn't know about that. I just shoot things. In the face, for preference."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fury_d_01","The damn Emperor, that's who ... Wait, I see what you mean."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grenades_a_01","I wish they'd let me bring more grenades, but no. "
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grenades_c_01","Seeing the state of some of the other teams, I don't blame 'em for that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_homesick_b_01","Will you cut that out? I don't want to talk about the past. I just want to kill heretics, got it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_homesick_d_01","I said I don't want to talk about it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_immortal_a_01","What's your problem anyway? You got a death wish?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_immortal_c_01","You what? How do you reckon that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_immortal_e_01","All right then, that's me told. "
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_irony_a_01","Still can't believe I haven't bought it down here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_irony_c_01","Don't say things like that out loud."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leaders_b_01","Can't argue there, but I ain't rightly sure we've got the numbers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leaders_d_01","You might be onto something there. Might be worth talking to Zola."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leave_b_01","What? This is war! No time for idlers and slack-timers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leave_d_01","Yeah. Life's exciting enough down here. We need folk we can rely on, and that's the truth."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_modicum_b_01","You're in a good mood."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_modicum_d_01","A modicum? We've been up to our necks in scum since the drop."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_modicum_f_01","Ah. I see what you mean."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_optimism_a_01","I've got a bad feeling about this drop."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_optimism_c_01","No need to be sarky ... or are you telling me that you don't feel it too?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_politics_b_01","Politics ain't my thing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_politics_d_01","Well, that's gonna be something to look forward to."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_quarrel_a_01","What's this I hear about you quarreling with one of the Zealots?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_quarrel_c_01","I ain't asking a lady though, am I?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rats_a_01","You've got my back and I've got yours. The way it should be."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rats_c_01","The cage is still there, mind. It's just that we're on a leash now."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_restoration_b_01","Aye, that's the dream. Death's coming for us all, but we can make it count."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_restoration_d_01","Can't argue with that. Tell you what, you watch my back and I'll watch yours. Might be we get out of this in one piece."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trusted_b_01","I'm still in the Guard. Just on secondment, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trusted_d_01","There you go, quibbling again. I'm a trusted member of this warband, I am."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_worse_b_01","Could be going worse, and all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_worse_d_01","That's life in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wounds_b_01","Ah, it's an old injury. Medicae servitor didn't set a bone right. It plays up now and then."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wounds_d_01","Yeah, I've had about as much clarity as I can take for one lifetime."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_mouthy_a_01","You'd better watch your mouth when you're talking about the Emperor."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_mouthy_c_01","Because I'll shoot you myself. Got it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_candles_b_01","... might be, but only a little. Then again, I bet it's a good way to relieve frustations."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_candles_d_01","Now it's starting to sound a bit ... perverse."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_coconut_a_01","Any of you ever heard of the Catachan coconut? Nasty thing. Looks like a skull, and if you get too close it bursts open with hundreds of tiny envenomed stingers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_coconut_c_01","Reminds me of Morrow, that's all. Dangerous from a distance, worse close up."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_coconut_e_01","Well now, you can go too far you know ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_fascination_a_01","I admit, it's good to have a Psyker about ... now and then."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_fascination_c_01","No! Wait! I didn't say that!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_firezone_a_01","Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm Big Man, but stay clear of the fire zone."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_firezone_c_01","I mean ""where I'm shooting""."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_grey_b_01","Yeah? Ain't as though there's much of a life without duty, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_grey_d_01","Keeps me going. That's what matters."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_intheway_a_01","Oi, Big Man ... You keep getting in the way of my shots!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_intheway_c_01","Just stay out of my way, all right?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_lecture_b_01","Here it comes. Another hoity-toity lecture."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_lecture_d_01","Oh, don't take on. I don't hate you ... it's just that you always make me feel a bit--"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_lecture_f_01","Angry. You make me feel angry."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_old_days_b_01","What? Like latrine duty, trench warfare, lazy sergeants ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_old_days_d_01","Yeah, takes me back. We ain't so bad off being here after all, are we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_polish_b_01","Nothing wrong with my attitude. Polished it over a long and glorious career, I have."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_polish_d_01","I've shirked with the best of them, from Cadia to Xanatros. I tell you, most of being in the Guard's just keeping your head down and waiting for someone else to sort it out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_polish_f_01","I can't help that. Some of us just have a gift, you know? And lots of raw charisma."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_willpower_a_01","Can't fault your energy, Big Man. Nothing seems to get you down."
"loc_veteran_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_willpower_c_01","You've been listening to those Psykers again, haven't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__calling_for_help_01","Help!"

"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_gas_b_01","Yeah, it ain't pretty, Big Man. But like usual, we just have to put up with it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_gas_b_02","It ain't exactly easy on the lungs, and that's a fact."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_01","Always thinking with your stomach, ain't you Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_02","A good soldier always knows where his next meal's coming from."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_01","Just makes things interesting, if you ask me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_02","Yeah, but they can't fragging see us, can they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_01","Still got fragging big teeth, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_02","Don't need training when they've got teeth like that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_a_01","Well, at least this muck ain't poisonous."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_a_02","Could be worse. This fog could be stripping the flesh off our bones."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_01","Yeah, I've seen that before. From a distance, thankfully."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_02","True enough. Maybe the Emperor does love us after all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_a_01","I hate being chased by Hounds. It's so ... undignified."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_a_02","Hounds. It's always fragging Hounds?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_01","I hear you. We work together and we'll get through this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_02","We've got the training. That's what counts."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_01","Quit moaning and get your weapon up! The heretics could be anywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_02","You don't get to choose your battlefield. Or your grave."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_01","There's someone else who likes the sound of their own voice a bit much too. I wonder who I mean ... ?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_02","Something else is barking ... Oh, it's you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_01_b_01","Sure is, but I'm not in this life to stay clear of danger."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_04_b_01","I reckon so, Big Man. You do good work."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_08_b_01","Into as many pieces as you can, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_09_b_01","You're kind of hard to miss."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_15_b_01","Don't we all? No good comes of questioning your betters."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_19_b_01","Just follow my lead, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_02_b_01","It's the only language they understand, true enough."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_03_b_01","Can't argue with that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_05_b_01","There'll be a challenge along soon enough, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_13_b_01","Patience, Big Man. There's plenty yet to be done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_17_b_01","When you're right, you're right."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_19_b_01","Aye, it's a big part of your charm."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_02_b_01","Like the kind that don't send us to certain death?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_03_b_01","What do you think we've been doing, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_05_b_01","Erm... What exactly you been eating, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_13_b_01","I envy you, Big Man. You don't think about the scars on the inside."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_17_b_01","Yes. Yes you are."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_19_b_01","Yeah... It's the bits inbetween that make things complicated."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_03_b_01","Oi! There's nothing wrong with being a soldier!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_06_b_01","It wasn't always this way. You want to blame someone, blame the heretics."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_b_01","It's easy enough to settle into a pattern, ain't it? The screams provide rhythm."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_b_01","Can't argue with that. I prefer a straight fight."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_15_b_01","Oh, I'm sure it'll liven up soon enough."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_18_b_01","Reckon you're in charge, do you? Not while I'm breathing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_03_b_01","Oh, for Throne's sake! This is real!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_06_b_01","If that really is the Emperor you're talking to, you'd do well to listen."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_b_01","Would a nice, hard slap help?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_12_b_01","Like I keep telling you: you're not asleep!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_15_b_01","Hard core violence: best therapy going."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_18_b_01","Way ahead of you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_06_b_01","They aren't better than us. Not if this mess went down on their watch."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_b_01","That's a luxury. They should try getting deployed to a different world every few weeks."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_b_01","Caring is a luxury we can't afford. Everyone here is under suspicion."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_b_01","You know, Witch, there'll come a time when our orders and the Lex don't play nice together..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_18_b_01","We got more than that. We got orders. Understand?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_01_a_01","Right cosy little place this. Who the Hel lives here by choice?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_a_01","The sights on this gun are off. I can feel it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_b_01","Yeah, substandard clobber left, right and centre. It's a fragging joke."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_03_a_01","Stay together! We're stronger as a team."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_03_b_01","Damn straight! Numbers matter. Discipline matters!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_04_a_01","You lot stick with me, and I'll get you through this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_a_01","Well, this could be going worse. Could be going better, mind."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_b_01","Just another fragging day in the Guard ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_06_a_01","Keep your eyes open. I don't want any nasty surprises."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_a_01","Keep up the pace! We're not done yet."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_08_a_01","No stragglers now! Let's get this done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_a_01","If this is life in a hive city, I'll stick with the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_10_a_01","Throne! Look at the state of all this. Breaks my heart."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_11_a_01","Don't get sloppy! I'm not dragging you back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_12_a_01","Not one of my better days. Just as well no one's keeping score."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_a_01","There'll be more coming, so stay fragging alert!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_b_01","Copy that!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_14_a_01","I'll make soldiers of you lot yet ... assuming you live that long."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_15_a_01","You lot wouldn't last long in the Guard. Then again, most folk don't."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_16_a_01","Oh, this brings back memories. None of them good."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_17_a_01","Can you lot not make less noise? Fragging amateurs."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_17_b_01","Damn right. Let's show a bit of discipline, shall we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_18_a_01","Do me a favour? Keep your heads in the next fire fight."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_19_a_01","Watch your aim, yeah? I've enough problems without fetching a bullet in the back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_19_b_01","A terrible thing, getting shot by your own side."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_20_a_01","You lot need more discipline. That's what wins wars."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_03_a_01","You do know we're all gonna die here, don't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_04_a_01","Well, this is fun."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_b_01","Less moaning, yeah? Set an example."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_b_01","And you. I've certainly had worse folk watching my back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_17_b_01","Nothing wrong with that. Keeps you alert."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_19_b_01","There's nothing beats the feel of a bayonet sliding between a heretic's ribs."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_b_01","Got a fine opinion of yourself, don't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_b_01","Good advice. I hope the others are listening."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_17_b_01","Aye. Stay close comrades. Let's get this done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_19_b_01","A soldier without hope's already dead."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_06_b_01","Aye. Kick them slackers to the kerb."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_11_b_01","Too bloody right! We fight for the fragging Throne!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_12_b_01","Blessed be the Emperor!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_12_b_02","We serve the Throne, and in service, find purpose!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_18_b_01","Ain't it just? Good thing that faith will see us through!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_06_b_01","Aye, anger'll see you through dark days, especially with the Emperor at your side."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_11_b_01","That we will. Just gotta keeping fighting, comrade!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_12_b_01","And very glad of it I am."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_12_b_02","Praise the Throne! May the Light of Terra guide us!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_18_b_01","Ah ... There you and I will have to part company. Medicae exists for a reason."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_05_b_01","Yeah... But good rations and few extra credits wouldn't go amiss."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_10_b_01","Great! Mine must be white as a fragging Valhallan winter."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_11_b_01","I'll be happy to go down fighting, and let the Emperor judge."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_17_b_01","Not in any department."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Stay alert! We're not out of this yet!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_02","Keep your fragging eyes open!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_03","Stay together! Let's get this mission done!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Keep moving! Let's make Morrow proud!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_05","Watch the shadows! There could be anything out there!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Eyes open, comrades!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_07","We're making good progress!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_08","Work as a team!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_09","Don't give the heretics a fragging inch!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Stick with me and we'll get through this!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","Would you prefer ""Homo Sapiens Gigantus""?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","It's cos you're different. You know, like a Ratling, only the exact opposite."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_a_01","Right. Remember to make your shots count."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_a_02","Get your sights on the target before you pull the trigger."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_a_03","None of this spray and pray, stuff. Make sure you aim, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","Always do."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","Your lips to my ears."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","Maybe you should learn something I like to call 'fire discipline'?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","Pick your targets. It'll last longer."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Will you quit stealing all the ammo?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Oi! The rest of us need some fragging ammo as well, you know!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Did you just take the fragging ammo? Again?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","You'd only misuse it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Don't you tell me what to do!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Just remember who the enemy is, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","Save it for the heretics, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Can't say I disagree. Stay alert."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","You might be right. Let's keep our eyes open."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Reckon you're doing just fine as you are."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","You don't need it, Big Man. You're plenty smart."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Give it time, Big Man. They'll be back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Rest easy, Big Man. This ain't over."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Alright, alright. No need to go showing off."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","No one likes a show-off, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Don't jinx it, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Awww... Why'd you have to say that out loud?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","Glad you take such [ahem] pride in your work, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","I'll stick to the guns, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","It isn't. Now quit your whining."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","You don't know cold until a Commissar looks you dead in the eye."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","You never know, we'll make a soldier of you yet!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","You're getting better, I'll give you that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Tolerance is what got us into this mess."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Looks like they turned a blind eye once too often."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","That's not the Guard spirit. Never say die!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","All the Emperor can ask is that we die fighting!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Stay creepy, comrade. Wouldn't be the same, else."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Oh, the Psyker's off again..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","Heard he saved the lives of over a hundred officers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Most famous bodyguard in the Astra Militarum."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","I'll do what I can, but no promises."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","You talk like that's a small thing, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","Not me. I know my duty."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","You stay put. We've a fragging job to do."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Takes the Guard a while to get moving, you know that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","That's the Astra Militarum for you. Starts slow, stops slow, grinds everything to powder."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_a_01","Next time we engage, try to fight like soldiers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_a_02","I want to see some proper soldiering from here on out, understand?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_a_03","When the next skirmish starts, you follow my lead. Like soldiers. Got it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","Understood."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","Copy that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","Look, a nice big bang just happens to be a great leveller, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Can't go wrong with a pocket-sized explosion."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Bit of faith and steel, that's how we do it in the Guard, eh!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Spoken like a proper soldier. Let's get to work!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","Best not to think about it, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Just focus on the enemy, that's my advice."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Pull yourself together. We need you sober."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","This ain't the time for drinking, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_a_01","It'll be hard fighting before we're done, but the Emperor stands with us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_a_02","Trust to the Emperor, comrades. He'll see us to victory."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_a_03","It may be bitter work, but at least the Emperor's with us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","True enough. May he always be our shield."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","The Emperor Protects."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","Watch your mouth. Don't do any good to say such things."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","If that's all you can say, keep it zipped."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","You know how it goes, once the rot sets in, it gets fragging everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Breaks my heart, it does. So let's break some heads."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","Long as I've ammo and a reliable gun, bring it on."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","That's life in the Guard. Fix bayonets and meet it with steel."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","Heh. Welcome to life in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","Never known anything different. It's a challenge to rise above."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Never mind, Big Man. Could be worse."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Doesn't stop you fighting though, does it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","It's good for clearing trench lines, I know that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Aye. It's like the Emperor's wrath given form. Glorious."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Oh for-- Doesn't matter, Big Man. You're doing great."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Just follow my lead and keep shooting."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","You're not wrong. Best not to think about it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","Above my pay grade, all that. Thank frag."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","It's good to have friends when you're under fire."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You know how it goes, the Guard stands together!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Really putting the ""ab"" in ""abhuman"" there, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","If the enemy don't get you, your lunch sure will."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","Best we can do is put them out of their misery."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","We should put as many down as we can. It's a kindness."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Hang on, hang on! Don't go squandering that medicae!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Oi! Don't go wasting that healing!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","No! Don't waste that fragging healing!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Settle down. Wound was deeper than it looked, weren't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","You'd rather carry me back to the Mourningstar, would you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","You'll get used to it. Everyone does, sooner or later."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Ah, it's not so bad. At least the air's clean. Ish. Sometimes."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","If you think it'll help…"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","All right. You go high, I'll go low."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Be careful what you wish for."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","They'll be back, you wait."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","I'd enjoy the breather, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Don't worry. They'll be back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Don't take this wrong, Big Man, but ... eh ... no."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","It's healthy to have aspirations, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","Aye, and look what good it's done them!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Pity we couldn't have come in better circumstances."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","Whatever you say. Just so long as you keep fighting."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Oh no, who set the Witch off again?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","Won't catch me arguing with that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","Aye, for the fragging Throne!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","I could use a bit of festivity right now, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Pity the corrupt outnumber the faithful."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","No offence, but Psykers ain't exactly the most stable of folk."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","Have you tried being better company? That'd make it easier."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_a_01","Tertium's a grand old lady. She don't deserve this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_a_02","Shame to see Tertium like this. She deserves better."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_a_03","Tertium's another of the Emperor's great works, brought to ruin. Poor lass."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","It's a fragging tragedy, it is."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Got my blood boiling, seeing it like this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","And who's gonna carry the ammo? Not me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Ain't in the regs though, is it? Gotta follow the regs."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","What's wrong with this? Looks good and sturdy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","Don't tell me you're scared of elevators?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","Should fragging hope so, 'cos the pay isn't great."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","Hope he's watching our backs right now."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","Always pays to stay on the Emperor's good side."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","I'm very much thankful to still be alive…"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Gladly, but let's be sure it's as quiet as it seems."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Later, Priest. This won't last."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Just how it is, Big Man. Don't worry about it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Can't all be the same, can we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_a_01","Can't shift the taste of those combat rations, even through a mouthful of blood."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_a_02","Can you believe the state of the rations they've got us on?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_a_03","Keep an eye open for grub, comrades. Anything's better than those rations Morrow doles out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Rotten food, rotten orders. Nothing changes."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Those rations are the reason the army keeps marching. To get away from them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","You stay out of my head, Witch!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","And you might get shot."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Woah, Big Man. I don't think that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","That ain't what I think. Not at all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","Maybe let's get on with winning the war before spinning fantasies like that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","Sounds nice, but it's gonna be a long road before we get there."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","You want to put your feet up while there's a world in the balance?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","Yeah, I'm sure the heretics are taking time off too."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","You keep your fragging mouth shut."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Not this again. Keep it stowed."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Not again. Can't you stay awake, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Come on, no dawdling on the job, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Can't expect proper soldiering from heretics, can you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Ain't an ounce of courage in a heretic. Not one."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","I'm right behind you, Priest!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Too fragging right!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","With you lot in tow? Fat chance."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","No offence, but I don't think you're up to it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","What did you expect? It's hard work down here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","Sorry about that. Left my perfume back on the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Not sure they make them in your size, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","Ain't rightly sure that's a good idea."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Maybe they can restore it when we're done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","Once, maybe. Bit past her prime these days."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","There's definitely something in that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","Listen to that. Out of the mouths of innocents and untrustworthy mutants ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","There's no understanding scum."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","Heretic scum! Turning aside from the Emperor's Light."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Really? I had a similar experience with a provost."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","Law's just there to keep a body down. Always has been."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","Black marketeering? You're a disgrace to the uniform."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","You can pack that in. Conduct unbecoming, you know."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","You're starting to sound like a fragging Commissar."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","You're only as strong as the soldier next to you. Remember that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","You got real trust issues, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","I miss the old Guard days, when you could trust a fellow soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_a_01","Don't suppose you lot fancy behaving like real soldiers?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_a_02","You lot wouldn't last a day in the Guard, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_a_03","You know? You're a sloppy fragging bunch of fighters."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Says you. It's like looking in a mirror."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","Me? That's rich. Look at you!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_c_01","We're all going to die, ain't we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_c_02","And suddenly this feels like a suicide mission."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_c_03","Nice chat. Nice fragging chat."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_a_01","I know it looks bad, but we're not losing this world."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_a_02","Atoma ain't lost, not while I've got anything to do with it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_a_03","We're gonna throw the heretics outta this place. You'll see."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Damn straight. You can't stop the Astra-fragging-Militarum."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","Ain't that the glorious truth?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_a_01","You know, you lot should keep your weapons in better nick."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_a_02","Don't think I haven't seen the state of your weapons. You should be ashamed."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_a_03","You lot should be up on charges for the state of your weapons."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Speak for yourself. Mine are parade ground ready."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","Oh, hello Mister Kettle. I think you've got us confused."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","I… I'd rather not go there. Not yet."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","I think I'll keep that between me and the Emperor, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","You'll not find me wanting!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","For the Golden fragging Throne!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","Doesn't look that bad to me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","Huh, I've had worse."
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_01","Fragging hel, get back 'ere!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_02","Oi! Where're you goin'?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_03","Get back here, soldier!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_04","Get your worthless arse back here!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_05","Squad up, or you'll answer to me!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_06","Come 'ere! Right now!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_07","Stick together, numbskull!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_08","Stay close or die, simple as that!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_09","Don't fragging run off!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__come_back_to_squad_10","Where d'you think you're going?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","Where's the fragging Space Marines? This a job for them, not us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","It's like I'm back in the Guard. Alone in the dark until the enemy open fire..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","Heard an officer talking about something called the Cicatrix Maledictum earlier on. What's all that about then?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","Yeah. Clear as Frekkian mud."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","Wonder how the war's going? That weren't thunder you heard last night, but the 101st's artillery giving 'em hel."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","Never seen a hive city in one piece like this. They're normally in ruins by the time the Guard get called in."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","I keep hearing whispers of a second hive city, out there in the wastes. Anything in that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","It's a tough fragger ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","Pour it on! it's gotta die sometime!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Get behind it! Shoot it in the back!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Attack the rear! Go for the weak point!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","I hear you!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Now that's a good fragging idea!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","So ... What do you think about Explicator Zola?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Not sure what I think about the explicator ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","She's an odd one. Military, but not military. Could be trouble."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She's not someone I want to cross. Let's put it that way."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","Just try not to get on her bad side, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","I wouldn't pick a fight with her, and that's the fragging truth."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Picked up a rumour ... says Zola came from Atoma. Originally, I mean."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","I heard a thing ... Turns out our explicator's an Atoman native."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Question is, did she leave willingly, or was she on the run?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Everyone's got to be from somewhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Really? Always figured her for a woman with hidden shallows."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Hang on ... That sounds like praise."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Well ... You know drop-jockeys, need every favour they can get."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","I guess ... Well, I've never heard of anyone forging relics for filthy profit, not me!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","What do you make of our pilot? Seems a bit lippy to me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","That pilot's a character, isn't she? Needs a good dose of discipline."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I reckon we could do much worse. At least she's sober ... I think."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","Drop-jockeys are all the same. Reckon they're the Emperor's gift to us dirt pounders."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Well, we're stuck with her unless Rannick says otherwise."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Maybe I'd better familiarise myself with the Storm Raptor, just in case ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","Probably won't, no."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Is that so?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","What, Brunt? That ornery Catachan? You're right, I don't believe it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","A likely story. Brunt's twice her size."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","What's eating you, then?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","You've got a face like a kicked scav-rat. What's going on?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_02_01","Do yourself a favour - don't play Darktown tarot with that pilot of ours."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_02_02","Fragging pilot! Shouldn't be allowed near a tarot deck!"

"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_02_04","That fragging pilot talked me into a game of Darktown tarot."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Oh, here we go."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Oh no, not this again."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_01","Fragging cheats, doesn't she? No one's that lucky."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_02","Never seen cards dance like that, and always to her favour."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_03","Look, she fragging cheats! It's not my fault!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_04_04","Took me for every scrap of chit. Lucky to keep my damn uniform!"

"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Whatever you say!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","Old soldiers have old ghosts. Nothing strange about that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","We've all buried old comrades. Part of the life. Of course, it's better to leave them in the past."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","He'll hold it together. It's us I'm worried about."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","Don't you worry about Morrow. Steel Legionnaires don't know how to quit."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","It is me, or is the sergeant-major more short-tempered than most?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","The sarge seems to be burning on a short fuse ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Morrow's all right. Walks and talks mean, but he's fair."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","It's all front. Always is with his sort. There's a manufactorum somewhere that stamps out NCOs like that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Someone told me Morrow was at Hades Hive with Yarrick, back in the day. You want to annoy him, be my guest. I'll watch."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Trust me - you don't want to cross a hero of Armageddon. The Steel Legion have a good reason for their reputation."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_01","Got talking to one of the sentries. Did you know Morrow was in the middle of the Xanatros Purgation?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_02","So ... I heard Morrow was dab bang in the middle of the Xanatros Purgation."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_03","I've been asking around. Guess what? Morrow was on fragging Xanatros when it all went to hel."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_01_04","Ain't many of the Inquisitor's lot who'll talk, but one of them said Morrow was on Xanatros when they brought down the fire."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Remind me which one that was? You've seen one cleansing, you've seen 'em all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","Xanatros. Rings a bell, but it ain't like we're short of wars."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_03_03","Genestealers. Need I say more?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","You reckon Morrow was working for the Inquisitor back then?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","Xenos scum. What was Morrow doing there? The Inquisitor's eyes and ears?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_01","Be surprised if that wasn't the case. Let's hope Atoma goes better than Xanatros ... for all our sakes."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_02","Wouldn't bet against it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_03","Seems a dead cert to me. Wonder what happened to the rest of his team?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_05_04","That ain't the question. The question is, what happened to them who was there with him?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow was at Hades Hive? Must be older than he looks."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow fought in the Second War for Armageddon. He must be old."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","I heard his transport ship got lost in the Warp. Stuck there for centuries. It happens."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","I heard tell he was lost in the Warp. Only survivor of a Golgotha-class transport until the Inquisitor found him."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","Not sure it matters. He's in charge. End of conversation."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Doesn't much matter to us, does it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","That Tech-Priest's an odd sort, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","Never know where I stand with that Tech-Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","I've known worse. Still ... ain't exactly human, is she?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","At least she has a sense of humour ... Sort of."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","We need to stay on her good side, so that's what I'm doing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Not someone I want to wind up, if you follow me?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","Yeah? How well do you think it's going so far?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Could be a bit easier, don't you reckon?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","Prayer's kept me intact all these years. You don't knock what works."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","Won't catch me arguing. Light in the darkness, he is."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","I'll be honest, I understood about a third of that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Well, that was as clear as mud. At best."

"loc_veteran_male_a__hunting_circumstance_start_b_02","Well that ain't good news. Then again, when is it ever?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__hunting_circumstance_start_b_03","Sigma-Minoris-33? I hate those great slavering beasts."
"loc_veteran_male_a__hunting_circumstance_start_b_04","Oh, we're in for a real treat today, comrades."
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_door_open_01","It's open."
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_door_open_02","Door's open. Let's take a look."
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_almost_done_01","Almost there!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_almost_done_02","Nearly!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_almost_done_03","Not long now!"

"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_det_pack_a_02","Placing Alpha 1-9!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_det_pack_a_03","It's going to blow!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_det_pack_a_04","Setting charge!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_det_pack_b_01","Stand clear! Breaching!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_det_pack_b_02","Heads down!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_det_pack_b_03","Good positioning, soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_det_pack_b_04","Couldn't have done it better myself."

"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_one_down_03","That's it!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_one_down_04","That's one!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_event_one_down_05","First one's down!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_extraction_response_01","Time to leave!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__info_extraction_response_02","Get fragging moving!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__intro_01","Just another day in the Imperial Guard.  Only … I’m not even part of the Guard any longer, not since that business with the commissar, the court martial and the holding cell. Now I’m part of this merry band of maniacs, for better or worse. Still figuring out what that means, exactly, but most of it seems to be putting the boot in on the Emperor’s enemies and not getting summarily executed for meeting the wrong stare funny, so I guess I’m better off. At least, so long as the ammo and grub doesn’t run out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__knocked_down_1_01","I'm down!"

"loc_veteran_male_a__knocked_down_2_02","Won't anyone help me up?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__knocked_down_2_03","Little help? Useless lot."

"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_apartments_01","You think this is spartan, you should see a Militarum barracks."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_apartments_02","All the comforts of home, if you're not picky."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_apartments_response_01","Yeah. Crammed tight and so desperate to get out they'll take any offer ... even when the Guard comes recruiting."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_apartments_response_02","Beats being in the trench lines, I guess."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_atrium_01","I grew up in a place like this. Ain't got fond memories."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_atrium_02","Thought I'd left places like this behind for good."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_b_response_b_01","I don't like this, sarge ..."

"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_collapse_01","Fragging hel! It's coming apart!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_collapse_02","The gantry's collapsing!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_corpse_01","Throne! That's a real mess, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_corpse_02","Poor devils. They've done a number on them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_goo_01","Eyes open. Reckon we've found the reason for the quarantine."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_goo_02","We came looking for plague. Guess we've found it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_market_response_01","It's quiet down there. That's what a quarantine does, I suppose."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_market_response_02","Strange to see the stalls deserted."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_security_01","I see the enforcers abandoned their post. Not a surprise."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_security_02","No sign of anyone in that security post. Reckon they got out in time?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_temple_01","What the fragging Hel is this place?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_temple_02","Yeah, I reckon this is what we were looking for."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_vista_01","Look at it all. No idea what their neighbours are up to, some folk."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_vista_02","Strange kinda beautiful, this place. Let's hope it stays that way."
"loc_veteran_male_a__level_hab_block_void_01","Yeah. This is real welcoming."

"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_grenade_06","Got a grenade!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_grenade_07","Who wants a grenade!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_grenade_08","Let's put that grenade to use!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_grenade_09","Grenade? Nice."
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_grenade_10","Grenade? Lovely."
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_01","Medicae station!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_02","Medicae terminal. Patch yourselves up!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_03","Med station! Heal up!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_04","Medicae, at last."
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_05","Med station!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_06","Med station!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_07","Regulation Zeta-112!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_08","Get patched up!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_09","Dead soldiers win no wars. Use the Med station."
"loc_veteran_male_a__look_at_healthstation_10","Medicae! You heard me!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_four_b_01","I've actually heard about this. The Big Man's not wrong."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","I'd heard that. What a galaxy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_four_c_01","You're not going to start on about Grey Ogryns again are you? They're just a myth!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_four_c_02","Next you'll be telling us Grey Ogryns are real..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_a_01","Served with a Ratling squad once. Best fragging snipers I ever saw."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_a_02","You know what we need? Ratling Snipers. Best marksmen in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_a_03","Wouldn't mind some sniper support. Ratlings would be my choice."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_a_04","Ever seen a Ratling Sniper in action? Take out a heretic from a mile away."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_b_01","They'd be useless on this mission. Spend half their lives asleep!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_c_01","Our company cook was a Ratling. Always partaking of his own wares."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_c_02","They like a tipple, for sure. Swear being drunk makes 'em even better shots."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_b_02","Not as many stable strains as there once were. Maybe they're dying out..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","Ever seen a Nightsider? Big eyes... See in the dark. Creepy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","Some of 'em can't even leave their home world. Like Troths - they're a funny bunch."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_two_b_02","There's none more loyal than an Ogryn. Be pretty sad if the Emperor didn't give 'em souls."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_two_c_01","Are there different kinds of soul? Maybe abhumans have lesser souls. Who knows."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","Reckon the Emperor does right by his flock, human or otherwise."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","Know what they say: Infantry win firefights. Tanks win battles. Artillery win wars. Officers lose the lot."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","Ever seen an armoured company rolling out? Brings a tear to the eye..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","Atoma makes a cracking Leman Russ. One of the reasons we're here I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","They make Leman Russ battle-tanks here on Atoma. Good ones, too."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_01","Really miss the Guard. Being part of something bigger."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_02","I like this job, and all, but I miss having the might of the Imperial Guard at my back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_03","What I wouldn't give for the support of my old platoon..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_04","By the Throne, I miss the Guard. They were the days, eh?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","You know where you are with a good platoon structure."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","True. Proper soldiering, none of this sneaking about."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","Not sure about this ""Astra Militarum"" lark, It'll always be the Guard to me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","Few Sentinels. Air support strafing around outside. Boots on the ground... Can't beat it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Be fair, their job is to inspire, as well as... erm... execute cowards."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","I can see how dishing out summary executions could give someone a bad rap..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Nobody likes a Commissar, but you sure as hel better respect them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Someone's gotta keep order. Nobody says it's fair."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","They knew how to get a battle-line fired up, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","Once they started preaching, nothing short of death would stop 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","Did have a funny habit of just walking into enemy fire. Something about armour of faith."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","We lost a fair few preachers. Turns out faith isn't much of a shield, and hate makes poor armour."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_four_b_01","Mate of mine once told me that piracy was just a matter of flags."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_four_b_02","Could be. Things get murky on the frontier."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_four_c_01","Couldn't live that life. I don't have much honour, but it's for keeping."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_four_c_02","I'm more of a ""straight up fight"" sort. If I come for you, it's because you earned it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_a_01","So, I hear that our shipmistress and Grendyl have a complicated relationship."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_a_02","Not sure what to make of things between Brahms and Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_a_03","Grendyl and Brahms have an odd bond ... or so I'm hearing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_a_04","Brahms never quite seems happy to be here, does she?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_b_01","I hear she doesn't want to be here, but Grendyl insisted."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_b_02","Got an old debt to Grendyl, so I was told. She's paying it off."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Reckon I'll steer clear, unless I've no choice."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_one_c_02","I don't want to end up on her bad side, I can tell you that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_three_b_01","From what I can tell, there are vessels from across the Moebian domain docking on a daily basis. Probably weighs on her."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_three_b_02","The Mourningstar's a busy place. Means Brahms has a lot of influence. Stressful, that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_three_c_01","Take my advice: stay on her good side."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_three_c_02","I hear she's fair ... But then again, those who think otherwise probably don't last long."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_two_b_01","Best not let Brahms hear you say that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Not something you want our shipmistress to hear."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_two_c_01","Nothing wrong with trading with aliens ... So long as they mind their manners."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Trade's all right. Just so long as we don't pick up their fancy lingo and strange ways."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_four_b_01","They worship some big, disgusting plague-god. Think disease is a blessing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_four_c_01","They're fragging unpredictable. Disease makes 'em feral... dangerous."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_four_c_02","It's the daemons that rattle me. Big, shambling balls of pus... Fragging disgusting."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_a_01","Seems the heretics worship Chaos as gods. But they can't be gods... can they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_a_02","The way these heretics build shrines and pray to icons... It's like they think daemons are gods or something."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_a_03","The things the heretics worship. They're just daemons, right? I mean... they couldn't really be gods?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_a_04","Tell me the heretics are just misguided, and those things they pray to aren't really gods."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_b_01","No way. They just need the Emperor's light, s'all. Or death; whichever."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_b_02","There's only one fragging god, and He sits on the Golden Throne of Terra."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Ever seen the ones with the 'stigmata'. It's just so fragging depraved..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_one_c_02","Cults always starts out with a few devotees, then it spreads like wildfire. Then you've got a problem."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_three_b_01","When you say ""realm"", you're talking an actual place, where Chaos lives?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_three_b_02","We all know Chaos comes from the Warp... But an actual realm? Sounds kinda crazy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_three_c_01","I usually sleep like a baby during Warp-jumps. Don't ruin it for me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_three_c_02","So, if I have a dream about a daemon sitting on a mountain of skulls, you're saying it comes true in the Warp? [Derisory Laugh]"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_two_c_01","The Guard handbook doesn't really cover fighting Space Marines. They're meant to be on our side."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_chaos_two_c_02","But everyone says Space Marines are the ultimate warriors. Virtually unstoppable... Frag..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_four_b_01","Seriously, Big Man? You've never heard of that enormous Warp rift?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_four_b_02","Only the one of the biggest Warp rifts in the galaxy. You been living under a rock?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_four_c_01","Come on... After what happened to Cadia? Too soon..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Look, we try not to think about the Eye of Terror. Not since Cadia..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_one_a_01","Don't reckon we have much to fear from daemons in realspace... do we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_one_a_02","Won't be any daemons here, right? They don't exist outside the Warp... [Nervous laughter]"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_one_a_03","Daemons are stuck in the Warp, right? I mean... They can't get us here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_one_a_04","We're mostly safe from daemons when we're not Warp-jumping... I hope."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_one_c_01","I did hear that thing about Absolom Reach... But that's just a story..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Wait... I remember that story of the fate of the Hameront Fourth... No, can't be true."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_three_b_01","You mean you could become... possessed?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_three_b_02","Throne... You don't mean a Daemon might possess you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_three_c_01","Can we change the subject? Walls have ears, y'know."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_three_c_02","Back in the Guard, just saying this stuff would get you shot."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_two_b_01","If it could happen there, it could happen anywhere... Even here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Never thought I'd live to see Terra besieged."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_two_c_01","Heard two thousand Adeptus Custodes fell... How's that even possible?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_daemons_two_c_02","Lucky the Adeptus Custodes were there, but even they had it rough."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","The Infantryman's primer says He's a god, and that's good enough for me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","We all took the Ordo Hereticus oath, right? The bit about unquestioning loyalty to the Emperor..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","We're the Ordo Hereticus. We shoot people for these sorts of questions, remember?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_01","If things get bad, reckon the Sisters of Battle might lend a hand?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_02","Wonder if we've got enough clout to get the Sisters of Battle down here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_03","Hope Grendyl's got the Sisters of Battle on standby; just in case, y'know."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_04","Reckon the Sisters of Battle might help us out if things get bad."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","The Chamber Militant of the Ecclesiarchy... Just imagine it!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","The Adepta Sororitas? Here? That'd be something..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","Like to think Grendyl had the clout, but I won't hold my breath."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Right, come on. Daydreaming about the Valorous Heart won't get this job done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Few more Missionaries out there, maybe we'd see less heresy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","Lonely sort of life, though, not like soldiering."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","Takes a lot of planning to convert a lost population. Tough work."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","Hear they work with Rogue Traders. Who knows what they get up to."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","There's no higher honour for the faithful it's said."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Us? Get a commendation from a cardinal? Seems unlikely."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Can't see the Ecclesiarch paying attention to us. He's a fragging High Lord!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","Well, there's this thing called the Godolkin Index which... Never mind."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","Like they taught us in boot camp: If they're funny-looking, they're probably bad."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","Just don't go shooting Navigators or sanctioned psykers - you get into trouble for that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","Psychic mutants are a bit of a grey area, 'specially when they're on our side."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","Can't you ever just follow orders without complaining?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","Look, we got orders. If there's heresy here, it's our job to stamp it out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Even tolerating a heretic is heresy, see. So if you think about it, nobody's really innocent..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Yeah, yeah. Everybody's innocent until you see their Chaos stigmata..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","The Priest's got a point. I mean, they're practically gateways to possession..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","A witch without proper training is an accident waiting to happen."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","I wonder how many psykers slip through the nets of the Black Ships...?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","I've seen even sanctioned psykers lose control. Never ends well for 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","Seriously, Big Man? It's only the biggest mobilisation since the Macharian Crusade."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","It's pretty big news. Don't you pay any attention to the vox?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Still not sure about these Primaris marines though. I mean, like Space Marines weren't big enough..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","How about the Primaris Space Marines? Like a whole fragging army of Guillimans!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_01","Still can't believe Cadia is gone..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_02","Thought Cadia would hold out forever. And now it's gone."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_03","Doesn't seem real that Cadia has gone. Sometimes it just hits me, you know?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_04","Cadia finally fell, huh? So many proud soldiers gone, just like that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Didn't call it the Bastion World 'cos it sounded good. But nothing lasts forever."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","That damned Eye of Terror. Threw every possible horror at Cadia until it fell."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","The battle raged across the whole segmentum. But Cadia bore the brunt."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","They say the Indomitus Crusade is the greatest counter-attack ever!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","They say people just turned into psykers overnight!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Lots of psykers losing control... Losing their minds. And you know what happens after that..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","You know what comes with all this psychic hokum? Fragging Daemons, that's what."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","It's no coincidence we're seeing more daemonic incursions than ever. Throne save us..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","I hear there are whole Space Marine chapters stuck in the Dark Imperium."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","Baal is in the Dark Imperium, right? That means even the Blood Angels are stuck out there."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","We'll get it back. Lord Commander Dante is in charge in the Dark Imperium, and he never loses."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","But they've named Commander Dante as regent of the Dark Imperium, right? He'll get it back, don't you worry."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Good. The more warm bodies we've got, the better the chances of victory."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","As it should be. There's plenty of work to be done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","We're gonna need more. I've a bad feeling about this one."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","Can't have too many soldiers for what's coming."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_01","Grendyl's a mysterious sort, ain't that so?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_02","I've been asking around. No one know much about Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_03","Grendyl ... I wonder who he is. Or she. Or whatever."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_a_04","Grendyl's a secretive one, no question about that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","Inquisitors have secrets, and they don't like questions."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","So Grendyl's careful? Makes sense to me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","Still, you don't become an Inquisitor by accident. We can trust Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","Don't matter really. Chain of command still applies ... even around here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Inquisitors have a lot going on. Bad as things are here, they're worse elsewhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","There are always fires need putting out. Grendyl can't be everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","Doesn't change our job, does it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","We'll just have to hold the line then, won't we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","Could be. It's not like we've that much to go on."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Let's hope so. Faithless commanders don't win wars."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Faithful or not, you'd better follow Grendyl's orders."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","Just remember, the Emperor sees all, so you'd better do your part."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_four_b_01","What? You can understand all that gabble?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Hang about ... You actually know what all those words mean?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Who knew? Big Man's smarter than he looks."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_four_c_02","I might need you to translate for me, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_a_01","That Tech-Priest might be creepy, but she knows her way around a weapon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_a_02","That Tech-Priest gives me the shivers, but she can sure make a weapon sing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_a_03","Anyone else find that Tech-Priest creepy?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_a_04","It ain't just me, is it? The Tech-Priest's a bit ... unsettling?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_b_01","Ah, she's all right. Better than the Enginseer in my old regiment."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_b_02","I've known worse. Much worse. Some of these machine-heads go a bit ... funny."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_c_01","Long as she keeps my guns in order, we're all good."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Ah, there's worse than her waiting for us on Atoma."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I thought you weren't supposed to go poking around?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Oi! You keep out of my head! You hear me?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_three_c_01","I don't want any part of this conversation."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Fragging psykers ... No sense of boundaries ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Aye, likely enough. Bio-implants keep a body ticking long past its sell by, if you follow."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Could be the case. Mechanicus types don't often have much flesh left to get old."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_two_c_01","I know one thing: we'll be lucky to live so long ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hadron_two_c_02","Hey, if I make it to her age, I'll be happy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","You want to be careful, Big Man. It'll mean dirty work."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","I've seen the sorts she favours. Nasty lot, and that's by my standards."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Maybe stay put, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","You're better off here, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_01","I'm not crossing Commodore Hallowette. Not for all the aquilas on the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_02","That Hallowette's a tough one, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_03","There are deck plates on this ship more yielding than Commodore Hallowette."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_a_04","Don't care what you pay me, I'm not even looking funny at the Commodore."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The purser? Why, what have you heard?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Oho, I sense some purser-related gossip. Let's have it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","Saw her dressing Rannick down, I did. Too soft to make out details, but he was white as a corpse when they were done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","Only woman on this ship who puts a shiver into Rannick. That's enough for me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","I know what you mean. She drives a hard bargain."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Captive consumer base, ain't it? Where else are we gonna go?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Worst bit is she claims it all back if we die."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","Worse, as far as she's concerned we're just renting. We get offed, she gets it back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Oh, I don't know ... Hallowette's all right."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","She's a bit of an acquired taste, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","Still, I wouldn't take my eye off her, if you follow?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","Even so, you wouldn't want to be alone with her in a dark corridor ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Nobles, that's who. Best steer clear of that sort, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Highborn families, Administratum officials, maybe even a deacon or two. Powerful people."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Way I see it, s'just like the guard. Top brass, officers, soldiers. All got a part to play."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","Lots of those families send their second-born children to join the Ministorum. Keeps the wheels greased."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_a_01","Problem with hive-cities is all the fragging gangs."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_a_02","Every hive's the same. Fragging gangers stinking the place up."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_a_04","I know we have to stay on-mission, but by the Throne I'd like to take out some of the gangs..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Ninety billion souls in Hive Tertium alone. Gonna be a lot of bad elements among 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","I try not to judge ninety-billion hivers by the deeds of the few... But I really hate gangers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Official numbers put the criminal underworld at two percent of population. Could've fooled me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Scum of the earth... But I've seen 'em get trained up to be pretty good soldiers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","They always look good from the drop-ships. Works of art. Then you get inside and... yeesh."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Imagine living in the lower hive. All of em got scurvy, sump fever or rotskin. Maybe all three."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","All I know is, Hive Tertium is of value to the boss. That means we gotta clean out these fraggers, quick-sharp."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Nobody ever works their way up spireside. But they have no trouble falling down."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","The secret's the Moebian steel. Makes the best armour in the segmentum."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Strongest steel in the segmetum, with the know-how to forge with it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","Even if we save the metalfabs, they're nowt without workers to man them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","I notice we aren't putting as much effort into rescuing the labourers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Be a miracle if they ring the Bell of Lost Souls for us..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Don't reckon the likes of us start the Bell of Lost Souls tolling."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Sorry, Big Man. Reckon we won't be missed."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_four_c_02","Wouldn't mind getting mentioned in the same breath as Jarran Kell..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_a_01","Non-stop war... You think it's better back on Holy Terra?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_a_02","Wonder what things are like on Holy Terra? Must be better than this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_a_03","Imagine being on Holy Terra. What would that be like?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_a_04","If I could be anywhere else, reckon I'd pick Holy Terra."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Lines are so long, most pilgrims die before they even reach the Sol system."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_b_02","They say its just pilgrims as far as the eye can see."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_c_01","It'd sure be something to see the Golden Throne, wouldn't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Give my fragging right arm to see the Golden Throne, just once."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_three_b_01","If it weren't for the Grand Harvest, the Guard would have no soldiers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_three_b_02","Stow it, Witch. The Grand Harvest is what the keeps the Guard ticking."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_three_c_01","Pay the piper, or face the consequences. Nowt wrong with that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Can't let the Imperium grind to a halt. Tithe's gotta be paid."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_two_b_01","Imagine the power it takes to hold 'em all together."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Galaxy is a big place. Makes you think."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_two_c_01","Had guard duty on a Shrine World once. That was an eye-opener."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Put down a rebellion of a feral world once. More of a cull, really."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","Trust me, Big Man, you don't want the Officio Assassinorum showing up."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","If the Officio Assassinorum show up, you know it's gone to frag."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","It's the Callidus you have to watch out for. Could be anyone. Anywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Callidus give me the creeps. They can look like anyone."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_01","If Grendyl sanctions Exterminatus here, how do you reckon it'll go down?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_02","If you could... y'know... Exterminatus this place... How would you do it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_03","Reckon we could Exterminatus this place? Logistically, I mean."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_a_04","Personally I'd call Exterminatus on this planet... if the logistics checked out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","Redirect an asteroid. Point it at Atoma, and... boom."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Asteroids. Change their orbit, sit back and enjoy the show."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","I like to think we're the better option. Not the cheaper option."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Nice idea... Shame to blow up all these lovely tank factories."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","Somebody has to watch the enforcers. Guess that's us now."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Just don't abuse it, or Grendyl will have your guts for garters."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","It's a hierarchy, see. Enforcers; Adeptus Arbites; us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","I take it you've all studied your Lex Imperialis?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","It's kinda satisfying, uncovering corruption in high places."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","There's never a lack of work, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","The Ordo was founded 'cos the others failed. I call that righteous."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","If this is the Emperor's plan for me, who am I to argue?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","Faith, Big Man. It works through faith."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","Reckon only the Emperor knows, and he ain't telling."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Heard it needs more power all the time. Ain't good news for psykers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","I'm telling you, don't mess with Age of Technology stuff."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_a_04","I think Solar Macharius was the greatest hero of the Imperium. Wish we knew more about him."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","Don't forget Sejanus and Drake - great heroes who fought at his side."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Patron Saint of the Imperial Guard. What a guy!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","It was the traitor, Richter, who done for him. Fragging coward."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","They say he never got over the betrayal of his lieutenant, Richter. Tragic."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Wasn't there an Age of Strife? Doesn't sound very illuminating."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","What, like the Age of Strife, when the xenos almost wiped us out?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Standard Template Constructs - they're the only things worth salvaging."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","It's always fun when they unearth a new tank design... I mean an old tank design."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","That was Goge Vandire's Reign of Blood, yeah? A miracle the Adeptus Ministorum survived."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","I've heard the legend, sure. The ""Reign of Blood"", they called it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Course, it were the Space Marines that brought Vandire down in the end."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Sebastian Thor on one side, the Space Marines on the other... Vandire didn't stand a chance!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_four_b_01","So am I, thank you very much."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_four_b_02","And we can't have too many of those."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_four_c_01","We keep to the straight and narrow, who knows. That could be us one day."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_four_c_02","Wonder what it's like, having an Inquisitor's ear?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_a_01","That Melk's a fussy little fragger, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_a_02","I've known some stuffed shirts in my time, but Melk's something special."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_a_03","I've had it up to here with Melk. Supercilious little bean counter."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_a_04","Throne, that Melk! Somewhere, a servitor array is missing part of its choir."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_b_01","What, you mean Sir Darius Melk the Fourteenth, Lord of the Quartervast?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_b_02","Surely you're not talking of the most humble Sir Darius Melk, thrice decorated for bravery by Lord Dolmar Martialis?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_c_01","Oh yes, very funny. Ha fragging ha."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_one_c_02","Everyone's a comedian ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_three_b_01","He's ex-Administratum, ain't he? That lot are always on the fiddle."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_three_b_02","Typical bureaucrat. Most of them have bloodier hands than me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_three_c_01","We're a right bunch, aren't we? Throne, but Atoma's in trouble ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_three_c_02","Morrow had it right. No-hopers, top to bottom."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_two_b_01","Come again? Barely understood a word of that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_two_b_02","You what? Speak slower and clearer, would you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_two_c_01","I can give you elocu-- elac-- speaking lessons, if you'd like?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_melk_two_c_02","Fancy talk gets folk killed in battle. You do know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_four_b_01","No way! Grendyl wouldn't let him live, never mind have him on board the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Steady on, Big Man. I ate not long ago."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Still, might explain the sarge's rigid manner, if you know what I mean?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_four_c_02","To be honest, telling a good NCO and a robot apart's a tricky business."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_a_01","Scuttlebutt says that Morrow was part of the clean up after the Badab War."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_a_02","I was hearing this ain't Morrow's first gig thwarting Chaos. He was at the Badab War."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_a_03","Morrow's been at this awhile, so I heard. Fought at Badab, decades ago."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_a_04","Morrow gets around. Fought in the Badab War ... at least, that's what I heard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_b_01","I heard that too. Makes you think."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Well, well, well. Can't say I'm not prepared to believe it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Might be true. Life in the Guard can take you anywhere. I mean, look at me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Ain't healthy to be gossiping about folk who can have you up on charges ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Not really. A good NCO gets around."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_three_b_02","So he's travelled. Nothing odd about that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_three_c_01","Question is, who's telling the stories? Morrow, Rannick, or someone else?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_three_c_02","You reckon Morrow's making it all up himself? Might be the case."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Give over ... He'd be much too old."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_two_b_02","He'd have been dust long ago - even if the 'Nids didn't eat him."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_two_c_01","I don't know ... stranger things have happened."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Look, truth gets strange sometimes, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Ah, she's tiny by most standards. You should see the really big ones."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Oh, they get much larger than this. You should see the grand dames moored at Bakka."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","I hear she saw plenty of action out on the Rim not so long ago. Must be a tough lady."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","You've got to be hardy when a Rogue Trader's at your helm. It's a dangerous life."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Because he's in command, Big Man. Never see his sort at the front."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Someone has to hold things together. That's him."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Trust me, we're better off with the officer class out of the way."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_four_c_02","An officer's place is at the back, ours is at the front. You don't knock what works."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_a_01","Rannick's a cold fish, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_a_02","I never quite know what Rannick's thinking."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_a_03","Rannick's not exactly one to let his thoughts show, is he?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_a_04","I always shiver when Rannick takes a gander in my direction."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Ah, he's all right. Trust me, we could do worse."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_b_02","To him, we're criminals. Gotta prove ourselves, ain't we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Ah, high-ups are all the same. Live in a different world, they do."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_one_c_02","Best not to worry about it. He has his job, we've got ours."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_three_b_01","Probably Grendyl's grooming him. That's why he's running this op with so little oversight."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Certainly has a lot of latitude. Grendyl's practically leaving the whole show to him."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_three_c_01","I'm just glad he's dedicated. Atoma needs someone like that at the sharp end."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_three_c_02","We could do worse for an officer, trust me on that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Well, that ain't good. Someone with his authority should be as devout as they come."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Knew it as soon as he opened his mouth. More eager for explanations than for prayer."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_two_c_01","He'll learn. We're gonna need the Emperor's Light to get through this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_rannick_two_c_02","It's too much time spent looking at requisitions and intel reports, I reckon. Drains the spirit, all that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_a_01","The Imperium'd fall apart without servitors."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_a_02","Can't imagine an Imperium without servitors."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_a_03","Servitors get everywhere. They're the backbone of the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_a_04","Do you not find servitors reassuring?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_b_01","It's a selfless existence, blessed by the Emperor himself."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_b_02","I find 'em inspiring. They're part of what makes the Imperium what it is."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_c_01","It's just another form of service. Can't all be heroes, can we?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_servitors_one_c_02","Not my kind of service, I admit. I'm happier with a rifle and bayonet."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Guess they take after the Emperor."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","Emperor made em that way."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Heard their wounds heal in seconds. Imagine that!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","You could rip their arm off and they'd keep fighting. Impressive..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_01","Never any Space Marines around when you need them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_02","Pity the Space Marines aren't getting involved."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_03","What I wouldn't give for a few Space Marines right now..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_a_04","How bad's it have to get before the Space Marines get involved?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Saw the Imperial Fists in action once. Nowt left standing when they'd finished."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","Gotta be real bad before the Adeptus Astartes sully their hands."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","If they come, I hope they send the Ultramarines."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","It's the boys in blue I'd like to see. Send in the Ultramarines!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","Never thought I'd live to see such days."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","Said he'd return in our darkest hour. Guess this is it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Look, he's Lord Commander of the Imperium. The roster don't lie."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Wonder what this means for the Ultramarines?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","Even the Guard learned a thing or two from that book."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","The battle tactics are sound... If you're a hulking great Space Marine."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Without the Codex, things would be pretty bleak. Well... more bleak."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Guilliman is the greatest hero of the Imperium, and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","Reckon he's incorruptible... Sits in a stasis field, like Guilliman."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","Probably preserved as he was in life. Incorruptible."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Heard the Golden Throne is so tall, those at the bottom can't even see Him."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","The Emperor protects - that's all we need to know."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_01","Do you think the Emperor can... you know... talk?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_02","Reckon the Emperor ever talks to his attendants?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_03","Imagine what it must be like to hear the Emperor's voice..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_a_04","Has anyone living ever heard the Emperor speak, you think?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","Ain't spoken for ten thousand years... Give or take."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","Couldn't even imagine hearing the Emperor's voice..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","I guess the High Lords of Terra must understand him."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","Well, he must command the High Lords of Terra somehow."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Can't have unsanctioned witches running about. Might as well put 'em to use."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","It's a noble sacrifice. Them psykers are too dangerous to go free."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","I confess, if I was a psyker I'd fear the Black Ships catching up with me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","It's a harsh reality, but still... Nasty way to fragging go."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","I hear you, Priest. It's no kind of life for one so great."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","He made the Golden Throne himself, right? He knew it was coming..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","Legends say he was struck down by his own son... Must've stung."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","He's endured for ten thousand years... He'll never fail."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Well, it sort of folds into the Immaterium and... um... Does anyone else wanna take this?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Imagine you fold a bit of paper in half. That's space, yeah? Stick a knife through it and... Ah, never mind."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Truth is, without the Navigators we wouldn't get very far."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Put it this way, there's a reason the Navis Nobilite are the wealthiest families in the galaxy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_01","All these years, and I still get nervous about Warp travel..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_02","I love the Guard. Except for the Warp jumps. Not so keen on them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_03","Warp travel messes with my head... Not to mention my insides."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_a_04","Never get used to Warp travel, no matter how many jumps I make."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","I've heard stories of whole regiments going missing in the Warp."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","Remember that time the Valhallan 101st popped out of the Warp a hundred years late? Throne alive..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","Sticking to the Mandeville Points is the secret to safe travel. Mostly."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","Always prefer to spend extra time getting to a Mandeville Point. Safer that way."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Yeah, the time difference between realspace and Warp space can be rough."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","That's why we take the slow lane out to a Mandeville point. Cuts down on the craziness."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","Could be worse. Could run into a Warp storm."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","Deployed on a ship that got delayed once. Missed the battle. But least we got there..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","""Warp entities"", the top brass call 'em. We've all seen them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","You mean Warp entities? Best just ignore them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","One thing I've learned about Warp travel: Don't ever look out the viewports."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","Swear I saw an Enslaver once. So many tentacles..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Not me. Then again, I don't think she likes me back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","You've got funny tastes, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","Galaxy's gone mad, it has. And us with it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","Throne! I suppose there's no accounting for taste."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_01","That Psykhanium mistress ... Sefoni ... gives me the creeps."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_02","I don't much like that Sefoni ... even before she starts poking around my brain."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_03","That Sefoni? Creeps me out something proper."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_a_04","I should stop by the Psykhanium, get some training in. But Sefoni? She's a sinister one."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","I know what you mean. I don't trust her."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Yeah. She's unsettling, even for a psyker."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","No good comes of complaining. Best just to knuckle down and get on."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Orders is orders. You don't have to like working with the freak."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","The Psykhanium keeper? She's a cold one."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Yeah, I saw you were friendly. Two Freaks together."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Creepy is what she is."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","She gives me the heebie-jeebies."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","I've had worse drill sergeants ... I'll tell you that for nowt."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","Training's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's kinda the point."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Can't say I like her, but she does a good job."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","She's keeping you alive. Be thankful."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Valkyries are made for speed, not your coddled bones."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","I suppose you'd like to be wrapped up in teddle-wool next time?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Any landing you can walk away from, and all that ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","I'm not sure you're cut out for this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_war_end_b_01","If the Emperor's with us, yes."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_war_end_b_02","Long as we stay true to the Throne, we'll win through."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_war_end_c_01","Don't much matter. We've got our orders."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_war_end_c_02","You just keep fighting, you hear me?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Dunno, Big Man. Maybe you're thinking of a K'nib?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_four_b_02","News to me. Sounds nasty though."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_four_c_01","Hold on... There was the Lacrymole, wasn't there? Pretty sure they're extinct though."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_four_c_02","Dunno about infecting, but there are Mimics, aren't there? They sort of... mimic people."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_a_01","Wouldn't mind another go at the xenos. Nice break from all this heresy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_a_02","Since I signed up for Hereticus detail, I sure do miss fighting xenos."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_a_03","Remember when xenos were the worst thing we had to fight? Almost miss it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_a_04","Bet most of you lot never fought against xenos. Some weird stuff out there, I can tell you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_b_01","You know where you are with a scum-sucking traitor. Xenos are just so... alien."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Give me a lasgun and a fragging alien to shoot at, and I’ll die happy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_c_01","Clearly you've never seen anyone eaten by a Krootox."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_one_c_02","Feel like we've got a fighting chance against these heretics. Against a T'au gunline? Not so much."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_three_b_01","I don't think the Ordo Xenos are beyond dabbling, but I wouldn't try it myself."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_three_b_02","You're talking like one of the Ordo Xenos. We don't mess with that alien rubbish here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_three_c_01","You know about Blackstone Fortresses, right? They weren't built by us, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_three_c_02","Wouldn't mind getting my hands on a Hrud fusil rifle though. A soldier can dream..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_two_b_01","I wouldn't underestimate them. Their psykers are dangerous. Very dangerous."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_two_b_02","Ever seen 'em fight? Might as well try to catch starlight as fight Aeldari up close."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_two_c_01","Something about the way they fight; it's like a dance. Like killing for them is an art form."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_xenos_two_c_02","Reckon they know more about Chaos than we ever will, and that fragging worries me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_four_b_01","I'm not planning on crossing her, I can tell you that much."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_four_b_02","Won't find me giving her any chat-back."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_four_c_01","Just as well. Atoma's no place for the weak."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_four_c_02","Gotta be strong in a warzone like this, else you're dead meat."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_a_01","The explicator's not bad, deep down."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_a_02","The explicator acts hard, but I reckon her heart's in the right place."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_a_03","Don't be fooled by Zola's manner. She's one of the good ones."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_a_04","I reckon we can trust Zola ... even if she ain't part of the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_b_01","She's a bit focused, maybe, but that's probably a good thing, considering."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_b_02","She's not so bad. We could do a lot worse."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_c_01","She's done all right by me. I'll gladly follow her into battle."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_one_c_02","Doesn't matter much. She's in charge, so we follow. Simple as."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_three_b_01","The best COs are always like that. Don't knock it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_three_b_02","I've known plenty like her. They make for good soldiers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_three_c_01","She knows what she wants, and how to get it. That's good enough for me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_three_c_02","I've followed worse, and I reckon I will again."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_two_b_01","Oi, I'll have you know I'm as devout as they come. Always have been."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_two_b_02","Don't take that tone. The Emperor's Light is what keeps me going."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_two_c_01","Don't know about anyone else, but I find Zola's faith inspiring."
"loc_veteran_male_a__lore_zola_two_c_02","Won't get far without the Emperor at your side, that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Got one! Need an escort!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Got one of the fraggers! Give me some cover!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_alarm_01","Someone kill that fragging alarm!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_alarm_02","We need to shut off that alarm!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","I guess we're not going in through the front door?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","Main entrance is locked up tight. No fragging way in."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","It's an impressive place, I'll give it that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","How does anyone keep track of what's kept in here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","This data then ... where do you reckon it'll end up pointing?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Where do you think this proof will lead? ... If we get it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","All looks pretty automated are here, doesn't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Lot of automation in this place. Not many human beings even at the best of times."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","Looks like we're getting wet feet again ... "
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Oh look, another sewer. Lovely. Just fragging lovely."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Wouldn't it be easier if we just drove the train out of here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Still don't see why we don't just drive the train out from under their noses ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Well, when you put it like that ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","It was just a thought. No need to be like that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","How'd you end up working for Grendyl anyway, Tech Priest?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You another criminal, Tech Priest? How did you end up here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Somehow, I knew you were gonna say that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Definitely a reply ... Not so sure about it being an answer."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I hope our reinforcements are on their way."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","So, these fragging reinforcements of ours coming, or what?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Well, we're committed now. Better get it done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Shame to have come all this way for nothing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Busy place, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","This place never stops working, does it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Don't suppose anyone thought to bring a fragging map?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","Anyone bring a fragging map? Anyone even look at one?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Would you look at that? Something nasty came through here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Looks like something big came through here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Sentry duty, is it? Never thought I'd miss those days."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","Never did enjoy sentry duty myself. Safer than where we're going, mind."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Do you reckon there's any chance the Water Cartel can come back from this?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Water Cartel's seen better days, that's for sure. You reckon they're done for?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Well, I shan't lose any sleep over a bunch of gangers, I can tell you that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","They won't be missed. Then again, who is?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I'm surprised the heretics took over the Water Cartel so fast."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","I can't believe how quickly the heretics took over this place."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","The wages of sin, eh? Mind you, the wages of virtue don't seem much better."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Had it coming, didn't they? Couldn't happen to a more deserving bunch."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","So, explicator. How'd you end up joining the inquisition anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Been with Inquisitor Grendyl a while, haven't you explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Fair enough. Not our business anyway, most likely."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Have it your way. But it can't hurt to know more about the folks you're fighting for."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_insignia_01","""Cartel""'s just a fancy name for scum, if you ask me. They ain't proper soldiers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Look at that. The Water Cartel fancied themselves as soldiers. Fat chance."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","Not much of a living, is it? Sifting rubbish from muck?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","Can't imagine having to subsist on what others throw away."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","Look at that decay! If the water does that to rockcrete, I don't want to think what it's doing to my skin."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","This place is falling apart good and proper. Give it a couple of centuries and there'll be nothing left."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Right. We're at the bazaar. Looks like they've been having a crack at one another again."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","Look at all this. Any chance they'll wipe themselves out if we leave them to it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_shanty_01","Not much of a life to be had down here, is there?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_shanty_02","Life ain't ever easy, but I'll warrant it's harder down here than in most places."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_water_course_01","Would you look at that? Hard to think that it's water, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cartel_water_course_02","Don't go swimming in that lot, comrades. Won't end well."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","All right! Elevator's inbound! Hold this position!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Elevator's coming! Dig in - let's show these heretics how to fragging fight!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Come on, spill. Why can't we broadcast this message from the Mourningstar?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","Still can't see why the Mourningstar can't send this message out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","Well, ain't that just fragging perfect?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Heh. Knew it. I just fragging knew it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","Who's this transmission for, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","Briefing never said who this transmission was for."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Fair enough. Secrets are secrets."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","Worth an ask, I suppose."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","Do we know what's in this transmission at least?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","Any info on what's in the transmission?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Can't argue with that. Bad intel gets folk killed."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","All in a good cause then? Ain't always the case."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Another mission with spotty intel. Just my fragging luck."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Another day, another thankless fragging mission."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_way_in_01","Here! I reckon this'll get us inside."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_complex_way_in_02","Reckon we can get in over here!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Reckon they'll get this place up and running again if we pull this off?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","So … Assuming we're not all blasted to smithereens, reckon they'll get this place working again?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Would it kill you to speak in a language we could all understand?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","You see … You said a lot of words, but I'm still not sure what you meant."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Even if we can save the manufactorum, I reckon the workers have had it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","What about the workers, then? Those poor bastards long since dead or gone?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","I'd rather be in the Guard. At least there you're allowed to fight what's killing you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Throne! The poor sods 'd be better off joining the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Just how important is this place to the war effort, then?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","This place must be fragging important for all this fuss."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Just as well we're here to save the day then, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Looks like we get to be heroes today, then. Does it come with better pay?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_heat_01","Throne, but it's fragging hot out here!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_heat_02","Can't say I'm in love with this heat. Every mouthful tastes like ash, and all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Won't be sorry to get out of this sweatbox!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_leaving_02","I think I've forgotten what the cold feels like …"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Now that? … That's a long way down."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Mind the edge, comrades. You'll not bounce when you hit bottom."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Right. This looks like the Overseer's Office. Next stop: Coolant Control."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","So hot I think I'm gonna melt, but we're almost to Coolant Control."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Leman Russ armour plating? Workhorse of the Imperial Guard!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Armour plating? Design looks like a Leman Russ. Fragging love those things."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Is it me, or is it even hotter down here? How do they get any sleep?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Weren't kidding when they said it'd be even hotter down here …"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_deception_01","So we're pulling the wool over the heretics' eyes, are we? I like that idea."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_deception_02","Nothing wrong with a bit of espionage, is there? It's all fair game."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","Look at this place! Even now, it carries the majesty of the Throne."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Blessed Throne! Wish we could restore this place. Doesn't seem right like this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Been a while since the enforcers were hereabouts, I take it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Not been any enforcers around here for some time, have there?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Maybe we'll get it straightened out when the war's done?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Could be chance to put things right, once the heretics are settled."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You ever find yourself in one of these Blocks, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You grew up hereabouts, explicator. Ever find yourself a guest here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Understood. We can't all choose the road we walk."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Fair enough. Not my business, really."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What kind of arch-heretic holes up in a jail?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Why's this heretic lurking in a jail anyway? Seems odd."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Look at that! How do you suppose it stays up?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","You're joking. How do those legs support all that weight?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","Try as I might, I'm never not awed by the scale of these things."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","All this... Engineering on such a scale. Puts me in my place."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","We get to see all the nice places. Watch where you're walking."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","Smells like something died in here. Then again, it probably did."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","Looks like we've hit a market. Shame it's out of hours."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","Stalls all look abandoned. Don't blame them."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Throne, but the whole hab's on the wonk."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","Not sure it should all be leaning like this..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_alive_01","We're doing it! Smelter's coming alive!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_alive_02","Air's getting thicker! Smelter must be warming up!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I've been hearing that Atoma's Leman Russes are special. Any truth in that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","What's so fragging special about Atoma's Leman Russes anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Tougher tanks, eh? Sounds good to me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","So Atoman tanks are tougher than most? Can I have one? Might be handy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I'm not sure I know much about you, Tech Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","You're a bit mysterious, Tech Priest. Makes you hard to trust."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","You see? I've already got that nice warm glow of comradeship."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Wasn't what I was looking for, but it's start."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Strange that the heretics don't simply level this fragging place."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","If I were a heretic - don't get excited, I'm not - I'd just flatten this place. That'd stop it working."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Not sure I like the idea of that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","That sounds bad. I hope Rannick has a plan to stop it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Right, let's find this fragging smelter."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","The smelter can't be far."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Heat's building up. Let's get out of this hel-hole!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_hellhole_02","The air's sweltering already. Time to leave."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Sad to see it all so dark, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_lifeless_02","This place is meant to be alive. Strange that it ain't."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","I have eyes on the main entrance!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","Main entrance, dead ahead!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Nothing like an uplifting slogan or two to keep you working."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_propaganda_02","Must be a great sense of purpose working hereabouts."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Hold your ground! We need to wait for the elevator!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Stand your ground! Let's settle them, Guard-style!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","Gah! Get a lungful of that! Hot metal and charring."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","I hate foundry air. Crawls right down your throat and doesn't let go."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Lots of metalfabs on Atoma. Wonder what makes this one so important?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Heretics really want their claws on this place, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_hack_01","Don't trust these techie missions. I don't know one end of a data-interrogator from another."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_hack_02","Why send me on a techie mission? I'm no good with a data-interrogator."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_hack_03","I don't know one end of a data-interrogator from another."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","Cosy digs. I guess. If you're a heretic."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","Look at those shacks. How do they survive out here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Is it me, or does this place look a little... infested?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Slime everywhere. There something you want to tell us?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Must've slipped everyone's minds. Yeah."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Oh, great. That's just great."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","How did this daemon get here, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","A daemon doesn't just pop out of nowhere. There has to be a reason."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","The heretics brought it? Guess they'll have to die. Not that I planned different."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Emperor preserve us..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","So... There's a daemon infesting this place?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The building's infested, but it's just this one, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Wish I hadn't asked now."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Just once, I'd like it to be good news."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Don't think we're going anywhere in that elevator..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","You know, I think I'll take the stairs..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A vox broadcast that turns you to Chaos? Bit far-fetched, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","It'll take more than a vox broadcast to turn me from the Emperor's Light."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","How high up are we now anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Feel's like we're a long way up the spire. How far's ground level?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","We sure there's no quicker way to the Comms-Plex?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Seems like we're taking the long way around."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Up top again? I don't like it. The air's too thin."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","Anyone else noticed how the air's different up here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Would you look at that? Strange sort of beautiful, but I like it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Not a view we get to see that often. Not sure about all that sunshine, mind."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","It's a fragging trap!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","It's a trap!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","Doors are locked. We're trapped!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","They've suckered us!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","No vox signal. That's not good."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Can't get a vox signal!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Mourningstar? Come in, Mourningstar!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar? ... Can't raise them!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Back to back. Fight it out!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","Weapons up! Give them hel!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","We fight to the last. Got it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","We go down fighting. That's how the Guard do it!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_district_gate_01","Looks like the Scabs have sealed off access to the next district. Good strategy."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_district_gate_02","District Gate's sealed. Keeps things compartmentalised. Easier to control."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","So, what does this Logistratum do, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","I'm still not clear what this Logistratum's for."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","We'd better take it back sharpish, then."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Won't be easy, assaulting this place head-on."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Seems you know your way around this place, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Another of your old haunts, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Well, you're doing the Emperor's will now."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Not everyone hits the straight and narrow first time out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","How come we never get to see any of this special issue ammo?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Can't say I've seen any special issue ammo back in the armoury."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Typical. Nothing says 'thank you' like nothing."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Doesn't seem fair, that. But whatever."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","Take it from me - never trust a hab block that's locked down like that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","That hab block looks quiet. Never a good sign."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","So we're not exactly knocking on the front door?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Look at us, scratching between the walls like rats."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_trains_01","Trains are still running ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_rails_trains_02","The heretics have the trains running overtime, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Definitely a step up from what we're used to."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","Streets are quiet. No surprise. Wonder if anyone's still alive behind those doors?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","What's taking the fragging bridge so long?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","You take your time, bridge. I've got all night. Honest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","Bridge of Martyrs? What could go wrong?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","Cheery name. I don't think."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","Just our fragging luck."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","Maybe we can just jump across? ... Nah, forget it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","Fraggers don't want to let it go, do they?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","Gonna get company. Be ready!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","The Emperor's with us! That's all that matters."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","They ain't got the training. And we do! ... Well, I do."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","Looks like a preacher's pulpit. Strange to see it empty."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","Even the fragging preachers don't fancy the odds. Not a good sign."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","Let's give the old fool a bit of payback, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","Picking on harmless old ranters. Oi! Pick a fight with us!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Bit of a change of pace from the nasty old downside, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Bit nicer hereabouts, don't you reckon?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_retrieve_01","Looks like it's fetch and carry time. Just like being back in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_retrieve_02","Dragging stuff around under fire? Just a day like any other. Ain't that right, comrades?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scan_01","Scanning mission? Not my thing. I'm a grunt. Hold the line, take that position ... die in the mud."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scan_02","I hate scanning missions. Tech work. Give me a trenchline and artillery support, that's the life."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","I'd say it's nice to be closer to the surface, but I wouldn't want to be thought a liar."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Makes a change from the bowels of Downside, doesn't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","How long's this fragging place been abandoned, anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Throne, but this place is a mess. How long since it was abandoned?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Doesn't mean it ain't worth fighting for. Point me in the right direction, I'll get the job done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Still part of the Imperium though, ain't it. Can't leave it in the hands of the heretic scum."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","What's with the heretics brewing these plagues then? Ain't there enough nastiness in the galaxy?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The heretics are creating contagions out here, are they? Guess it takes all fragging sorts."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Oh, ain't that lovely? This job gets better and better."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Should've stayed in the Guard, that's what I should have done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Something of a transport hub, was it? Back in the day?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","So this was a trading zone, or so I heard. Out-world and in."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Don't think there's much of value around here now. Nor much that can still fly."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Hard times find all of us, sooner or later. Sorry … don't know why I'm so cheery."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_interior_01","Look at the state of this place - one too many hive quakes, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_interior_02","This place has taken a fragging battering, hasn't it? Hive quakes, most likely."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","Throne! Look at this fragging lot. It's a wonder any of them still work."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","Got to admit, there's a bit of grandeur about this place, even in this kind of nick."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Cargo elevator is down. Looks like we're clear to proceed."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","Cargo elevator's in position. Something went our fragging way for a change."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","This place is a fragging maze!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","I hope this place made more sense before bits started dropping off!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_approach_01","I have eyes on Chasm Terminus. It's hard to miss."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_approach_02","Chasm Terminus's in sight. You can bet it'll be a fight to reach the platform."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Right. Stay fragging tight down there and watch each others' backs, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","We work as a team, you hear me? No grandstanding and no running off!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","We'll not let you down."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Don't worry, we've got this."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What are we fragging dealing with down there anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Oi! Control! You mind telling us what we're up against?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Understood. We'll get it done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Fragging great. Time to be miracle workers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","I had a mate end up in a place like this. Didn't come back out again."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","Looks like a magistratum catechizer post. Not somewhere you want to end up."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Atoma's going to hel, and we're making sure the trains run on time. Funny, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","So ... We can redirect a train, simple as that, but ammo's always scarce?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","I wasn't complaining. Not that it'd matter if I was, would it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Easy. Easy. Weren't looking for a fight. Just ... thinking aloud."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","I'm not so sure about all this commando stuff. I was born to fight on the front lines."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","All this sneaking about ... I prefer a straight fight, if I'm honest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","Don't you worry, I'll get it done. Just saying, was all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Yeah. Not many second prizes on the battlefield, if you follow?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","Couldn't we have run the splice from the Chasm Terminus? Might have been quicker."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Never thought I'd be redirecting trains from a marketplace."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","I suppose that makes sense. Insofar as owt does around here."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","When you put it like that, I guess it does make sense."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","This lot look like they're here to stay ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","These soldiers look like they're in it for the long haul ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_station_hall_01","Places like this always make me feel tiny."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_station_hall_02","Look at all that! Takes your breath away, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Looks like there's another assault underway to the south."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_station_the_bridge_02","See that fire-fight off to the south? Let's hope our lot hold."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","Room enough in this place for an army. Let's hope they're elsewhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Wouldn't catch real soldiers living in a slum like this. No standards, this lot."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Bad news, ain't it, if there's a daemon crawling around Tertium?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Can't be good, having a daemon so deep in the hive."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Yeah. Sounds wonderful."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","The Emperor's with us. We need not fear the daemon."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Any chance we'll take this place back from the heretics?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Give the word, we'll come down here and throw the heretics out."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Well, you let me know if that changes."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Understood. Orders is orders."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I don't get it. How can a place this lawless thrive? Doesn't the law mean owt?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","This place is a warren of thugs and chancers. Doesn't seem right."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Fair enough."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","I can't say I understand, but I suppose I don't have to."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","I prefer the traditional kind of statues myself. Something in bronze, or worked stone."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","Feels better to fight in the shadow of a hero of the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","We're not digging through that. We'd better find another way in."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","Can't get in through the main gate. Then again, we rarely can."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","Throne! This place looks like it's about ready to fall down on us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Watch your step! This place could collapse at any moment!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Look at all that. Industrious place, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","Pipe city, ain't it? Ingenious enough, in its way."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","Throne help us all if that atmospheric shield collapses."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","Wonder if there's anything worth having in the wasteland beyond that atmospheric shield?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_crossroads_01","This place is a fragging warren!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Stick together! Let's not get lost down here!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Hard to tell where the daemon stops and the refinery begins ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","This is fragging horrible. Do you think the daemon knows we're here?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","These look empty - keep moving!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","Nothing in these. We need to head deeper!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Into the unknown it is. How bad can it be?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","What I wouldn't give for decent intel once in a while."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Is it me, or did the elevator just lurch?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I wish this elevator would stop shuddering."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Best to ignore it. You'll feel better."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","I'm sure it's not worth fretting about."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Yeah? You'll need a lot more firepower than a four-body team can bring."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","Now that's a fragging good idea! Sign me up!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","A daemon? Here? What did we do to deserve that?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","That was a daemon? You're having me on, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Fragging marvellous. I was better off in my cell."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Yeah, that helps a lot."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Something's been bothering me - are we at risk of infection?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Coming down here ... we're exposed to this pathogen, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","Fair enough. The Emperor Protects, and all that."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Ah, I'm not worried. Strong as a grox, me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","So this pathogen? What exactly is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","What are we dealing with here? A virus, bacteria ... what?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Emperor protect us!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Sounds fragging lovely."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","This place has seen better days. Fragging shame."
"loc_veteran_male_a__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","Everything's falling apart up here. Seems like a waste."
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_01","It's going to attack!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_02","Look out!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_03","Look out!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_04","Get clear!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_05","Get back!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_06","It's attacking!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_07","We've made it angry!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_08","We've done it now!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_09","No! It's attacking!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_combo_attack_10","Get away! Get away!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","We're in it now…"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Looks like we've got a real fight on our hands."
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","Time to earn that pay we don't get…"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","It's bad, but I've seen worse."
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Gonna take teamwork to bring that down."
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","Team effort, or that thing's gonna kill us all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","This might take a while."
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","Hope you're not sleepy, because this is gonna take awhile."
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","Throne! Not one of those. Just our luck!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","This is gonna be a messy one. Work together!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__need_rescue_01","Get me out of this and I'll owe you!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__need_rescue_02","Need a rescue. Come on!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__need_rescue_03","Hey, comrades! Help a soldier out?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__need_rescue_04","You gonna leave me here, or what?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__need_rescue_05","Don't you dare leave me behind!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","Seems there's no end to this daemonic matter."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","This daemonic matter gets everywhere. Doesn't it ever run out?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","Never mind, then."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","Emperor preserve us ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","Why do I get the feeling all this is gonna get worse?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","I've got a bad feeling about this, comrades."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","Easy. Easy. We're all on the same side here ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","Morale's a bit low, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","Don't know why anyone'd worship Nurgle anyway ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","Filthy heretics. Can't figure why they worship Nurgle at all ..."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","Best we put them all out of their misery, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","They turned from the Emperor's light for this?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","Not my first go-around fighting Nurgle worshippers."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","Fought a bunch of Nurgle cultists back in my younger days. Nothing changes."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Right you are."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","Got you. I'll keep schtum."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","You reckon we can save Atoma, even with all this corruption?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","You ask me, Atoma looks past saving, even by us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","Don't worry about us, we'll keep fighting."
"loc_veteran_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","As long as the Emperor wants me fighting, I'll keep fighting."

"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_gang_metropolitan_endless_c_01","They're right though. If it's not this war, it'll be another. Why can't the galaxy just accept the Emperor's peace?"

"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_veteran_01","And that's how we do it in the Guard!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_veteran_02","Easy now, Soldier. Don't settle 'em all!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_veteran_03","Hey Soldier! Save some for me!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_veteran_04","Fragging hel! How many did you get?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_veteran_05","Look at that Soldier go!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_zealot_01","Never thought the Zealot had it in 'em!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_zealot_02","Seems you're worth something after all, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_seen_killstreak_zealot_03","That's what I call devotion!"

"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_01","Get up, Ogryn."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_02","You gonna lie there all day, Big Man?"

"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_04","Come on, Big Man. We're not done."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_05","Can't do this without you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_06","We need you, Ogryn."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_07","You ain't done yet… are you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_08","On your feet, Ogryn. We've work to do."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_09","Stick around, Ogryn. We'll finish this together."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_ogryn_10","Leave you behind? Not a chance."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_01","Useless…"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_02","What good are you, anyway, Witch?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_03","Should've sent a proper soldier…"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_04","Waste of a uniform, you are, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_05","Don't make me regret this, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_06","You stay out of my thoughts, alright Psyker?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_07","Worthless fragging Psykers…"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_08","You get up, Psyker, or I'll end you myself."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_09","What use is a Psyker to us?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_psyker_10","You even look at me funny, I'll leave you there."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_01","Can't leave a mate down, can I, Soldier?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_02","Ain't so bad as it looks, Soldier. Trust me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_03","Here, Soldier … I got you."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_04","Can't keep you down, can they, Soldier?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_05","Let's show those bastards, Soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_06","Just like Pandora IX, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_07","Reminds me of that time at Relay Obscurum."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_08","You'd do the same for me."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_09","Oh, so you need help again, do you?"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_veteran_10","On your feet, Soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_01","Get up, Priest!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_02","No laying around, Priest!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_03","Can't hack it, eh, Priest!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_04","Get your fragging arse back in the fight, Zealot!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_05","Like I thought: all mouth, no staying power."

"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_07","Show us some of that fragging zeal, Zealot!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_08","You're not done yet, Zealot!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_09","Rise up, give 'em hel!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__veteran_start_revive_zealot_10","Up! You ain't earned a rest yet!"

"loc_veteran_male_a__warning_exploding_barrel_05","Barrel's gonna explode!"
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_dust_01","Rotten and broken. Just like everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_dust_02","A few years and there will be just debris and rust."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_dust_03","This is a derelict zone. High levels of decay."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_tank_foundry_01","This place keeps the warzones fed with the tools of war. It fails, we lose. Simple."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_tank_foundry_02","Ammunition, guns, ordnance, all made here. Without it wars already lost."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_tank_foundry_03","Soldiers fight wars, but you need places like this to make the weapons for us."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_throneside_01","This place is tainted. War will cleanse it."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_throneside_02","Abandoned... or hollowed out by darkness."

"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_watertown_02","Law stopped being enforced here a long time ago."
"loc_veteran_male_a__zone_watertown_03","No law here. Just killers and recidivists."

"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_shock_trooper_03","Hitting them from concealment ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_shock_trooper_05","Time for a surprise."
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_shock_trooper_06","Yeah. Gonna enjoy this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_shock_trooper_08","Evading the enemy!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_shock_trooper_10","Karking surprise, coming right up!"

"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_squad_leader_11","Kill the karkers!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_squad_leader_12","Beat them down!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_squad_leader_13","Show me your karking war faces!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_squad_leader_14","Time to earn our pay!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ability_squad_leader_15","Tear the karkers to pieces!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_01","Get back!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_02","Get out of there!"

"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_foul_smoke_04","[Fast, pained breathing]"
"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_grease_pit_01","Nasty looking ooze. Would it drown you, or smother you, do you reckon?"

"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_nurgle_growth_01","Karking revolting, that is."
"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_nurgle_growth_02","You see that? Karking revolting."
"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_nurgle_growth_03","Something nasty's been oozing out."

"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_nurgle_growth_05","[Disgusted Noise] What the karking Hel's that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_sigil_01","Is that the symbol of the consulate? Did passengers use to come through here?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_sigil_02","A consulate symbol? Must've been an entry port, back in the day."
"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_unnatural_dark_a_01","Oi! Who turned out the lights?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__asset_unnatural_dark_a_02","Oh lovely, it's gone dark!"

"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_boot_in_a_01","You and me, we're gonna survive this. Just you wait and see."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_boot_in_c_01","Nah. I'm banking on putting the boot in before it's put in on me, if you catch my drift."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_casting_stones_a_01","You've got a big mouth, do you know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_casting_stones_c_01","A big mouth, and an argumentative nature ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_compliment_a_01","Stick close to me in the next fight will you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_compliment_c_01","I like to keep killers where I can see 'em. You live longer that way."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_dignity_b_01","Oi! Cut out the praying and keep your eyes open. I ain't dragging you back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_dignity_d_01","Hark at him, reckoning there's any dignity left in all this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_eye_to_eye_b_01","Right you are. [Clears throat] You're doing the best you can, and I'm sure the Emperor's dead proud. And your old mam, wherever she is now."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_eye_to_eye_d_01","Picky, picky, picky. No pleasing some people."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_fancy_words_a_01","None of your fancy words next time, got it? Just a battle cry and a good kicking."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_fancy_words_c_01","I'm a survivor, mate. Can't pray through a mouthful of blood, now can you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_vet_b_c_01","Suit yourself. I prefered the hours of sleep I nabbed instead."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_vet_b_e_01","Never seen the point."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_male_vet_a_b_01","You're jealous ain't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_male_vet_a_d_01","Hah! You're jealous. I can hear it in your voice."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_psy_c_b_01","Shot goes in, brain goes out. Lovely."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_psy_c_d_01","Oh, I love this part. Makes me feel alive."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_psy_c_f_01","Hark at you and your fancy words."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_zea_c_b_01","When my time comes, I hope it'll be just as quick."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_zea_c_d_01","Maybe not as reassuring as you meant, but I'll take it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_vet_b_c_01","I ain't looking for your approval."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_vet_b_e_01","Remember what?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_09_b_01","That's right, have a good laugh. They'll get theirs."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_09_d_01","Damn right."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_10_b_01","I never said that. I'm just - ow! - unbelievably stoic."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_10_d_01","Why? What have you heard?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_11_b_01","What for? Nothing wrong with a good scar."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_11_d_01","Good point, well made. Meds for me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_12_b_01","Oh, thanks. Here's me in mortal agony, and that's what you've got to say?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_12_d_01","Oh, hah hah hah."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_13_a_01","Oh look, it's dead meat."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_13_c_01","Right you are. Only ... is this going to take long?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_14_a_01","How are you holding up? That last one looked nasty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_14_c_01","You've looked better too ... I think."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_15_a_01","Don't suppose you've got a code word for what that heretic did for you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_15_c_01","Want me to make one up?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_16_a_01","Gotta hand it to you: you can really take a beating."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_16_c_01","All things being equal, you'd do better not getting shot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_33_a_01","Well, isn't this unfortunate?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_33_c_01","This is me being sympathetic."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_34_a_01","That's another one you owe me, by the way."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_34_c_01","Funny that. Must've hit your head into the bargain."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_35_a_01","I hope you're not planning on giving up?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_35_c_01","You sure, because that's a lot of blood."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_36_a_01","Come on, lazy bones. No time to go having a kip."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_36_c_01","Oi, I resemble that remark!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_37_b_01","I'm resting on my dignity."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_37_d_01","That's right, put the boot in when I'm hurting."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_38_b_01","Doesn't matter. Just one more for the collection."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_38_d_01","You say the nicest things."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_39_b_01","Not that time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_39_d_01","Point taken."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_40_b_01","I didn't ""walk into"" anything. I was being heroic."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_40_d_01","I'll try to keep that in mind."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_language_a_01","Go on, admit it. This funny talk of yours is just a show."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_language_c_01","I've heard you when you think no one’s looking. Swearing like an armsman on latrine duty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_language_e_01","Don't bother me none. You can give it both barrels as far as I’m concerned."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_anywhere_else_a_01","If we could be anywhere else right now, where would you be?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_anywhere_else_c_01","We've really got to work on your imagination."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_anywhere_else_e_01","Lots of 'em. Ones that go ""clink"" and others that giggle."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_cheer_a_01","Here we go. Another hopeless mission into a dark and dingy hole."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_cheer_c_01","I don't do ""down"". Irrepressible cheer, that's me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_complex_b_01","I am? What makes you say that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_complex_d_01","That's me: complex and misunderstood."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_complex_f_01","Charmer."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_confession_b_01","Not any longer. I like to keep it squeaky clean. That way I can steal, murder, cheat ... and other stuff ... as much as I want."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_confession_d_01","I know. That's why I confess that and all. My soul glitters like gold, it does."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_discontent_b_01","Oh yeah. The proclaimator general just happened to pop in for a chat, did he? You know, like he does?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_discontent_d_01","Because they're worried you might stab them?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enforcer_a_01","You know, I'd have made a grand enforcer."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enforcer_c_01","And those are bad things by you? Reckon I'm more cut out for the life than you ever were."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_goals_b_01","I wouldn't count on it. When folk look at wars like this, they see worlds, not populations."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_goals_d_01","Yeah, the rest of us call that ""realism""."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_heretic_teamwork_a_01","Just watch your back, yeah? They may be heretics, but they're working as a team."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_heretic_teamwork_c_01","Look, you say they're damned, I believe it. The soul's your business. Soldiering's mine, and I say they're working together to knock your karking block off."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loot_b_01","Don't worry, you won't. Catch me, I mean."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loot_d_01","Never had reason to. Lacking what you might call ""a positive role model"". Fancy taking on the role?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_cause_a_01","These heretics never give up, do they?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_cause_c_01","Well, when you put it like that ... what exactly are we fighting for?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_cause_e_01","Don't look at me. You started it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_oversimplify_a_01","You know, I'm getting a definite sense of deja vu, but then I get that a lot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_oversimplify_c_01","Well, here's you and me, in a rot-infested armpit of a city, getting shot at by festering sons of sputum. Don't that at least sound a bit familiar?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_poking_around_a_01","Now ... You wouldn't be poking around in my head, would you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_poking_around_c_01","Because you're fascinated. And because you've no sense of boundaries."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_posho_b_01","Oh, don't fret it. Just another posho strutting about with his chest puffed out. Ain't no shortage of those."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_posho_d_01","Like what? You're just in my eye line, is all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_remarkable_b_01","Oh, I'm tired all right. But life in the Guard teaches you that there ain't no point complaining ... No point complaining? No point letting it get you down."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_remarkable_d_01","I am in many ways a remarkable man."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unconventional_b_01","It's war, ain't it? No point following the rules if it leaves you gasping."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unconventional_d_01","That's the problem with omnipresence: can't hide nothing ... Speaking of which, I'd better make confession when we get back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unsettled_b_01","Unsettled? Me? No. Solid as a rock, I am. Dauntless, that's the word."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unsettled_d_01","Look, you can't get round me with flattery."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wolf_a_01","Had a bad dream last night. Can't shake it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wolf_c_01","Really? Mine was just about my teeth all falling out and then laughing at me. Cocky little karkers. But wolves? I ain't seen anything like that on Atoma. Apart from them big dogs."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_zola_dream_b_01","I'm sure she'll be thrilled."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_zola_dream_d_01","Probably nowt. Dreams are dreams. You can't take 'em too serious."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_pleasing_screams_a_01","You get stuck in, Priest. Can't fault you for that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_pleasing_screams_c_01","That's my Mordian groin-gouger. Learnt it off me old sergeant. Wicked bastard, he was."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_pretty_words_b_01","Don't think you can turn my head with pretty words."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_pretty_words_d_01","Thanks! One tries one's best, one does. Nice to be appreciated."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_canny_a_01","You look like a canny fellow, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_canny_c_01","You know, ""smart""? ""Opportunistic""? ""Always got an eye on the prize?"""
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_canny_e_01","Now you're getting it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_cynic_b_01","No point wishing for better, not in this life."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_cynic_d_01","I think you mean ""realist"". Anyway, look who's talking."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_in_charge_a_01","You've got me, Big Man. I've got you. Teamwork, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_in_charge_c_01","Whatever you say. As long as you go first."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_in_charge_e_01","Glad to hear it! I'll be right behind. You make for good cover."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_nicer_a_01","You know, you could try to be a bit nicer."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_nicer_c_01","Yeah, that's a good point. Not exactly sunshine and gyrinx cubs around here, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_nicer_e_01","You're worse than I thought ... and I'm a realist. Takes a lot to shock me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_sneak_a_01","Oi! Are you sneaking around again?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_sneak_c_01","That ain't my fault. It's these boots. They're too heavy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_screaming_lungs_b_01","Keep trying. Maybe they'll get you next time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_screaming_lungs_d_01","Look, if it's a choice between laughing loud and screaming my lungs out from shattered sanity, I'm choosing former every time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_whining_b_01","Oi! I heard that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__bonding_conversation_whining_d_01","I heard that and all."

"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_hound_b_01","I wouldn't hold your breath. That other Ogryn would only eat it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_hound_b_02","Why not? Has to be smarter than some of you lot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_01","Oh, lighten up. If it's hard for us, it's hard for the heretics. Probably."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_02","Complaining again, Big Man? Now there's a surprise."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_01","Oh yeah, I'll get right on it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_02","I don't know. Might be they just want to be friendly."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_01","Simple rule: if you hear screaming, shoot at it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_02","Nothing that a bit of panic fire can't cope with. It's not like they're charging us for the ammo."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_01","Oh, give over. It's a real meeting of minds in your case."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_02","Just because they're faster than you. Smarter too, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_a_01","Gonna be close fighting in this muck."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_a_02","Can't see karking thing! We're gonna have to get stuck in."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_01","You're telling me. Fog's thicker than a Ratling think-tank in here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_02","You're not wrong. Spooky, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_a_01","I'm not much of one for running away, so let's just shoot any Hounds in the face."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_a_02","I'm not running from anything, much less a Hound. Let's just shoot 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_01","I'll be sure to remember that when one's drooling on my face."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_02","Not much comfort when they're gnawing on your bones."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_01","Ain't no guarantees in this life but death, damnation and Sergeant Major Morrow."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_02","Lighten up. We're all dying anyhow. Only the vector changes."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_02_b_01","Just stand well back when you do it, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_05_b_01","Everyone should have an Ogryn for a bodyguard."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_10_b_01","No chance, worse luck."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_11_b_01","Long as you don't ending up fighting ""against"" friends, we're golden."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_18_b_01","They're just plain crazy full stop."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_20_b_01","Yes, killing for everybody!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_06_b_01","Tell us something we don't know?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_07_b_01","You got that right. Don't step forward, and always take a big step back, just in case."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_09_b_01","Everything makes you mad."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_13_b_01","Sure. Next skirmish is all yours. I'll watch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_14_b_01","Is that why you don't listen?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_06_b_01","Guess we aren't worthy of respirators."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_07_b_01","You finally found something you couldn't eat?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_09_b_01","Maybe think a bit less. We don't want your head to pop."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_13_b_01","I didn't know you could count."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_14_b_01","Is that bone from...? Never mind. Don't want to know."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_01_b_01","What? Are you not enjoying yourself?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_04_b_01","I don't know ... running away's got a certain appeal right now."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_b_01","Wars don't, by and large. Best you can do is still be standing at the end."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_b_01","Be careful what you wish for ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_16_b_01","Don't breathe too deep. There's something nasty in the air."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_17_b_01","Hah! It'll do you good!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_01_b_01","Fair. There's not much to like about any of this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_04_b_01","Hear that? We've got a clock-watcher on our hands."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_b_01","Tell him I agree, if you think that'll help."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_12_b_01","There's no need to go making personal comments."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_16_b_01","If it makes you feel better, they're probably saying the same about us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_17_b_01","Erm ... Not really sure how I should answer that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_b_01","Yeah. Nothing quite like the risk of death to make a soldier thankful."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_07_b_01","Trust me, duty gets tiresome."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_b_01","Then I guess I've only ever met bad ones..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_16_b_01","Oh, I dunno. Some of these karkers deserve a bit of suffering."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_17_b_01","A conscience? Luxury."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_06_b_01","Yeah, you keep dreaming."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_b_01","Yeah, yeah, yeah ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_b_01","You're not in the Guard. They locked you up, remember?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_b_01","Save your breath for fighting, why don't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_14_b_01","Oh ... Something to look forward to."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_01_a_01","Another glorious day in Grendyl's service, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_a_01","The worst of it is, this mission is light duty. You don't want to see the other kind."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","Too right. I want as close to an easy life as I can get."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_03_b_01","Not me. I plan on living forever."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_a_01","Can't think of anything I'd rather be doing. Oh, wait ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_06_a_01","Cheer up you lot! Could be worse!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_06_b_01","You had to go and say it aloud, didn't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_a_01","You dozy lot should be taking lessons from me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_b_01","Sounds like a fine way to end up dead."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_08_a_01","Seen one bunch of rotting traitors, you've seen them all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_a_01","Are we done yet? I need a snooze."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_b_01","You and me both."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_10_a_01","You know, I passed up some perfectly good racketeering to be part of this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_11_a_01","There's a heretic lurking under every rock, ain't there?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_12_a_01","You know what I like about all this? No Commissars poking their bony noses into my business."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_a_01","You lot are all right, d'you know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_b_01","Cream of the crop, me. You're lucky to have me around."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_14_a_01","We're a funny looking bunch, but we get the job done."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_14_b_01","Don't we just?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_15_a_01","This place is a karking nightmare, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_16_a_01","If you get cut off, just keep karking fighting. Take some of them with you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_17_a_01","This uniform itches. Just can't get it sitting right."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_18_a_01","Get in close next time! Make the karkers fear you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_19_a_01","Next engagement, none of this fancy footwork. Just get stuck in!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_20_a_01","They've got the numbers, but we've got the skills, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_b_01","Don't go on so, you'll break my heart."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_03_b_01","Dibs on counting the ammo. You handle the rest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_07_b_01","Just another karking day in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_b_01","I don't know ... Sounds like a lot of hard work."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_b_01","Am I supposed the find that inspiring?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_14_b_01","Oi! I'm just warming up, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_01_b_01","Yeah. It's not pretty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_03_b_01","Nope. Didn't understand a word of that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_04_b_01","You do as you like. I like to get paid. Or at least fed."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_07_b_01","You're right. The more I try to understand you, the more I have doubts."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_16_b_01","I seem to have left mine back on the ship."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_17_b_01","I don't know. Once seems like plenty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_01_b_01","Works for me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_03_b_01","I'll give you that one, but don't go crowing about it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_04_b_01","That's exactly the way around I prefer it!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_07_b_01","Follow you? I'll take my chances on my own. See which of us the Emperor loves most, eh?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_16_b_01","... for Morrow and his lot surely won't."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_17_b_01","Well ... Let's hope, anyway."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_b_01","Creed's swagger, not again..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_b_01","Let's not give 'em the satisfaction."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_06_b_01","Wish he'd deliver us some reinforcements..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_11_b_01","I suppose dying peacefully in my sleep is too much to ask?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_15_b_01","Can you be with us a bit quieter?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_16_b_01","Not sure Atoma falling to heretics was part of his great plan."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Are we having fun yet?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_02","Gotta admit, this could be going worse!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_03","Beats sitting around in a jail cell, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Come out and play, heretics!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_05","I reckon they're scared of us!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_06","We're mighty karkers, ain't we?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_07","This could be going better, but it could be going worse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_08","Eyes open - don't let those karkers get the drop on you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_09","You see a heretic's smiling face, open fire!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_10","On we go. Into the karking fire, as usual."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","They're just jealous, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","Creed's swagger... they said it to your face?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","You take all the fun out of soldiering, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","This ain't the Guard. You can't have me up on a charge."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","You should try aiming. It'll help."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","At least you showed that wall what for. Proper dead, it is."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Hey, sticky-fingers! Share the ammo!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Stop hogging all the karking ammo!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Give over stealing all the ammo!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","I saw it first!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Finders, keepers!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","That right? How would I tell?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","So what's karking new?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","There's always trouble ahead. That's how this works."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","Plenty of trouble behind and all. Maybe we should just call it a day?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Suit yourself. I wouldn't let them near my grey matter."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","Ain't no one goes poking in my brain. And yes, I do have one."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Easy there, slugger. This ain't a karking game."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","They've just gotten squirrelly, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Oh, so that ain't your blood I see?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","You sure? You look awful beat up, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Well, that's us cursed. Thanks a bunch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Had to say it, didn't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","That's what you're here for. Go get 'em!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","You got one job, Big Man: Smash."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","I'm starting to think you've ice in your veins, not blood."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","Cold? Give over."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","I always had you down as a karking cut throat."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","You're doing good. Not as good as me, of course."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Bunch of wannabe soldiers if you ask me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Play in filth, get mucky."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","It's what the Guard do best: Die fighting."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","Um... What's option B?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Ask them if they've any advice. We could karking use some."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Invisible friends is it now? Hah."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","They say he once killed an Ork Warboss with a headbutt..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","If all Ogryns were like him, we'd be out of a job."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","What? Having the Emperor in your corner not good enough?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","I'll get right on that, I will."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_a_01","So... If I were to scarper and take my chances, would anyone come with?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_a_02","This is a fool's game. Anyone want to split?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_a_03","We're dead meat if we keep working for Grendyl. Maybe we should desert?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","You do know that Morrow can hear everything you're saying?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","It's tempting, but I don't reckon we'd get far."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Oi, and what am I? Chopped liver?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","Don't know what you mean. I'll take 'em all on!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","Yes sir! No sir! Shine your boots sir?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","You're not in charge. You do know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","Nothing like a kaboom to ruin someone's day."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","We can't all be walking bombs..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Optimistic as ever..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","It's only gonna get worse..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","Let me know if you stop bouncing off the sides of reality, won't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Do you really want an answer to that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Ach, I'm afraid my canteen's completely dry."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","I knew it! The Priest's a sozzle-wit!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","Are you sure? Can't say I've seen him hereabouts."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","Is that so? Maybe we can bunk off ... leave him to it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_a_01","You reckon this is the end of Atoma?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_a_02","Well, this planet's done for, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_a_03","Could be curtains for Atoma, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","Doesn't look good, and that's for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Looks like. Then again, the Guard have pulled places back from worse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","This is nothing. You should see where I grew up."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Don't take it personal. Most folk are sheep, following the flock. Baaaa."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","I think I prefer it when you're quiet."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Cheery little karker, ain't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","You don't say? And I thought we were special."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","Oh? And Morrow otherwise seems so sentimental."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Really? I don't think I've heard you mention that before."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","And mine. I must be part Ogryn."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","Good for destroying evidence too, if you know what I mean."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Until someone hits the fuel tank, and then it's bad news for everyone nearby."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Better than me. I wasn't listening in the briefing."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Don't worry about it. I never do."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","Thanks for that. Cheered me right up, it did."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","But on the plus side, we could all die at any moment, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_a_01","Gotta admit, you lot are growing on me - and not like that fungus on the refectory pipes."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_a_02","I'm thinking we make a good team ... despite everything."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_a_03","We work well together ... I'm gonna miss you when an heretic puts your lights out."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","I was just thinking the same."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You're not bad yourself ... Most of the time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Creed's swagger..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Nope. That's nasty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","They're not so bad. Dumb little rotters."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","The way I see it, walking corpses are halfway where we want 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Will you stop snaffling all the medicae?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","I saw that! You didn't need the healing, so why use it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","Did that little scratch hurt? You wouldn't last a day in my old regiment."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Oh, look who's talking. I've seen how you've been carrying on."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","Oh, and you're such a model soldier, ain't ya? Karking bossyboots."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","Me too, Big Man. Then again, there is that outstanding warrant..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Ah. Home's wherever you can kip without fetching a slit throat."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","Are you trying to draw attention to us, Priest?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","Creed's swagger, not again…"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","All right, all right. Calm yourself."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","Right little firebrand, ain't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","Sssshh. Don't tempt fate."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","We're not done killing today, I've got a feeling ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Yeah. What can possibly go wrong?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","I agree. Cometh the hour, cometh the man, and all that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","Yet they've let their defences down..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Concentrate on the job, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","If I thump you, will that be real enough?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","I'm very real, thank you very much. At least, I think I am."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","Good to be happy in your work, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","Careful there, you've gone a tiny bit psychotic ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","Don't get distracted, we've a job to do."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Stay on mission, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","And if I don't comply, you'll melt me with your brain, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","Pretty sure I heard a threat in there. Anyone else?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","I dunno about that. We've still got walls, ceilings ... floors."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Don't be so karking gloomy. They can always rebuild."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","You shoot me plenty already with that little thing. Don't fancy a lascannon shot in the back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Maybe learn to aim with the one you've got, first?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","Stairs? No way. Wait ... are you scared?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","I'm not walking if I can ride. Hang on ... are you scared?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","You worry about spiritual rewards. I just try to survive till the next payday."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","We'll worry about that later, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","Maybe we get through the day first, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","Why don't you go first, while I go do something more important."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Hello? You do know they're still out there?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Sure. That won't give our position away at all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Magic, Big Man. Lots and lots of magic."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Speaking for myself, I'm labouring under a terrible, terrible curse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Oh come on, they're not that bad."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","I like them. Tangy, they are."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Ah, don't worry about it. I'm an equal opportunity sociopath."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","Poking around my head? Let me know if you find out where I left my lucky rock."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Don't be like that. You're still plenty smarter than the Priests."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","We can't all be geniuses. Can't all be pretty, neither. Not like me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","Sure. And there'll be dancing and flowers and booze flowing free ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","Take a good look around. Are you sure about that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_a_01","You reckon we'll ever get a day off? You know, a bit of leave?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_a_02","So, do we get leave around here? Time off for good behaviour?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_a_03","Do we ever get a break from this meat grinder? I could use some R&R."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","I karking well hope so. Killing's nice, but I could use a change of pace."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","Cold ale, friendly locals, a proper bed? That does sound like a good idea."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_a_01","Anyone fancy a bit of a sing-song?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_a_02","I feel like singing? Anyone else?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_a_03","You know what? A bit of singing will keep the spirits up."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","You really think this is a good time?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Yeah. Sure. Let's give away our position."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Just what we needed: a narcoleptic Ogryn..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Stay awake, you big lump."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_a_01","I hate karking snipers! Come over here and fight fair, you know?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_a_02","Seen a lot of sharpshooters down here. Cowardly business."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_a_03","Keep your eyes open for snipers. They get everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Ain't right, killing from a distance ... unless I'm doing it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","I prefer to do my killing eye to eye, so long as I'm winning."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","All right, all right. Keep your hair on!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Simmer down, would you? I'm getting tired just watching you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Being stealthy takes longer, and I'm bored already."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","Nothing wrong with a straight-up fight. Makes things nice and clear. Dead clear."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","You think this is bad, you should try sleeping in a barrack block. Curl your toes, it would."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","Ah, the honest stink of a campaigning soldier. It's healthy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Ooh! Ooh! Volunteering to be the turret gunner!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","Be nice to have some heavy ordnance, I can't lie."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Yeah, real lovely warzone you got here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","Shame if someone were to wreck the joint..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","I'm being a fantastic team player. You lot are the problem."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","Yeah. Follow my karking example. I'm awesome."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_a_01","Why turn traitor? I don't understand these Scabs."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_a_02","Sure, I've had my beefs with command, but I couldn't turn traitor like this lot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_a_03","I'm no angel, but I can't see myself joining the scabs. I mean ... look at them."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","I know. Apart from owt else, there's the smell ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","Raggedy bunch of 'aporths ain't they?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Yeah, you've the look of a true innocent."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","A real shame, casting an innocent like you into the cruel old world ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_a_01","Keep your eyes open for anything worth snaffling, would you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_a_02","Let me know if you see something worth selling, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_a_03","Got to be something around here worth a bit of scratch. Hand it over, and I'll cut you in."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","No way. Finders keepers. That's the rule."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","I see something, I'm keeping it. May the lightest fingers win."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","This is why I work best alone."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","Damn right!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","That's why I sleep with one eye open."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","And while you're watching us, who's watching your back?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Sir, yes, sir! ... Sir? Is that better, sir?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","Oh, stick it up your arse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Yeah. The Guard never retreats. It just holes up to get its breath back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","About that ... You never noticed that our glorious victories sometimes ain't neither of those things?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","So they ain't shiny? They work right. That's what matters."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","Who died and put you in charge? Mouthy karker."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","How long have you got?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","You want this lot to confess? Planning on staying a week, are you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Really? Better sharpen up my act, then."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","He does? I can't karking see him."
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","Always have to be the karking centre of attention, don't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","Settle down, it's just a scratch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_01","Hey! Get back here!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_02","Where are you going?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_03","We not good enough for you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_04","Was it something we said?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_05","Back to the squad, idiot!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_06","Get karking back here!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_07","Back here, karker!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_08","We stick together, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_09","Don't wander off!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__come_back_to_squad_10","I'm not dragging you back here!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","You know what I'd like to karking see? A squad of Space Marines, right here, right now."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","Just as well I'm awesome, isn't it? You stick with me, it'll all be fine. Promise."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","What's the deal with this Cicatrix Maledictum, anyway? You don't hear much trapped in stasis."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","Just my karking luck, that's what it is."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","This'll end in tears, mark my words. Ain't that right, sarge?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","It's a big place. Bit too showy for my tastes. And where's the karking sky?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","What's all this I keep hearing about another hive city? Why's there nothing in the logs?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","It's a tough one, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","The Beast won't die!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Try shooting it in the back!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","It's weak behind! Hit it there!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","I like your thinking!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Get its karking attention and I will!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","That explicator ... Not one for small talk, is she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Explicator Zola get you into this mess as well? She's a strange one."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","She's a laugh a minute, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","Not exactly friendly, is she? But who is around here?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","Not a woman I want to cross."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","Karking hardcase, is what she is. Don't even look at her strange."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Scuttlebutt says our karking explicator got her start on Atoma."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","I hear tell that Zola came from Atoma, back in the day."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","And what does that karking matter?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","You're saying that as if I should care."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","So she can be part of your club now, is that it? You must be happy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Oh no. You've made a friend. Did it hurt?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Well then, perhaps you'd be interested in buying this palace I've come into possession of. It's on Terra."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","That's nothing. I've got Lord Solar Macharius' favourite hat in my quarters. Honest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","So ... our pilot ... Got a mouth on her, doesn't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","Our pilot's not exactly one for discipline, is she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","Long as she flies straight ... I mean, she does fly straight, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","She speaks her mind. At least she's got one, unlike some I might mention."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","I like her. So you watch yourselves, alright?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","I like her more already ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","Go on, let's have it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","This ought to be good ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","Brunt? I owe him a beating myself."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","She should have said. I'd have held him down."

"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","Go on, smile. Won't hurt."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_02_01","Darktown Tarot. Our pilot. Do I need to draw you a picture."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_02_02","Played cards with our pilot. You don't want to know what I lost."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_02_03","That cheating dreg of a pilot! I'm going to kill her!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_02_04","Help me get even with our pilot, would you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","The plot thickens ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Another sob story, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_04_01","Got me drunk, then robbed me blind - and that's my job!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_04_02","Took me for everything! And now I have to ... No, you don't need to know ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_04_03","Don't trust her patter. Or her smile ... Definitely not her dealing!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_04_04","I'm the cardsharp around here, not her! She'll learn!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Die, you ugly karking brute!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","Come on! Die, you repulsive meat sack!"

"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Like I didn't karking know that!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","Better to leave the dead behind. And then you drink. Copiously."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","Guilty conscience? Or is he just a big old softy?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","If you're expecting sympathy, expect away."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","Oh, the poor, poor man. I don't think."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","Watch yourself. The sergeant-major's in a foul mood again."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","Steer clear of the sarge. He's in one of his moods."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","He's all mouth. Trust me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","You need to toughen up. He's all talk."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","I bet he got all weepy about his time with Yarrick, didn't he?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Is there anything more pathetic than a bitter old hero?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_01","Turns out old Morrow was at Xanatros. Who knew?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_02","I dig some digging around - cost me a couple of bottles of the good stuff. Morrow was at Xanatros."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_03","I've been hearing that Morrow was at Xanatros. Not that he talks about it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_01_04","Morrow was at Xanatros. Tough old devil, and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Xanatros? Well, well, well."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","Xanatros? I hope you're not expecting me to care."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_03_01","Karking genestealers, wasn't it? You can imagine the rest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_03_02","Genestealers. Genestealers everywhere, and Morrow walks out alive."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_03_03","Lost three Mordian regiments there, didn't they? Something about genestealers?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_03_04","Xanatros ... That was Genestealers, wasn't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","Let me guess. Morrow was working for the Inquisitor there and all?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","And Morrow was the Inquisitor's man, just like here on Atoma?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_01","You can bet that's the case."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_02","What else would he be doing there?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_03","Yeah. Wonder what happened to the rest of his team?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_05_04","Reckon you can count on it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow's been around a while. I heard he was in the Second War for Armageddon."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow looks young enough, but he's old. He was at Hades Hive, and that's centuries ago."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","His ship got lost in the Warp, didn't it? Lots do."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","So his ship got caught up in a Warp storm? So what?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","You know what? I don't care."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Do I care? Let me think. No. No I don't."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","Still can't get my head around that karking Tech-Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","That Tech-Priest gives me the creeps."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","She keeps looking at me as if I'm a bundle of spare parts awaiting reassignment."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","She keeps giving me funny looks. Me!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","Thank the Throne we don't have to deal with her that much, eh?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Just don't tell her we've be talking about her, alright?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","Oh yeah, and it's going splendidly so far, it is."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","And what fun it is. Fair makes me tingle to my boots."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","And where was the God-Emperor when I was neck deep in my own platoon's blood? Tell me that!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","I'd sooner put my faith in a bayonet and rifle, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","That's an odd gabble you've got yourself."
"loc_veteran_male_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Words. You need to use real words."

"loc_veteran_male_b__info_event_det_pack_b_02","That's not how you do it!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__info_event_det_pack_b_03","Should've let me do it!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__info_event_det_pack_b_04","It'll do, I suppose."
"loc_veteran_male_b__info_event_one_down_01","Karking got one!"

"loc_veteran_male_b__info_event_one_down_03","That's one!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__info_event_one_down_04","Good start!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__info_event_one_down_05","Yeah! Got one!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__info_extraction_response_01","Shift your feet!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__info_extraction_response_02","I'm not waiting for you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__intro_01","Another day, another set of useless bloody orders from some useless bloody karker sitting safe in planetary orbit while I’m down here in the mud, trying not to get my block knocked off. Just my karking luck. I mean, it wasn’t my fault that a few things went missing from the stores, now was it? If they were needed for the war effort, then the quartermaster would’ve locked the door or at least placed a guard, wouldn’t he? No … Wait … Come to think of it, there was a guard. And a lot of blood."

"loc_veteran_male_b__ladder_sighted_05","Do you see that ladder?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ladder_sighted_06","Got us a ladder!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ladder_sighted_07","Looks like a ladder!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ladder_sighted_08","Karking ladder!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ladder_sighted_09","Do we want that ladder?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__ladder_sighted_10","Get to the ladder!"

"loc_veteran_male_b__ledge_hanging_10","Not one word…"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_01","So this is what a real home looks like."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_02","It's not much, but it's more than I'm used to."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_response_01","Wonder if there's anything worth stealing ... I mean requisitioning."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_response_02","Ugh. I'd rather live out in the wastes."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_atrium_01","Not much of a place to live and die, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_atrium_02","Given the choice between this and stasis, I choose stasis every time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_b_response_b_01","Game faces on, you lot!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_b_response_b_02","So many worried faces! It'll be fine!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_collapse_01","Gantry's coming down!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_collapse_02","It's falling!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_corpse_01","Well, that's not exactly encouraging, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_corpse_02","Looks like a warning. Can we go back now?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_goo_01","Well, that's disgusting. Try not to lick the walls."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_goo_02","Oh look. Goo. How can this end badly?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_market_response_01","Shame we can't get down there. There'll be something worth rescuing."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_market_response_02","You sure we can't take a quick rummage through those stalls?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_security_01","Hello? Enforcers? We're about to do some very bad things ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_security_02","Not an enforcer in sight. Typical when there's work to be done!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_temple_01","Lovely ... We see all the nice places ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_temple_02","Interesting taste in decor ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_vista_01","Doesn't look much better from this side, neither."
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_vista_02","Look at that view. Not exactly glamorous, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_void_01","I hope no one's scared of the dark!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__level_hab_block_void_02","Dark around here, ain't it? Let's bring some light and fire!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_01","Grenade!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_02","Grenade!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_03","Lovely! A grenade!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_04","A grenade? Lovely!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_05","Grenade? We can use that!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_06","That a grenade? Nice."
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_07","Someone grab that karking grenade!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_08","Looks like a grenade!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_09","We've a grenade over here!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_grenade_10","Who wants this grenade?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_01","Medicae!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_02","Medicae station!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_03","Healer's terminal!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_04","Med station!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_05","Med terminal!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_06","Meds? There's a code for this, too…"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_07","What's the code? To Hel with it! Meds!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_08","Get yourselves patched up!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_09","Get some healing!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__look_at_healthstation_10","Heal up! Can't have you weak lot dying on me!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_b_01","And... they all as smart as you, Big Man?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","They all big, dumb and eager to please I take it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_c_01","Ever seen Feral Ogryn fight? Trust me, you'd rather not."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_c_02","Feral Ogryns are real. Once saw one bite a Ratling's head off for looking at him funny."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_a_01","Maybe we can get some Sniper support? Ratling, if we're lucky."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_a_02","Sniper's what we need. None better than a Ratling."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_a_03","Ratling Snipers are the best shots in the Guard. Could use one here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_a_04","Always wanted to be a sniper. Just couldn't outshoot them damn Ratlings..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_b_01","Good shots, yeah... When they aren't skiving off."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_b_02","Lazy little gits. Good for one shot if you're lucky."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_c_01","Thieving sewer-rats, the lot of 'em. Good thieves, mind. Kind you can count on."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_c_02","Lock your valuables up when Ratlings are around, s'all I'll say."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_01","Specially in the Guard. Chews 'em up, spits 'em out."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_02","If they can fight and die, we'll find a use for them."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","Served with a Beastman unit once. Gave me the creeps."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","Ratlings I can deal with. Beastmen though... [Ugh]"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_two_b_01","Really? This is what occupies your mind?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_two_b_02","Trust a Priest to sweat the important stuff..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_two_c_01","Only thing that matters is whether they're with us or against us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","Creed's swagger, what does it matter?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","It's boots on the ground that gets battles won."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","I'd be happy just with an APC to save our legs..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","Leman Russ Eradicator would be my choice. Boom. Heretics gone."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","How about a few Sentinels? Make short work of this lot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_01","Back in the Guard we'd have had more backup, and a lot more guns."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_02","Few more guns wouldn't go amiss. Wonder what the old platoon is up to?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_03","Outgunned behind enemy lines. Times like this I miss the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_04","Never thought I'd miss the Guard, but here we are."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","It's all the rules and regulations I can do without."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","Nothing more stirring than a Rough Rider charge, I'll grant you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","Best thing about the Guard is that there's always someone else to blame."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","Too many officers for my liking. We've got it good here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Threat of a boltpistol round to the back of the head is quite the motivator..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","Sadistic karkers, the lot of 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Black hearts to match their black coats. Can't trust 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Annoyingly good in a scrap though. I wouldn't test them."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","Happily they were all drowned out by the explosions."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","All they're good for is last rites."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Better a preacher than a commissar, I s'pose."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_four_b_01","Really? Reckon I signed on with the wrong crew."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_four_b_02","Nothing wrong with that. Shows initiative. Daring. A nose for plunder."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_four_c_01","You see, that sounds like a better life than the one I'm stuck in."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_four_c_02","Wouldn't mind being a pirate, if the opportunity arose."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_a_01","The shipmistress has a fine scowl, doesn't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_a_02","So, the shipmistress. Not exactly a sunbeam, is she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_a_03","Have you seen Brahms yet. Looks like I feel when I'm hungover."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_a_04","Crossed paths with the shipmistress earlier. Nearly shrivelled me on the spot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_b_01","She loves this ship, and she's not happy Grendyl's got it in harm's way."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_b_02","Grendyl's got the Mourningstar in the thick of things, and she loves this ship."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_c_01","If I know one thing about life aboard ship, it's ""don't cross the skipper""."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_one_c_02","Mind how you speak to her. Don't want to find yourself floating home, do you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_three_b_01","She reminds me of my old colonel. He never had a ray of sunshine in him either."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_three_b_02","At least she's in charge of something. Not like us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_three_c_01","High born folk always have angst. It's their way of pretending suffering."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_three_c_02","Well, however bad Brahms has it, we've got it worse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_two_b_01","You're feeling brave today. Word always gets back to the skipper on ships like this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_two_b_02","You should tell Brahms directly. And I should watch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_two_c_01","What's wrong with trading with aliens, anyway? I mean, so long as they're not shooting at you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_brahms_two_c_02","It's not like trade does any harm. Treaties are always open to renegotiation, if your guns are big enough."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_four_c_01","Tough karkers though. Feel no pain."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_four_c_02","Decay makes 'em karking hard to kill."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_a_01","Based on the shrines, them things the heretics worship seem a lot like gods..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_a_02","So these ""Ruinous Powers""... Definitely not gods? We sure?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_a_03","Karking heretics think they're worshipping gods. Maybe they're right."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_a_04","Heretics think the Chaos powers are actual gods. Who's to say they're wrong..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_b_01","Never killed a god. Fancy a crack at it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_b_02","Karkers seem mad to me, but what do I know?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Some of 'em literally shout ""Blood for the Blood God"" while they run at you. Mad karkers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_one_c_02","Something must drive 'em to carve their own flesh and turn on their own."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_three_b_01","Makes sense I suppose. Daemons gotta live somewhere, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_three_b_02","So, when we make Warp jumps we're... visiting Daemon-land? You've gotta be kidding..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_three_c_01","Let's not start talking about dreams, right? Private, ain't they."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Fine. There's a Realm of Chaos. I call it Hel, and that's where I'm sending the heretics."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Seen 'em with my own eyes. Big karkers. Spikes and skulls - dead giveaway."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_two_b_02","Ain't no doubt they're out there. Better hope we don't meet one of the karkers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Heard of some acting as reavers. Small warbands that can strike anywhere... any time..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_chaos_two_c_02","If you ever see one of the karkers, call in heavy support, or run like hel."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_four_b_01","It's a big karking problem is what it is."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_four_b_02","The thing that's gonna destroy us all, if you believe some people."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_four_c_01","Wish there was a way to get some payback for Cadia."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Don't reckon they'll ever stop fighting over the Cadian Gate."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_one_a_01","Daemons are Warp-creatures. Won't see any down here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_one_a_02","Ha! Ain't afraid of no Daemons, least not in realspace."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_one_a_03","Least we shouldn't run into any Daemons outside of Warp space."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_one_a_04","Never seen a Daemon outside Warp space. We're safe here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Wouldn't be so sure..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_one_b_02","I dunno, I've heard some stories..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_one_c_01","Next you'll be saying that Grey Knights are real..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_three_b_01","Creed's swagger... You're not gonna get possessed are you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_three_b_02","You start acting all Daemonic, I'll put you down."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_three_c_01","This is why we don't tolerate rogue psykers, see!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_three_c_02","Nothing more dangerous than a rogue psyker."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_two_b_01","Still can't believe it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Daemons... on Terra. Unbelievable."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_two_c_01","If they'd reached the Eternity Gate, the game would've been up."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_daemons_two_c_02","Space Marines saved the day again, so I'm told."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","Careful, Big Man, that's a touchy subject."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","That's the question, ain't it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","Let's have some quiet time, shall we... Before we get executed."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","Probably best not to question it. You'll live longer."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_01","Should call in the Battle Sisters; that'd sort these heretics out."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_02","Need some Sisters of Battle to sort out these heretics."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_03","If things get much worse, we should call in the Sisters of Battle."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_04","What we need down here is the Sisters of Battle."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","Really? Why not get a Space Marine company in while you're at it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Chance'd be a fine thing."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","Might as well just declare Atoma Exterminatus. Result'd be the same."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Mind you, I've always wanted to see a Penitus Engine in action..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Seen enough Missionaries in the Guard. Funny in the head."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","Don't get me started on them lot..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","Judge, jury and executioner. Least they think they are."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","Surprisingly good xenos-fighters, I'll give em that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","Don't hold your breath, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","I'd rather just make it through the day, thanks."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","They sit outside Administratum control... Always seemed suspicious to me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Ain't no glory in death, no matter how you go."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","If it's got tentacles, or an extra head, just shoot it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","That's the problem, Big Man; it's not always obvious."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","If in doubt, assume the worst."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","If they run, they're probably guilty of something. Easy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","Better toughen up, Witch, and quick."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","This job's not for the faint-hearted."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","If they weren't guilty, they wouldn't confess."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Good to have a few on our side, just in case."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","How'd you tell the good kind from the bad kind?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","When a psyker goes ""pop"", just gotta hope they don't take you with 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","Yeah, let's hope we don't meet any of the karkers down here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","How do I explain it...? Big Guilliman smash Chaos real good. Got it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","Guilliman's pet project, ain't it. Big fella loves a good crusade."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","The Indomitus Crusade fleet is huge. Like... really huge."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","Don't think anyone's ever assembled a warfleet so big. Impressive."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_01","Never had much love for Cadia, but wouldn't wish that on anyone."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_02","I'll be honest, when Cadia fell I thought it was game over."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_03","Never thought I'd live to see Cadia fall."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_04","Cadia... gone. Doesn't seem real."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","They say the death toll was so high it birthed the Great Rift. How's that even work?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","Seems karking impossible."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","Things must be bad if Guilliman is back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","They say Abaddon's armada was endless. Somehow the navy turned 'em back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","You all had the nightmares, right? The same nightmare..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Even I felt it, and I don't have a psychic bone in my body."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","Hear the Emperor needs more soul-bindings these days. Good timing, I guess."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","Karking witches are nothing but trouble..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","I'm just glad I'm Terran-side, after what I've heard."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","Hear they got themselves all kinds of xenos trouble in the Dark Imperium."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","But that's what Guilliman is fighting for. Reunification."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Better hope the Indomitus Crusade is successful, or millions of worlds will be lost."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Yeah. The Mourningstar's proper crowded."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","I've given up counting. So many new faces. So few of them worth remembering."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","Long as they keep their thieving hands to themselves ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","The hard part's gonna be finding out which ones are lousy at Darktown Whist before word gets around."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_01","Who even is Grendyl, do you reckon? I've never seen more than that hologram."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_02","Grendyl's keeping secrets ... that much is a dead cert."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_03","I doubt Grendyl's telling us everything. Or even a part of everything."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_a_04","Grendyl loves being mysterious, eh? Show off."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","I don't trust someone if I've not seen their eyes."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","Hiding behind that hologram's not exactly a way to win trust."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","Let's just hope we're not being set up ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","I feel like a skeg-rat in a maze, and I don't like it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Probably got other stuff going on."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","Running some racket elsewhere, I shouldn't wonder."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","Rannick and Zola seem to have things in hand here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","It's not like we're not short of Grendyl's ... underlings."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","What does it matter? Or are you planning to refuse service if you're wrong?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Long as he's not a maniac, I couldn't much care either way."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Why the speculation? Grendyl could be a chatty servitor for all we know?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","I'm not sure Grendyl's even real. Could all be smoke and mirrors on Rannick's part."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_four_b_01","Yeah. Clear as mud, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_four_b_02","You're having a laugh, ain't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Ah, the Ogryn's going off the tone, not the words. Like I do with Morrow."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_four_c_02","Well, so long as Big Man's happy, where's the harm?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_a_01","Hadron's a bit disturbing, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_a_02","Hadron ... Anyone else a bit creeped out by that voice of hers?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_a_03","I always feel like the Tech-Priest's taking inventory whenever she looks at me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_a_04","I get the shivers whenever the Tech-Priest looks in my direction."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I know what you mean. I'm not sure she's used to people."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_b_02","She does look at me funny, now that you mention it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_c_01","I reckon she wants to put a machine in my brain, and I'm not having that!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Just don't let her near me while I'm sleeping, you hear?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Picking away at secrets, were you? Naughty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Want to watch yourself. Snooping like that gets you shot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_three_c_01","I wish I could read minds. It'd keep the boredom at bay."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Don't ever change, Witch. You make me look like a good soldier. Me!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_two_b_01","I don't know ... She still sounds pretty human. Not like some of the rest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Maybe ... Though most of the old Tech-Priests sound more ... machine-y."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_two_c_01","I'll not make old bones. I guarantee that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hadron_two_c_02","I can't quibble. Me, I should've died years ago."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","I saw that. Don't think it's the life for me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","From what I hear, them folks don't live long. Karking death sentence."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Trust me, you don't want anything to do with her."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Keep your distance, that's what I reckon. Mug's game."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_01","That Commodore's a piece of work, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_02","The Commodore's not someone you want to cross, trust me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_03","I'd think twice before swindling Commodore Hallowette."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_a_04","I'm gonna take care to keep the Commodore sweet, if you follow?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","Go on, spill. I always like a cautionary tale."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Oh, gossip. I like a bit of gossip."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","Brunt walks in mortal fear of her. I don't want to know why."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","Brunt's terrified of her - you can see it in the big lug's face."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Maybe she wants to haggle? I'd certainly like to see you try."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Quit karking moaning. Woman's just trying to hustle. Nowt wrong with that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Someone's always profiting off the likes of us. Just accept it. You'll be happier."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","Dog eat dog, even aboard the Mourningstar, and Hallowette has pretty big teeth."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Don't take this wrong, but I don't come to you for character references."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","So you don't like her? I do."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","What about the fact the crew are terrified of her? Did you notice that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","The crew don't have a bad word to say about her. They just sort ... go quiet and stride off. Odd."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Powdered, soft-handed karkers. You wouldn't like 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Somebody has to keep the scum in line, right? They live up top."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Only way lowborns get to the spire is as sport in a fighting pit."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","If only you saw what these Highborns call ""entertainment""..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_a_02","Life's tough in the lower hive. S'why there's so many gangers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_a_04","Karking hive gangs..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Crime around here is out of control."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Never mind the grunts. It's the bosses you gotta watch out for."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Gets worse the lower down the hive you go."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Get in with the right sort and there's creds to be made... So I'm told."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Spiresiders don't do too bad. Downsiders are another story."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","You don't survive in the lower hive by staying on the straight and narrow. Trust me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","The gambling's good in Tertium. Or so I'm told..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Hear they distil a decent bottle of joiliq in Tertium. Not that I partake, you understand."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","We're not here to save souls. We're here to protect vital resources."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Why do you think we're here, Priest? Can't let the enemy control vital assets."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","It's gonna be a long road getting the manufactorums up and running again."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","Be a while before the metalfabs are back to capacity, if ever."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Think they'd ring the Bell of Lost Souls for us?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Trust me, the Bell of Lost Souls ain't ringing for us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Like they'll even notice us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_four_c_02","In my experience, heroes get you killed."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_one_a_01","You ever think about Terra? Wonder what it's like."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_one_a_03","Heard the boss going on about Terra. What do you think it's like there?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_one_a_04","Reckon Terra is all it's cracked up to be?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Never seen it. Never even met anyone who's seen it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_one_b_02","Who cares? Likes of us will never get to see it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_one_c_01","Be good to know what we're fighting for, I guess."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Reckon we'd just end up disappointed."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_three_b_01","Without the Military Tithe, I wouldn't be here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_three_b_02","I got tithed. Most Guard did. Just how it is."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_three_c_01","Administratum quill-pushers gotta justify their jobs."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_three_c_02","I pity the governor who doesn't pay up."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_two_b_01","How come every one I'm assigned to is a karking cesspit?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Doubt they'll miss this one, push comes to shove."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_two_c_01","They're mostly flattened after we're done."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Always leave 'em in worse shape than they started."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","Saw a Death Cultist once. [Shudder / creeped-out noise]"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","Budget might stretch to a Death Cultist... Wouldn't advise it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","Wouldn't mind some of their gear though. Vindicare rifles... [whistles]"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","They get the best wargear, I'll give 'em that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_a_01","Wonder how you'd Exterminatus Atoma? Theoretically speaking."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_a_03","Exterminatus... That's what I'd like to see."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","I'd go for virus bombs. Leave the manufactorums intact."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Reckon Life-Eater virus bombs would do the trick."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Never gonna happen. Atoma's too valuable."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Be crazy to blow up all these manufactorums."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","Comes in handy... now and then."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Nice being on this side of the law for a change."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","See, I never realised the Lex Imperialis was... open to interpretation."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","Never much cared for the Lex Imperialis anyway."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Creed's swagger... Here we go again."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","Ordo Xenos would've been my first choice. Honest fighting."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","Lot of sneaking about though. Not like in the Ordo Xenos."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","They say it sits on a mountain of machinery... Who knows?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","How does anything work? Best ask an Enginseer."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","If it went wrong, nobody'd know how to fix it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","Let's just hope it keeps working, or we all kark it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_a_01","Solar Macharius... Now there was a soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_a_03","You all know the legend of Solar Macharius? Great soldier. Great man."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_a_04","All the lessons we could've learned from Solar Macharius... So much forgotten."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","So many worlds reclaimed. Made the Imperium what it is today."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Ah yeah... The voyages of Macharius and the Lord of Light!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","Died of jungle fever, after such a glorious campaign."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","Survived all them wars just to die of fever."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","True. All our best wargear comes from the Age of Technology."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","Might be onto something there, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","These history lessons gonna help us right now? Didn't think so."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","Focus on the here and now. Might be dead tomorrow."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","That when Goge Vandire almost brought down the Ministorum?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","I think things are quite bad enough right now, thanks."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","The Adeptus Custodes took their sweet time bringing down Vandire."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","They say the Adeptus Custodes were slow to act. Still not lived it down."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_four_b_01","Easy said. Harder proved."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_four_b_02","I thought we all were. I thought that was the point?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_four_c_01","There's no one better placed to run a few scores and all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_four_c_02","Bet he's running a racket. Wonder if he wants some help?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_a_01","I'm a patient soul, but Melk really winds me up."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_a_02","Melk'd test the patience of a saint, and I'm no saint."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_a_03","Wish we could harness Melk's arrogance as a weapon. War'd be over in three days."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_a_04","Not sure I can take much more of Melk. Insufferable karker."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_b_01","That would be Sir Darius Melk, Holder of the Endless March and Warden of the Crux Mortem?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_b_02","I don't know a ""Melk"". But I do know a Most Beneficent Lord Darius Melk. That him?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_c_01","Oh ... stick it where the sun don't shine ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_one_c_02","That's right. Laugh it up. I'll not forget."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_three_b_01","Really? I knew I liked him."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_three_b_02","Is that so? He doesn't look the sort."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_three_c_01","I'll have to ply him with liquor, see what slithers loose."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_three_c_02","I'm sure there's a way to exploit - I mean - empathise with the poor old coot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_two_b_01","Really? Perish the thought."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_two_b_02","Now, why ever would he do that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_two_c_01","[Laughter]"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_melk_two_c_02","Oh, the look on your face!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_four_b_01","Had that happen to a mate of mine. Commissar shot him through the eye and burned the remains."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_four_c_01","You know, I don't think I've ever seen him eat ... Maybe he's metal all the way through?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_four_c_02","Don't know how you can believe it. I mean, think of that nice welcoming manner of his ... Oh ... wait ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_a_01","So the story goes, Morrow was part of nobbling old Huron Blackheart, back in the day."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_a_02","Got another nutty rumour doing the rounds - claims that Morrow fought the Tyrant of Badab."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_a_03","Got another bit of rumour for you: Morrow was at Badab. Huron Blackheart and all that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_a_04","I heard that Morrow fought at Badab. You know, against Lugft... Lufgt ... Huron Blackheart."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Sounds like another tall tale to me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Pull the other one, would you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_c_01","The more I hear around here, the less I believe."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Don't worry ... If you like stories, you're gonna love some of mine."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Yeah. And I like a good story as much as the next sucker."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_three_b_02","I like a bit of mystery. In moderation."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_three_c_01","Doesn't make the man more impressive, that's the main thing. Just makes someone a liar."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_three_c_02","Bah! The Mourningstar runs on rumour. Try not to worry about it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Load of rot! That's centuries back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Does he look two hundred and fifty plus years old to you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_two_c_01","The Myth of Morrow, eh? I'm not signing up for that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Even if that were true, why's he still alive and everyone else dead, eh?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Packs a punch, despite her size. Can't say fairer than that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Right little scrapper, ain't she? Lots of odd tech hidden away too."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","She ain't exactly standard pattern, from what I've seen ... not that I care."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Bears her scars well. Let's just hope they don't split and spit us out into the void."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_four_b_01","You expect folk like him to get their hands dirty? He'd faint at the sight of blood."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Gets his jollies sending others in to die, don't he?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Wouldn't mind seeing him in harm's way. Good for morale. Namely, mine."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_four_c_02","If we ever see him planetside, we'll know it's gotten real nasty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_a_01","Whenever Rannick looks at me, I feel like he's sizing me up for ready burial."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_a_02","Rannick always seems surprised I'm still alive. Hurtful."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_a_03","Rannick's distant fellow, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_a_04","Never really sure where I stand with Rannick, if I'm honest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Having the Inquisitorial Seal so close gives a man swagger, and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_b_02","He's arrogant, sure, but he's got much to be arrogant about."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Thinks he's better than us, don't he? But you've gotta wonder where Grendyl found him."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_one_c_02","Long as he stays out of my way, we're golden."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_three_b_01","Certainly filling out those boots of his. Might be getting too big for them, in fact."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Got the look of an ambitious man. Wonder how that's going down with his master?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_three_c_01","I still don't trust him. I don't like his eyes."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_three_c_02","So what if he's going somewhere. You and me? We're going nowhere but an unmarked grave."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_two_b_01","So he doesn't bow and scrape like you do? Everyone worships in their own way."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_two_b_02","I reckon that's the Emperor's business. Not yours."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_two_c_01","He's still the boss. That's all that matters."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_rannick_two_c_02","He's in charge. We're in the ranks. You want to pick a fight with him, well ... it was almost nice knowing you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_a_01","Don't much care for servitors. Creepy dead eyes and flat voices."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_a_02","I wish there weren't so many servitors on the Mourningstar. Creepy little karkers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_a_03","Servitors are always watching, everywhere I karking go."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_a_04","Servitors ... I can't stand the nasty little karkers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Nasty little tech-zombies. All watching with their dead eyes."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_b_02","Can you not smell the grave whenever one lurches past?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_c_01","You want to be careful. Misbehave, and Hadron'll hollow you out. You'll be one of them."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_servitors_one_c_02","As long as no one's eyeing me up for surgery ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Dunno, but I bet the Mechanicus has a hand in it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","Experiments. Dark experiments."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Wouldn't mind some power armour though, eh?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","Bet that power armour helps a bit, too."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_01","Where's the karking Space Marines when you need 'em?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_02","About time the boss called in some Space Marines."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_03","Karking Space Marines should be taking care of this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_a_04","How many have to die before we call in some Space Marines?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Space Marines? Here? You'll be lucky."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","You ever seen one close up? Inspiring, but... terrifying."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Imagine if they sent the Blood Angels... Things'd get messy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","They say one Space Marine's worth a hundred soldiers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","I'll believe it when I see it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","Yeah, yeah. Next you'll be saying Cadia didn't burn."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Now, Rogal Dorn... there was a Primarch."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Time'll tell if he makes a difference."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","Just a load of squad designations, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","You should really get out more, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","It split the Space Marine legions into chapters... big deal."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Don't know why you lot worship scraps of old parchment."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","He's a dead guy. So... Not great."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","Been dead ten thousand years. Can't be much of a looker."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Maybe we'll find out for sure in the next life."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","Stow it. Best not tempt His wrath, eh."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_a_01","Always wondered what the voice of the Emperor sounds like."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_a_02","Does the Emperor give orders? Or is he just sort of... psychic."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_a_03","S'pose the Emperor must talk, right? Else how do we know his will?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_a_04","Ever wonder how the Emperor gives his orders?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","He don't speak. Just sort of... thinks it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He's the original psyker. Don't need to speak."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","His orders come down from the High Lords of Terra, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","Probably some karking psychic malarkey."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Yeah, don't like to think about that too much."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","I mean... Does he literally eat them? Nasty..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","No survival without fire. No fire without kindling."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","Survival of the fittest. Can't all be Astropaths."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","Yeah... When my time comes, just put me out of my misery."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","Golden Throne's just a fancy prison if you ask me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","If he's planning on coming back, he's taking his sweet time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","I put my faith in what I can see with my own eyes."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Try not to think about it, Big Man. It'll give you nightmares."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Ship go poof. Move real fast. Pop out somewhere else. Get it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Used to plug psykers into the engines. Don't think they do that anymore..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Remember when they just plugged psykers into the engines? Good times."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_01","[Ugh] My insides still haven't settled after my last Warp jump..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_02","I hate Warp jumps. Turn me inside out every time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_03","Karking hate Warp travel. My last jump was rough."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_a_04","Know what I hate most? Warp travel."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","Creed's swagger... Just pray we never get lost in the Warp."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","Imagine getting lost in the Warp... [Ugh]"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","Short, controlled jumps. That's the secret."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","If a jump's more than five light years, it's time to worry."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Friend of mine back home used to be younger than me. Not any more."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Least time only flows forward, right? Right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","Explains how so many generals have been around for so long."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","S'pose we should be thankful for Navigators."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","Warp entities, yeah? Always there, in the corner of your eye."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Warp entities. Give me the karking creeps."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Long as the Gellar Fields hold, we'll be safe. Probably."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","Chin up - this is why we have Gellar Fields."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Get away! You're funny in the head."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Oh aye? Can't say I saw that coming."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","I suppose as surprises go this one's harmless."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","She probably thinks he's some sort of pet."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_01","Not sure I like that psyker they've got doing the training."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_02","The training psyker ... She's a cold one."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_03","Can't help but shudder whenever Sefoni speaks to me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_a_04","The Psykhanium? That's weird, but I can cope with it. It's Sefoni's voice that does for me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","Gives me goosebumps, she does, and not the good kind."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","It's reached the point where even looking at her sets me shuddering."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","I wish there was another way of training ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","I'd prefer training with live targets. Orks. Anything!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","If you want me for your little club, I politely decline."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Not really my idea of a confidant, if I'm honest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Have you noticed how it's always cold when she's nearby?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Temperature drops whenever she's close. Don't say you've not noticed."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","If you didn't need so much training it wouldn't be a problem, would it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","Getting hot and bothered won't change anything."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Training's training. Just count the hours 'till it's done."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","I'm not sure anyone cares if you're not enjoying yourself."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","You wait until we come under fire. That'll keep your eyes open."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","You ain't seen nothing yet. Wait until the heretics start sending up interceptors."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Ah, give over. It's not like complaining will change anything."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","You'll get used to it. Everyone does ... eventually."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_war_end_b_01","Sure. Just got to put the boot in harder than the other lot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_war_end_b_02","You never bet against the Guard, Big Man. You know that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_war_end_c_01","Makes no difference to me. I was born for this!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_war_end_c_02","Long as there's ammo, I'll keep fighting."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Creed's swagger, who's been telling the big 'un about hybrids?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Shouldn't listen to that stuff, Big Man. Give you nightmares."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_four_c_01","The longer they go undiscovered, the more human they look. Creepy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_four_c_02","Where there's hybrids, there's a Broodlord nearby. Nasty great karkers..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_a_01","You've all fought xenos, right? Or is it just me?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_a_02","Not sure what's worse: Heretics or xenos."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_a_03","Anybody else miss sticking it to the xenos scum?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_a_04","Could be worse. Could be facing xenos."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_b_01","I hear you. Least you can take an alien down once you know how."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Yeah, just give me something I can shoot, you know?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_c_01","I dunno. I faced an Ork charge once, wouldn't fancy doing it again."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_one_c_02","I'd rather be here than staring down a greenskin charge."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_three_b_01","I hear they take aliens along on Ordo Xenos missions."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_three_b_02","Reckon there's more alien tech in the Imperium than you might think."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_three_c_01","You must have heard of Xenarch weapons? Worth a karking fortune..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_three_c_02","I'll use whatever you put in my hands, long as it does the job."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_two_b_01","Fast karkers though. They die easy, if you can hit 'em!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_two_b_02","Fighting the karkers is like trying to grapple water."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_two_c_01","Just be thankful there aren't many of 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_xenos_two_c_02","I'm just glad they don't have numbers on their side, or we'd be history."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_four_b_01","Ah, she's a big softy really ... Don't tell her I said that, mind."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_four_b_02","Don't need to tell me that. I've seen her work first hand."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_four_c_01","Don't know why anyone's surprised, really."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_four_c_02","Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can all stop sucking up to her now."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_a_01","If you ask me, Zola's wound tighter than most Commissars."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_a_02","That explicator's a laugh a minute, ain't she?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_a_03","Tough crowd, that explicator. I've seen more smiles in a mass grave."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_a_04","That explicator needs to ease up. Like ... a lot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_b_01","Her sort's all show. Soft as rotten fruit inside, I bet."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_b_02","Aye. Could be worse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_c_01","As long as she doesn't go funny, it'll work out."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_one_c_02","That sort snaps too easy. Want to place a wager on how soon?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_three_b_01","Simple folk don't last long at the front lines."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_three_b_02","Gotta have a bit of gumption to stay alive around here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_three_c_01","Ah, she's all right. Give or take."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_three_c_02","Don't wish her away. At least she's friendly. Sometimes ... At least, I think so."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_two_b_01","There's more to faith than your showy nonsense, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_two_b_02","The book of regs is my only deity. Or at least the loopholes therein."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_two_c_01","Eh ... Whatever works for you, and all that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__lore_zola_two_c_02","Long as Zola keeps a clear head and doesn't get us killed, I'm happy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Got what we came for!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Come here, you little karker!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_alarm_01","It's like we rang a dinner gong!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_alarm_02","Where's the karking alarm shut-off?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","Karking locked down ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","Don't think we're moving that door without something big and angry."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","I'm not much of one for reading. Wouldn't know where to start in here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Looks ordered enough, but I'm not buying it. I bet they can't find anything in here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Any clues as to who the Inquisitors hoping to catch out? You can tell me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Pick up a rock, find a traitor. The bigger the rock, the more traitors."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","Not a place for people, this. Scribes aside, it's servitors all the way down."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Can you imagine being here when it's quiet - half-dead cyborgs shushing you to silence?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","So ... if we're the good guys, why do we spend so much time traipsing around sewers?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","I hope your boots are waterproof ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Shame we're doing it this way. I always wanted to drive a chuffing train ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Are you sure I can't drive the train? Go on. Be a sport."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Oh, you're no fun. Did anyone ever tell you that?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","You're a killjoy. Plain and simple."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Oi, Tech Priest. What are you in for anyway? How did you end up on the Mourningstar?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You think you're better than us, don't you Tech Priest?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Come again?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","You what?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","This support team had better be quick off the mark."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Our support team know we're all at the target?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","We won't need them anyway. You'll see."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","And who says we can't get it karking done without them? Precisely."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","All this activity! Makes me tired just looking at it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","I do like work. I could watch it all day."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Are we going round in circles? Feels like it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","I give up! This place is a karking maze!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Let's hope we don't meet whatever made that hole!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Looks like someone made a stand here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Look at these toy soldiers. Oi lads! Want to come where the real fighting is?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","Look at this lot. A heavy sneeze'd take them all out!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","So, have we seen the last of the Water Cartel?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","The Water Cartel's taken a real pasting, haven't they?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Sounds like you're holding a grudge. I can get behind that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","You've a nasty streak, explicator. It suits you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Gangs are normally close-knit. Must have slipped up for the heretics to take 'em over."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","No easy task taking over a hive gang from inside. Trust me, I know."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","They were sloppy, that's all. Needed a real maestro in command, if you know what I mean?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Get lax, get whacked. Got it. This job's a real eye opener."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","You been running errands for the Inquisitor long, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","From the Torrent's slums to the ranks of the Holy Inquisition? Not bad, explicator."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Fine. Keep your secrets. I bet they're dead boring anyway."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Oooh. Hit a nerve, maybe? Makes me want to keep digging."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Shame the cartel's been wiped out. Might have been a better billet than this …"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Not much difference between cartel and enforcers, if you ask me. Different uniforms is all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","You don't suppose they actually … eat some of that, do you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","I bet the Guard do fine recruiting around here. I'd rather eat a bullet than whatever it is they're sifting."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","You see the state of those hab blocks? This place just gets better and better."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","Desirable location. Lovely views. Charming neighbours. It's a wonder more folk don't live here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Looks like there's been another shootout. I wonder who won this round?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","They've been fighting again. You know it might be for entertainment, not to see who's in charge."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_shanty_01","What a mess! I've seen some crummy places in my time, but this is something special."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_shanty_02","Lovely. Just the kind of place that makes you want to put down roots, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_water_course_01","Take my advice, don't go for a dip over the side of the bridge."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cartel_water_course_02","Look at that river. Not exactly a spot for skinny dipping, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Elevator's on the karking way! Let's have a kill competition before it arrives!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Elevator's gonna take a while! Get ready to fight!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Was I imagining all those nice, big comms arrays on the Mourningstar?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","Karking busywork, this. The Mourningstar could send this away in a heartbeat."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","The uniform changes, but that's it. Always neck deep in dung."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","I'll look forward to getting a knife in the back. I could use the kip."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","So ... where are we sending this transmission, exactly?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","Transmission going out to another of Grendyl's mates?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Yeah, yeah, yeah. You enjoy your secrets."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","It's okay. I don't care anyway, long as I'm paid."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","What's in the transmission? Go on. You can tell me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","The transmission's got to include something juicy for all this trouble."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Didn't think it was Grendyl's recipe book."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Wouldn't want to read it. Sounds like a parade of numbers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Suicide party, reporting for duty!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Looks like another day of death or glory, hold the glory."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_way_in_01","Ain't nothing special, but this should get us inside!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_complex_way_in_02","Aha! This looks like our way in: servitors, traders and covert strike teams only."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Any chance this place'll be restored to full function? You know, if there's not a kaboom."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","This all looks pretty beat up to me. Reckon they can fix it when we're done?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Yeah … That's what I was thinking as well. Every last word."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Oi, tech priest! You need to use shorter words!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Saving the manufactorum's one thing, but it'll still need workers, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","We can save the karking building, but the heretics killed all the workers."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That's what I like about you, tech priest: all that warm humanity you've got sloshing around inside."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Have a little respect. Those are people you're talking about!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Lot of karking bother for one tank factory. Is it really that important?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Is one tank factory really that important? Why are we down here?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Well, I'd hate to be doing all this for no karking reason."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Better get to it. I've a reputation as a karking miracle worker to consider."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_heat_01","Bad enough that we're walking into an enormous bomb, but does it have to be so hot?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_heat_02","Karking hel! I hate the heat at the best of times, but this is something else."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_leaving_01","We've not died in an explosion. That feels like a win."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_leaving_02","No kaboom today. I can live with that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","It's a fair old drop, ain't it? You could lose a hab block in here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Lot of stairs ahead. My poor old aching legs…"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Overseer's Office. Finally! Coolant Control had better be close."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","I'm karking melting. Don't suppose you want to carry me to Coolant Control?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Leman Russ armour plates? Could use one of those tanks right now, couldn't we?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Wonder if old Rannick would let us have a Leman Russ … you know, if we asked nicely?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Workers have converted this place to a makeshift hab. Rather them than me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Look at those bunks! No way to live, is it? I'll take my chances on the front lines."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_deception_01","Bit of a dirty trick, uploading false intel … but I like dirty tricks."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_deception_02","Why are we bothering with false intel? We should plant a bomb, blow the whole thing to pieces!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","[Shudder] Gives me the creeps. Like being up before a Commissar."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Won't see me weeping over a ruined courthouse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Typical enforcers. Never around when they're needed."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Hard to believe there were ever any enforcers around here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Always got to look after number one. No other way to live."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","You prop yourselves up on lawkeepers, you'll always fall over."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","I bet you're no stranger to these Blocks, explicator? Go on. Spill."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","These are your old stomping grounds, aren't they explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Thing is, you've got me more interested than ever."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","I'm starting to think you and I might have a lot in common."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Never thought I'd be breaking into prison. Breaking out? Been there, done that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","This is a backwards kind of jailbreak, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Oh yeah. That looks dead safe, don't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Are all the habs raised up on stilts? Doesn't look at all safe."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","Nice locale. Just where you want to put down roots."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","Fine old place, ain't it? Slippery floors, troubling echoes and a smell you can cut with a knife."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","Catch a lungful of that! 'Rank' doesn't begin to describe it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","Reminds me of the time I was digging latrines for the Tempestus Scions."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","Everything's shut up. And I could use a shopping spree!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","What a jolly little trading street... I don't think."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Could be me, but I'm not sure this should be a slope."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","Cheeky little floor they've got in this place, but I like mine level."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_alive_01","Smelter's waking up!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_alive_02","Yeah! The smelter's waking up!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","All this for a few Leman Russes. Doesn't seem worth it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","What's so special about this place anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Don't suppose I can get some of that hardened armour for myself?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Say no more. The longer the tanks last, the better. Means I'm not getting shot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","You talk a lot, Tech Priest, but never about yourself."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Fancy telling us something about yourself, Tech Priest? It'll pass the time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Look at us, becoming friends. We'll have you smiling next."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Careful ... You don't want to get to emotional. You'll sprain something."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Stupid karking heretics. I could shut this place down for good with enough meltabombs."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Heretics are doing this the hard way. They want this place shut, level it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Leman Russ reinforcements for the heretics?  No thank you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Yeah, that sounds like a world of pain for the rest of us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Where is this karking smelter anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Can we find this karking smelter? I want out of here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_hellhole_01","It's getting hot ... Let's get out of here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_hellhole_02","I'm karking melting. Can we leave now?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Can't imagine it's normally so quiet around here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_lifeless_02","Heretics aside, it's a karking ghost town down here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","There we go! Right in through the front door."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","We're going in through the front door? Subtle."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Lots of cheery posters. Gives me a nice warm glow, I don't think."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_propaganda_02","I couldn't work in a place like this. Give me a suicide mission any day."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Cornered? Yes! Easy pickings? No karking way!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","We'll have to hold out until the elevator's here!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","[Whooping Breath] Can't hardly breathe. Yeah, this'll be fun."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Air's tangy, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Rannick seems desperate to keep this place. Wonder what he's not telling us?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Must be a karking important manufactorum, this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_hack_01","Time to go data thieving. Sounds good to me!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_hack_02","Bit of data thieving, is it? Let's hit up something dead valuable next time, yes?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","Part shanty town. Part junkyard. All nasty."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","These heretics live like packrats, don't they?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Lots of nasty stuff hereabouts. Anything you maybe missed on the briefing?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Looks like sentient sewer in here. What's the karking deal?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Oh, I do so like surprises. Honest."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Isn't that lovely? No. No it's not."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","You want to tell me why there's a daemon here at all?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Karking daemons. What's it doing here?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","[Spit] Filthy karking heretics."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","As if I needed one more reason to hate the heretic scum."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Let's hope the karking daemon's satisfied with this building."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","This daemon… is it confined to Sector Periferus?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Fire. That's what we need. Lots and lots of fire."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Bah! I'll take it on. Just let me at the big guns."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Looks like that elevator's already at capacity."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","Something nasty in that lift shaft..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Won't find me getting won over by some heretic broadcast. Will of adamantium, that's me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Heretics are wasting their time trying to put their hoodoo on me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Getting dizzy. Bet we're a long way up."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I bet it's a long way down from where we are."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Schlep, schlep, schlep. Just once, I'd like to arrive in style."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","My legs are aching already. Why do we have to walk everywhere?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Breath that down. I'll start missing all those chems in the ventilation system."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","Get a lungful of that. Sure, it burns a little but it's free of tranqs. Unlike lower down."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","You know, it's almost pleasant out here. Don't suppose we can stay?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Now this is more like it! Much better than the grubby levels down below."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","We're karking trapped!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","Oh, so it's a trap. Got it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","Sneaky little heretics, sealing us in."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","Hang on ... What's happening?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Vox is dead. So are we."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Vox has gone dark."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Want to bet the Mourningstar set us up?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","I told you Grendyl wanted us dead!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Fine, but I ain't going down easy!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","They want me, I'm right here!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","I'm not dying easy, I can tell you that!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","Bring it on, heretic scum!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_02","Looks like a karking skyfire command relay. We'd better disable it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_district_gate_01","Karkers have sealed this district up. I wonder if anyone escaped?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_district_gate_02","No one's getting out that way ... If there's anyone left alive to escape."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Lot of trouble to get here. I hope it was worth it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Why's this karking place so important?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Count me out of the assault. We only got this far because they didn't see us coming."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Taking this place head-on is a karking death sentence."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You know plenty about this place, explicator. I thought you were a Torrent-rat?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Hey, explicator. How does a Torrent-rat know so much about this district?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Not so pure and fluffy as you seem, are you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","I karking knew it! Say ... can you get me one or two ... ? Nah, forget it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Special issue ammo? I've not seen hide nor hair of any back on the Mourningstar."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Do I get to keep some of this special issue ammo? I'm a connoisseur."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Now that's not fair. Not that you care, of course."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Karking typical. All of the work, none of the reward."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","That hab block looks familiar. Then again, they all do."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","Least we're not sealed up in that karking hab block."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","Going in the pretty way, I see?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","I guess we're not seeing the sights today?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_trains_01","Not sure I like having trains rattle past above my head ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_rails_trains_02","Let's hope the karking gantries don't collapse while the trains are passing ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Heretics everywhere. Just how I like it!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","Come on you karkers! Come out and play!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","You sure that karking bridge is moving?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","And that's where they all died, waiting for a bridge. Not very heroic."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","But I don't want to cross something called ""The Bridge of Many Martyrs""."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","Martyrdom isn't very ""me"". But what the hel ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","Oi! Do we look like engineers?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","If it's more complicated than pulling a lever, we might be in trouble."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","Looks like we've a fight on our hands!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","Just once I'd like the karkers to realise they ain't gonna win this one!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Bring 'em on says I! I was getting bored!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","I'll have yours if you don't want 'em!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","Preacher's pulpit. Bet he was the first to run when it got sticky."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","You can always trust a preacher to scarper when the fighting starts. No staying power."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","Let's give the heretics one for him. Or two. Or twelve!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","Ah, he'll be fine. That sort always are."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Well, well, well. Clean floors, cleanish air ... must be going up in the world."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Starting to get into the nicer parts are we? About karking time."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_retrieve_01","What does Morrow think I am? A karking pack grox?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_retrieve_02","Fetch. Carry. Fetch. Carry. Another riveting day in the service of Inquisitor Grendyl."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scan_01","So, this servo-skull we've been set up with ... you reckon it's worth anything?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scan_02","Once the mission's done, let's see if we can't flog this servo-skull to one of the mud thumpers back at HQ."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","Nice to be within spitting distance of fresh air again. As fresh as it gets on this Hel hole, anyway."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Look at that! A bit of honest-to-duty daylight! Bright, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Not exactly a place you'd want to settle down, is it? Or even hide out. How long's it been this way?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","This place doesn't exactly sell the idea of the Emperor's Glory, does it? Been like this long?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Better off leaving it well alone, if you ask me. No point trying to fix the mistakes of the past. I know all about that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Well, nothing worth saving here now. Job well done by Tertium's administratum, and no mistake."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Lovely. A great big Vault full of plagues, and we're heading right into it? Just my karking luck."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","You know, if we had any sense we'd be heading in the other direction - you know, away from the plague Vault?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Revolting little creeps. Someone ought to put them out of our misery. Oh, wait. We will."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Filthy little karkers. Death's too good for them."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I bet loads of merchant craft came through here … You know, before it went to rot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Bet these skies would have been a lot busier if you went back a couple of centuries."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","The past is the past. I'm more worried about surviving the present."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Leave the past where it is. The present's dangerous enough."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_interior_01","This karking place is ready to collapse! One more hive quake and it'll come down on us!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Yeah. Lovely. Come all this way, and the lot will probably collapse on us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","This isn't a servitor colony, it's a karking tomb. Some of the inhabitants aren't dead yet, that's all."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","What a karking mess! How is any of it still working?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Hello … Looks like the cargo elevator's where we need it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","Looks like our path's clear. Let's hope the cargo elevator's sturdier than it looks."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","Too many karking corridors if you ask me. It's ambush city!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","Let's keep moving. Too karking easy to get surrounded down here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_approach_01","And there we go - Chasm Terminus. Showy, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_approach_02","Station's in sight. Gotta tell you, I'm not thrilled to be marching up to the front door."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Whoever lands the final shot buys the drinks, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","Let's show this karker who they're dealing with!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","Just sit back and enjoy the screams!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just let me get to work."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What's waiting for us down there?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Can you tell us anything more about this karker?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Just as well I like a challenge, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","In the Guard or out of it, it's never easy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","Nice decor. Just the thing for when you're peeling brains apart."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","It's a magistratum catechizer post, isn't it? Places like this give me the shudders."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Maybe we should redirect a couple of supply trains while we're at it. You know, pinch some of the good stuff from the heretics?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Let's say we do kill our target. Can one man really be that important?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","You know, you're a real buzzkill sometimes, explicator."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Anyone ever tell you that you're a mite touchy, explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","I love ambushes. Never give a sucker an even break."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Don't know about anyone else, but I reckon this should be fun."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","And this way's more fun as well, so there's that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","If you say so. I just know I'm going to karking enjoy this."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","I still say this'd have been easier to do at Chasm Terminus."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","This is a karking joke. We should have gone straight to the station - done everything from there."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","If you say so. I say you're karking mad."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Well, if it works, it works. I try to be practical about these things."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","Piquet-line duty, is it? Rather them than me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","This lot have been here awhile. You can see it in their smiling faces."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_station_hall_01","Look at all this mess! I bet the station commandant's spinning in his shallow grave."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_station_hall_02","This place has seen better days, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Woo-hoo! Do you see that to the south? We're not the only ones having fun!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_station_the_bridge_02","Bit of a light-show off to the south. Care to place a bet on which side wins?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","I thought the Cartel would spring for nicer quarters..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Not exactly the romantic ideal of the criminal life, is it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","This place is so nasty... it's no wonder a daemon ended up down here."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Ain't right, having a daemon burrowing around and about..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Wish I'd brought a bigger gun..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I knew it! Should have stayed in bed."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Does Rannick have a plan for taking the Torrent back?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Seems we'd do better to take back the Torrent."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","You don't sound like you agree."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","You're not thinking he has the right of it, are you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I kinda like it down here. Reminds me of my youth."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Bet this place was a riot before the heretics took over."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I like it more already."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","You don't say? You're just making me curious now."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","A holo statue? Bit showy for down here, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","A holo statue? Expensive. Don't suppose we could, you know, salvage it."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","I like what they've done with the gateway. Or I would, if we didn't have to go around."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","Main entrance is karking sealed. We'll have to find another way."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","It's all rotting. What's in the air down here anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","See the state of those walls. That's acid damage."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Probably best not to ask what's in the water before it gets purified..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","You know, compared to a lot of the hive, this place looks in good nick."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","[Cough] Some use that atmospheric shield is. Every breath's a mouthful of karking grit."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","That atmospheric shield's more gap than metal ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_crossroads_01","Would it have killed them to install some signposts?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Well, this sure doesn't look like somewhere we could get lost ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Hang on ... We're inside the refinery - are we inside the daemon too?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","Hold up a moment ... are we in the daemon's stomach now?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","Dry as a bone. These aren't the chambers we're after."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","Karking empty. Keep looking!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Lucky for us, we're really good at persuading folk to let us into places."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","Nothing a bit of firepower can't fix, I'm sure."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","This elevator's a real bone-rattler, ain't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","You hear that? I think one of the cables is on its last legs."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","If we plunge to our deaths, it'll at least be quick."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","So you'd rather I didn't jump up and down, is that right?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","You'd need an army to do that. Don't suppose you've got one to spare?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","It'll be harder than you think. These karkers have made this place their own."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","All this talk about daemons. That's karking mad, isn't it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","So, let's see if I heard right before ... That was a daemon?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Never get a straight karking answer around here, do we?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Ask a silly question, get a worthless answer. It's like being back in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","You do know we'll all be exposed to this karking disease, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","I hope we're all feeling robust ... otherwise this pathogen will rip right through us."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","Fine comfort that'll be once the projectile dysentery kicks in."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Karking wonderful. Sounds like we're as good as dead."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","Lot of talk about this pathogen, and not a lot of karking detail ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","What sort of pathogen have we got here anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Is anyone else suddenly feeling a bit itchy?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh, that's the stuff of nightmares, right there!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","Ain't this cosy? Rust, ruin and all the dust you can eat."
"loc_veteran_male_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","You keep sending us to the nicest places. Spoilt, that's what we are."
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_01","It's attacking!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_02","Get clear!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_03","Watch out!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_04","Look out!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_05","Get out of there!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_06","Don't let it hit you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_07","Looks like you made it mad!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_08","You made it angry!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_09","It doesn’t like you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_combo_attack_10","Idiot! Get clear!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","At last! A challenge!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Come on, ugly! What've you got?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","We've got this, guys and gals!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","Time to go to work!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Are we ready? Karking right!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","Give it a good smacking!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","Let's show ugly how we do things!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","I've killed tougher!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","That's gonna be a problem…"
"loc_veteran_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","Let's take it apart!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__need_rescue_01","Someone get me free!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__need_rescue_02","Let me at these karkers!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__need_rescue_03","Oi! Cut me loose!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__need_rescue_04","You waiting for an invitation? Rescue me!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__need_rescue_05","Get me karking loose! I want payback!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","Ugh. If I never see another scrap of daemon-goop, it'll be too soon."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","So much goop. That daemon must be really big. Or there are plenty of 'em."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","Message received, loud and clear."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","I do enjoy our little chats."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","You know, seeing all this corruption gives me an itchy feeling."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","It's a real mess hereabouts, ain't it? Atoma's getting worse."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","Oh, now the claws come out. And I was just starting to like you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","Got it. Mouth shut, even when we're screaming. Same old, same old."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","Wouldn't catch me bending the knee to a god of pus and maggots."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","Praying to a god of disease? These heretics are mad!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","Stupid karkers. Death's too good for them."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","I reckon their brains are the first thing to rot."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","Surely we've killed enough heretics that they get the message: Nurgle can't save you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","Nurgle doesn't seem to offer much salvation while we're around ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Well, it's not exactly something you use in regular conversation."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","Have it your way. I'm not looking for trouble."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","Is it even worth saving the hive? I mean, look at the place!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","Such a karking mess! This hive's done for, I tell you."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","Ah, you make it sound so easy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","Looks a lot easier from up there, I bet."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_01","I reckon that's karking alive!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_02","What a horrible lump of flesh that is ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_03","Oi, ugly. Don't get comfortable - someone'll come back here with a flamer."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_04","Well, well, well ... Aren't you an ugly karker?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_05","Rannick ain't paying enough for me to look at ... that."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_06","Don't want to worry you, but that thing looks alive."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_07","Oh, isn't nature wonderful? Not that there's anything natural about that ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_08","Now that ... ? That doesn't belong. Not one little bit."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_09","Not a pretty sight. Not even by the standards on Atoma."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_10","Isn't life wonderful? Do you reckon we can kill it?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_01","Gonna take more than a broom to clean this place up."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_02","Reminds me of my first barracks, only it's cleaner."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_03","It's like an officer's conscience in here: suspect and sticky."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_04","Now, I know the walls look tasty, but don't you go licking them."
"loc_veteran_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_05","Physical blight? Check. Urge to vomit? Strong."

"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_daemon_eyes_b_01","Got that right. One sign of some daemon behind your eyes and I'll drop you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_daemon_eyes_d_01","Consider it a promise. A Cadian promise."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_dedication_b_01","Long as they get the job done, who cares?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_dedication_d_01","Maybe. But it's the only one I've got."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_fate_b_01","Couldn't tell you. All I know is my world's gone. Abandoned by the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_fate_d_01","It is the only one I've got."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_final_hours_b_01","It stood until it could stand no more. The world broke before the Guard did."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_final_hours_d_01","Not like the rest of the Imperium. It abandoned us."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_funny_look_b_01","Don’t know what you mean. But that funny look it your eyes is getting worse."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_funny_look_d_01","If you say so. I say it’s a funny look."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_vet_c_c_01","Don't. Makes you sloppy. Weak. Dead."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_ogr_b_b_01","You ain't as useless as you look."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_ogr_b_d_01","Am I ever?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_psy_c_b_01","I can teach you, if you want to learn."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_psy_c_d_01","Copy that. "
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_vet_b_b_01","Keep watching. You might learn to be a proper soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_vet_b_d_01","Pride's a curse. Remember that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_zea_a_b_01","That's the training. Cadian training."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_zea_a_d_01","You come over here and say that!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heart_b_01","That’s my business, not yours. It’s enough that I carry it with me in my heart."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heart_d_01","That’s your business, not mine."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_17_b_01","Don't matter if a soldier falls, long as he fights on."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_17_d_01","Misery and me are old friends."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_18_b_01","Didn't see it coming in time."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_18_d_01","They're dead. All of them. As soon as I get my breath back."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_19_b_01","I'm dead already in every way that counts."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_19_d_01","Don't worry. You'll get through it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_20_b_01","Noted. Weren't exactly by choice."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_20_d_01","Thanks. Now, how about we get some payback?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_21_a_01","Spend more time watching and less time talking, and that won't happen."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_21_c_01","Can't say them if you're dead."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_22_a_01","You take a hit well, I'll give you that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_22_c_01","Yeah ... Not sure that's much of a secret."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_23_a_01","That looks painful."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_23_c_01","I don't. But you're not me, are you?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_24_a_01","Breathe. Good and steady. The pain will pass."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_heavy_injury_24_c_01","The pain will pass."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_hope_falls_b_01","Do not elevate your hopes. Everyone falls, sooner or later. Everything falls."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_hope_falls_d_01","Yeah. Count your victories in blood and your losses in memory."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_in_control_a_01","You're different to the rest. Disciplined. Focused. In control."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_in_control_c_01","Won’t last, of course. All Witches lose control. Sooner or later."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_killing_a_01","You might actually be good at this, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_killing_c_01","You're not supposed to enjoy it! It's duty."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_killing_e_01","... I didn't say that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_leman_russ_b_01","Truth. Fancy weapons can't hold a candle to it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_leman_russ_d_01","Damn straight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_mercy_kill_a_01","When my time comes. No tears. No suffering. One to the head and let it be done."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_mercy_kill_c_01","You do this for me, you’ll prove me wrong."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_alert_a_01","You wait ... any minute now and this is all going straight to hel."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_alert_c_01","Oh, it'll happen. Always does, sooner or later. That's why you've gotta stay alert. You hear me?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_ambush_b_01","Yeah, I'd be more surprised if we weren't."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_ambush_d_01","Copy that. Do let me know if that changes, won't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dark_clouds_b_01","I'd keep that to yourself if I were you. Your word against hers? You'll be dead before you can blink."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dark_clouds_d_01","Like we'll ever run short of danger ... but I'll keep an eye open."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dreams_b_01","I don't have dreams. They were beaten out of me."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dreams_d_01","It's not so bad. Keeps you focused."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dreams_f_01","I don't break. Never have. Never will."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_a_01","Still alive? Had a moment back there when I thought you were done for."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_c_01","You want to watch over yourself. The Emperor can be fickle."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_e_01","Copy that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_flank_a_01","You hanging in there, Big Man? "
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_flank_c_01","Just watch the flank, yeah? Don't want any surprises."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_like_a_01","Didn't see many Ogryns before I ended up here, but I'm getting used to having you around, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_like_c_01","Didn't say I liked you. I don't like anyone. That's weakness, and I don't do ""weak""."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lose_a_01","Them heretics are making us work for it today, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lose_c_01","Damn right they won't. We don't know how to lose, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_never_over_a_01","Don't let your guard drop. They're still out there."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_never_over_c_01","It'll never be over. Not while one heretic draws breath."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_nobles_a_01","Heard some chatter on the Mourningstar. Political infighting among the nobles, or something like that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_nobles_c_01","No chance. Nobles are only good for two things: catching bullets and causing trouble. Let's hope this lot end up in the first category."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_paranoid_d_01","I didn't hear nothing. Definitely didn't hear her call you paranoid."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_peace_b_01","There is no peace. There is only war."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_peace_d_01","If you say so. Just don't talk like that around Zola. Won't end well."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_peerless_a_01","You're the first Ogryn I've known capable of taking orders, you know that?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_peerless_c_01","Hang on, hang on ... Who's been telling you that?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_promotion_b_01","A what? Ain't got no ranks down here ... unless you count ""corpse"" and ""heretic""."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_promotion_d_01","Better get used to the idea. You'll be one or the other sooner or later."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smile_b_01","No. "
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smile_d_01","Well, you're a freak, ain't you? Imagine things all the time."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smile_f_01","Leave it, all right? Before things get nasty."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soft_b_01","No."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soft_d_01","Yes."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soldier_a_01","You keep your discipline in a firefight. Discipline's good."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soldier_c_01","You've still got a long way to go before you're a soldier, but you'll get there."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_special_orders_b_01","Stay alive. Fight hard. Kill heretics."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_special_orders_d_01","Do it all over again."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_squishy_b_01","Pretty sure they always made 'em this way. Lots of bad choices holding a gun."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_squishy_d_01","You're just getting better at killing 'em, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_mourn_b_01","It ain't Cadia I'm worried about. It's you lot. Too soft. Too weak."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_mourn_d_01","So you say. Believe it when I see it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_never_trust_a_01","Used to have a Witch attached to my old platoon. Never trusted her, neither."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_never_trust_c_01","Brothers and sisters of Cadia? Yes. Soldiers of the Militarum? Maybe. The rest? That’s just asking for disappointment."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_obsession_b_01","And how would they do that, exactly?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_obsession_d_01","I wouldn’t know about that. I’m a soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_relaxation_b_01","I do not relax. That's when they get you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_relaxation_d_01","Heretics. Traitors. Mutants ... Psykers. Better to be wound tight than to be a corpse."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_discipline_a_01","You need more discipline. Sort it out, or I'll sort you out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_discipline_c_01","Oh, that wasn't a threat. It was a promise."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_serious_b_01","If you lighten up, you get sloppy. You get sloppy, you get killed."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_serious_d_01","Maybe, but at least I'll see it coming."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_stealth_b_01","Yeah, I'd noticed. You're hard to miss."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_suicide_mission_b_01","That's handy. You're already on one."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_talking_a_01","Never did much care for Priests. Talk too much, don’t fight enough."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_talking_c_01","I don’t kill to make an offering. I kill for survival. Mine or others."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_trust_weapons_a_01","You rely too much on your freakish powers. Trust your weapons. Trust your squad."
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_trust_weapons_c_01","Yeah? But you have lower standards, don’t you?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_vainglory_a_01","Think a lot of yourself, don’t you?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__bonding_conversation_vainglory_c_01","Sounds like a wordy way of saying “yes” to me."

"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_gas_b_01","Just keep shooting. The rest will attend to itself."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_gas_b_02","Keep moving towards the enemy. Best way."

"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_a_02","Low visibility means lots of ambushes. Stand ready!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_b_01","Copy that. Adopting close quarter protocols."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_b_02","Just like the training grounds at Kasr Kren."

"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_14_b_01","Understood."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_01_b_01","Serve and be rewarded..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_05_b_01","No."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_09_b_01","Don't think, just kill."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_13_b_01","You're not alone, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_17_b_01","True."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_01_b_01","We're done when the war's done, witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_04_b_01","You'll have the chance to run again one day..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_b_01","Means nothing. War is suffering. You fight until it's won."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_b_01","I've heard more foolish things, but not many."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_16_b_01","You want quiet? Then shut up."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_17_b_01","Don't care. Keep moving."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_01_b_01","Irrelevant."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_04_b_01","As long as needed."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_b_01","Keep your babbling in your skull."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_12_b_01","It's no dream."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_16_b_01","Most of war's waiting. Get used to it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_17_b_01","No. I know you're an abomination."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_b_01","Were here to engage and destroy the enemy. Your gratification's nothing to do with it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_08_b_01","For once, yes."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_b_01","We're here to kill the enemy. Anything else is irrelevant."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_16_b_01","Clean kills, enemies suffering; nothing else should give satisfaction."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_20_b_01","Vengeance is more important than law or justice."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_06_b_01","Understood."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_b_01","Acknowledged. Let's move!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_b_01","Same as life everywhere - a battlefield."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_13_b_01","Copy!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_14_b_01","Negative. Cadia taught me everything I need."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","You're not from Cadia. You've not seen the other kind."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_03_b_01","Maybe. Your point?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_06_b_01","Worse is coming, for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_b_01","No."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_b_01","Rest when you're dead."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_13_b_01","While you're a poor excuse for a soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_14_b_01","Agree on both counts."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_01_a_01","Survival's not likely, but mission success is still possible."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_a_01","I don't trust any of you. Clear?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_03_a_01","Time to count the ammo and offer our prayers."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_04_a_01","Cadia fell and places like this endure. Where's the justice in that?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_04_b_01","No justice, only vengeance."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_a_01","Though I walk with the weak, I remain strong."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_07_a_01","Hear that? That quiet is the sound of fate breathing in before vomiting all over us."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_08_a_01","Want to hear a truth? We're dead already. Just a question of when it catches up with us."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_08_b_01","Grave's dug, but I'm not going to lie in it yet."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_a_01","If the fight goes bad, take as many of them with you as you can."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_10_a_01","Weakness. That's why places like this fall."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_11_a_01","This place is gone. Kill the rot then burn the ruins."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_12_a_01","If we hit trouble, bullets will see us through before prayers."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_12_b_01","Every kill-shot's a prayer to the Emperor."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_a_01","Think about killing first and surviving second, and you might make it through."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_14_a_01","More shots on target next time. Sharpen up. All of you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_15_a_01","It's quiet... big attack's coming soon."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_16_a_01","Do better next time. I'll not have us shame the dead of Cadia."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_16_b_01","For Cadia..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_17_a_01","I've seen better than us go into zones like this and not come out. Stay sharp."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_18_a_01","We're damned. That's why we're still alive. The good and pure are already in their graves."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_19_a_01","Take my advice: Give up hope. Hold onto vengeance. That's all."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_20_a_01","Mission is still on! Tighten up!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_20_b_01","Copy that!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_01_b_01","Affirmative. Their taint's everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_03_b_01","True as true."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_04_b_01","Vengeance is its own reward."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_07_b_01","No need to understand them. Just end them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_16_b_01","Vengeance is the Emperor's truth."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_17_b_01","That's the truth."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_01_b_01","Leave only ashes."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_03_b_01","And they shall burn. All of them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_04_b_01","Negative. Think, then execute. Anything else is a shortcut to failure."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_07_b_01","The Emperor's not been this way for a long while, priest."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_16_b_01","No, Priest. We get ourselves out of this."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_17_b_01","And we are that harvest."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_b_01","Down to you, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_05_b_01","Seeing the enemy dead is enough for me."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_09_b_01","Then why mention it?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_13_b_01","If you say so."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_17_b_01","Never has. Never will."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Quiet, ain't it? Yeah, it worries me as well."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_02","We have a job to do. Let's get out there and karking do it!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_03","All this standing around makes me nervous. Let's move out!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Nothing like a killing spree to shake the cobwebs."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_05","Emperor's Throne... I have missed being in the field."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Think we scared them off? Shame."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_07","You see anything that isn't one of us lot, you put it down."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_08","We may not be the Imperium's finest, but we're still amazing."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_09","Death waits. And glory, perhaps, but mostly death."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Let's hope the Emperor really is watching us."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","It's just a word. Don't worry about it, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","It's short for 'absolutely human'. I promise."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","You telling me how to fight? What a laugh."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","Keep your gun up and your advice to yourself."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","If you didn't shoot at every shadow..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","You waste ammo, you lose ammo. Simple maths."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Limited ammo doesn't mean limited to you!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","We're all trying to survive here. Share the ammo!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Share the ammo. Won't warn you again."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","You want ammo? Find your own."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","I'm doing more good with this ammo than you are!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Situation normal, then?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","I'll consider myself duly warned."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","How about you keep it to yourself, Witch?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","Sensing trouble, says you? Let's kill it, says I."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Die dumb, die smart... it's all the same in the end."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","Ignorance is bliss, Big Man. Hold onto it while you have it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","They'll come, Big Man. Just you wait and see."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Enjoy the breather. It won't last long."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","You're not fooling anybody here."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","Even a tiny bullet can find its mark. Pay attention!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Whatever gets you through the fight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Optimism? Huh."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","Yeah, but your fists are big enough to choose."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","Give me a bullet over a punch any day."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","You can warm up when you reach the fires of Hel, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","The cold's the least of your worries, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","Be competent a little further away from me, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Few more months and you might be vaguely useful."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Enforcers do what they must."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","They are not known for their tolerance."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_a_01","We're all dead already. Make it count."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_a_02","Death's just round the corner. Let's ambush it!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_a_03","May as well die fighting. It's inevitable anyway."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","We live to die."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","I live as a Guard, I will die as a Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Perhaps they're just trying to get a word in edgeways?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","You could learn a trick or two about being quiet yourself."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","Ah yes, the mighty Nork Deddog. A great tale."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Nork Deddog. None finer."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","I've got your back this time, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","Look to your own defence. I'll look to mine."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","Hold the line, or you'll answer to me!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","Desertion ain't a joke, Soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Shows how much you understand the real world."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","As always, it's down to the cogs to do the machine's work."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","How about you practice what you preach, Soldier?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","Any unit is only as good as its leader. Which means we're karked."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","You'd still run screaming if one landed at your feet."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Ain't no more reliable way to clear a path."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_a_01","The galaxy's sliding into hel. It'll take discipline and cold steel to change that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_a_02","Focus. Steel. Discipline. Hel take us all otherwise."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_a_03","We're all that's between this place and Hel."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","In the Guard we trust."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","You think it's bad now? Come back later."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","I hear a good slap wakes you from a dream. Need a hand with that?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","How about trying reality on for size, Witch?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","There's a time and place for liquor and this ain't it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","Drink numbs the senses. I'm out of both."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","The Emperor Protects. Except when he doesn't."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","I hope he's brought a rifle."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","I've seen the fall of a world. This one's not done yet."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","While we still stand, so does Atoma. Get to it, Soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","Kill more, talk less. We all win."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","The pestilence has taken deep root for sure. Let's get to purging."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","War is just the respite before death."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","I'm a Guardsman. I've always known this."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","I'm from Cadia. I've been expendable since my first breath."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","In other news, water proven to be wet."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Chin up, Big Man. At least your feet are still attached."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Your feet don't stop you firing a gun, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","Can't deny it's effective. And impressive."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","That's all well and good until you're in a confined space."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Destroy the enemy. Rinse, repeat. You've got this, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Just shoot anything that ain't us. That'll do."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","Thanks for the encouraging words."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","To think I gave up a prison cell for this karking fancy-talk."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Don't get too attached."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You're passable, I suppose."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","You know you're basically disgusting, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Sounds... delicious."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","You don't like Poxwalkers? They say such good things about you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","How about we make them all the way dead?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Don't worry about sharing the medicae. Oh, you're not. My mistake."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Save that medicae. We're gonna need it later."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","If your arm's not hanging off, don't waste healing on it!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","I'm more use to you alive than dead."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","I'm injured. I needed healing. What's the issue?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","At least you have a home."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","I feel that, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","You know that you can offer your fealty silently, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","I enjoy a good song. In the right circumstances."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Keep up the noise. They'll soon come back."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","Are you that desperate to die? Calm down, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","They'll come soon enough, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Your eagerness to die is duly noted."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","I think you shouldn't."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Can't be worse than the alternative."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","Really? You want to talk about culture? Now?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Celebrate the culture when we're done with the fighting."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","I'm sorry, did I give the impression I care?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Oh, you're real alright. Real annoying."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","Damn straight, Priest!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","I'm working on it!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","I don't actually care, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Throne, how do you ever get anything done?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","Kindness is just another form of weakness, Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","You've mistaken me for someone who cares."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","Take the sorrow and channel it into vengeance."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","True and true."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","If you find one, you crack right on, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Somehow, that idea fills me with dread."

"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Is now really the time, Priest?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Because everyone's gotta be best at something."

"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","We rarely get what we want, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","That's actually not as stupid as it sounds."

"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Even in the darkest of moments, the Emperor's Light shines. Atoma will stand."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","For Atoma! For the Guard!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","At least I actually know how to use my weapon, comrade."

"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","I hate admitting ignorance, but what is the Cicatrix Maledictum when it's at home?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","Oh. Oh, yeah, that clears it up completely. Thanks."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","Are we making any real headway here, Sarge? I mean, any at all?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","An intact hive city? Never thought I'd see the day."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","So I heard there's a second city. A sister settlement. What's that about?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","Die, you filth!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","Target is tough. Need heavier weapons."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Get behind it! Shoot it in the back!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","It's weak to the rear! Let's use that!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","Copy that!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Understood!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","Can't make my mind up about Zola. Whaddya reckon?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Explicator Zola... what do you think?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","Too closed off. Hard to trust someone like that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","I believe there's true loyalty there."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","Best keep her at arm's length."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","Every bit as tough as she looks, I bet."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Atoma is the explicator's homeworld, so I've heard."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","Heard that Atoma's the place our explicator calls home."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Caring what happens to her homeworld? I can respect that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Makes you wonder why she didn't stay."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","It doesn't surprise me, she seems the type."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Pretty sure I heard her muttering prayers during a landing. I know I was."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","That sounds... entirely legit."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","By the Throne, are you an actual idiot?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","I'm liking the pilot's energy. What do you make of her?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I find the pilot interesting. What about you?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","She's alright. We're not dead yet, so that's a bonus."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","She's like every other drop-jockey I ever met."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","She's the only pilot we've got right now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Well, I like her."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","You're going to tell me anyway, so get on with it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","I am all ears."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","She did? [Laugh] Good girl."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Can't imagine Brunt took that well."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","What's on your mind, Soldier?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","Something's bothering you, ain't it Soldier?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_02_01","Took a chance on our pilot and a handful of Darktown Whist. Didn't end well."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_02_02","That pilot is a cheat and a liar. Knew I shouldn't have trusted her."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_02_03","Cards plus our pilot equals karking cheating."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_02_04","Pilot suggested cards. Then cheated her way to winning."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","You win some, you lose some. Mostly, you lose."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Do you never learn?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_04_01","Nobody cheats me like that. Not twice, anyway!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_04_02","All I'm saying is... don't play cards with her."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_04_03","Can't help but admire her cheek just a little, though."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_04_04","Wonder what else she's hiding up those sleeves."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Target's tough. Need a new approach."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","It's not dying. Hit it harder!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Target the head!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","New target! Hit it in the ugly face!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Copy that. Engaging!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Understood! Complying!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","The dead never leave us. I get that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","Blames himself for their loss, no doubt."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","Morrow won't let it overcome him, don't worry."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","Better that he worry about the living right now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","Something's rattled the Sarge good and proper."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","Morrow's on the war-path. Keep your head down."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Probably with reason. Best advice is to steer clear."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","Morrow won't be angry without reason."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Leave him be. You don't want to cross someone who fought with Yarrick and that's the truth."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Old soldier, old wars, old wounds."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_01_01","Morrow's a veteran from Xanatros. That's gotta make him tougher than you might think."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_01_02","Did you know that Morrow was slap-bang in the Xanatros Purgation?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_01_03","Listen, Morrow is  Xanatros veteran. You understand what I'm saying?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_01_04","So I found something out about Morrow. He was a part of the Xanatros Purgation."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Xanatros? Karking... that explains a lot."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","Xanatros? You're kidding, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_03_01","Genestealers wiped out damn near three regiments and Space Marines to boot. And Morrow walked out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_03_02","Wall to wall genestealers. But Morrow survived it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_03_03","Let's say that genestealers were involved. A lot of genestealers. [Whistle] And Morrow survived."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_03_04","Out-lived three Mordian regiments and a host of genestealers. That's some story."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","Was Morrow working with the Inquisitor at that time as well?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","So was Morrow working for the Inquisitor there?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_01","Can't help but wonder how he walked out when so many didn't. Don't you?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_02","I wonder..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_03","If he walked out, I wonder who walked out with him?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_05_04","Tough old devil."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","I hear Morrow fought at Armageddon. He's too young, surely?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow's older than he looks. Heard he was at Hades Hive."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Hear tell his transport met a Warp storm. Time is only optional in those things."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Warp storms are involved. Anything's possible."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","No point in caring. He's in charge and that's how it is."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Does it really matter?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","Tech-Priests are all a little weird, but our Tech-Priest more so."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","I can't make head nor tail of our Tech-Priest. Sets me on edge."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","If looks could kill... I'd be on a karking slab."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","I'm pretty sure she wants to upgrade me."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","Keep your eyes open around her, that'll be smart."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","All the time she's someone else's problem, I'm good."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","Well, I'm motivated."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Is that right? Well, yay for us!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","The Emperor deserted Cadia. You'll forgive my doubts."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","We can but only hope that's true."
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Wouldst thou care for my fist in thy face?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Yeah, I understood none of that."

"loc_veteran_male_c__look_at_healthstation_08","Med station! Now!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__look_at_healthstation_09","Heal up! Now!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__look_at_healthstation_10","Get healed!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","Maybe. Doesn't matter much."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_four_c_02","Only type that matters is Soldier or not."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_a_01","Ratlings? Good snipers."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_a_02","Best snipers in the Guard? Ratlings. No question."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_a_03","A Ratling sniper can wipe out an enemy command before breakfast."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_a_04","Ratlings? The best murderers with sniper weapons I've seen."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_b_01","They're good. No doubt."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_b_02","Difficult to command, but lethal for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_c_01","Downside is they need triple rations."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_one_c_02","Eat as much as they kill."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_three_b_01","Abhumans're better than most humans."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","Soldier's a soldier. The rest doesn't matter."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","I prefer them to most of you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_two_b_01","They've got as much of a soul as you. More maybe."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_two_b_02","Never doubted that they've got souls. Not going to start now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_two_c_01","Humans have weaker souls."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","Trust them more than I trust most humans. Clear?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","Tanks break. Soldiers break then keep going."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","Tank support would be useful, but we're not getting it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","They make battle-tanks here, but you need trained crew."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","A tank is only as good as its crew."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_01","I'd give a lot for a Guard regiment right now. Even more for a platoon of Cadians."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_02","I'm Cadian. The Guard is everything. I miss it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_03","Strength, honour, steel and fire, that's the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_a_04","Situation like this I would give a lot for the guns of the Astra Militarum."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","The Guard is everything."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","There's nothing like being part of the Emperor's Hammer."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","Guard once, guard always."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","A hammer that can break any enemy."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Commissars don't find cowards among Cadians."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","Commissars in the Cadians either harden up or break."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Simple way to not get shot by a Commissar - don't be a coward."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","There can be no leniency for weakness."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","Prayers are strength. Except for when they're a crutch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","Preachers keep the faith, but Soldiers keep their own truth."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","No one more faithful than a soldier. War makes sure of that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Prayers keep you true, but soldiers win wars."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_four_b_01","What does it matter? It's all labels."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_four_b_02","A pirate? Well, I'd never have guessed."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_four_c_01","Fighting and plundering? Not so different from what we're doing now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_four_c_02","Truth is, I prefer my feet on solid ground."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_a_01","There's more to the Inquisitor and Brahms than meets the eye, I reckon."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_a_02","The shipmistress and Brahms. There's a story there, don't you think?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_a_03","Brahms and Grendyl. What do you reckon that relationship is all about?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_a_04","The shipmistress doesn't seem over-happy about any of this."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_b_01","She's focused on her task. That's commendable."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_b_02","Reckon Grendyl must have some hold over her."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_c_01","When we're here, she's the boss. Respect that and you'll be fine."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_one_c_02","Think I'll just keep her at arm's length."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_three_b_01","I've had better ferry captains. And worse."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_three_b_02","Probably sick of having to deal with the likes of us."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_three_c_01","Leave her to get on with it, that's what I say."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_three_c_02","She's got her job, we have ours. None of our business."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_two_b_01","Don't bite the hand that feeds you, Priest."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Wouldn't repeat that in earshot."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_two_c_01","If the xenos had the last medicae, you'd fork over the credits sharpish."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Strange times, odd bedfellows. But still. Xenos."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_four_b_01","Disease is their god. They want everything to rot."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_four_b_02","Their plagues keep them alive while it rots them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_four_c_01","Shoot them, burn them, and still you can't be sure they're done."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_four_c_02","No pain. No fear. Just at the price of damnation."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_one_a_01","Dark Gods, that's what these Heretics worship. But they're not gods."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_one_b_01","Only the Emperor is a God. All others are false."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_one_b_02","Daemons are lies, not gods."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Weakness that's how it starts. All it takes is one moment, one person, and the Warp gets in."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_one_c_02","If people were not weak the daemons would have no way in. Me, I don't blame Chaos, I blame those that fall to it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_three_b_01","Call it a realm if you like, but it's real."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_three_b_02","Such things shouldn't be said out loud."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_three_c_01","There's another place out there, for sure, but the best thing you can do is not think about it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Hel is real. I've seen it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Heretic Astartes are real. Pray you never see one."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_two_b_02","Daemons are terrible, but the Heretic Astartes are worse."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_two_c_01","You see one, you better have a company with you, because otherwise you are dead."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_chaos_two_c_02","Luck and overwhelming firepower, that's the only way to kill a Heretic Astartes."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_four_b_01","Home to daemons and the traitor legions. No worse place in the Galaxy."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_four_b_02","I was born looking into the Eye, trust me, you don't want to know what's in there."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_four_c_01","Cadia held the Eye shut for Millennia. Now it's gone, and Chaos is everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Cadia burned trying to hold the Eye of Terror shut... We will have vengeance for that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_a_01","Daemons exist in the Warp. Outside of it they are weak."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_a_02","The Warp is where Daemons exist. As long as they stay there we are safe."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_a_03","Realspace weakens Daemons.  Still dangerous though."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_a_04","Daemons can't cross into realspace. Not easily, at least."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Daemons are dangerous no matter where you are."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_b_02","Daemons might be weak in Realspace, but they'll still kill you and eat your soul."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_c_01","When it comes to Daemons I discount nothing."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Believe what you like. Just keep your weapons close and eyes open."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_three_b_01","You are as much a liability as an asset."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_three_b_02","You show the signs of possession, I'll kill you and not shed a tear."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_three_c_01","All witches are harbingers of ruin."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_three_c_02","This is not something we should be talking about.."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_two_b_01","Nowhere is safe now, not even Terra."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Everywhere is the front line now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_two_c_01","The defences held. At great cost. But they held."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_daemons_two_c_02","The daemons were defeated on Terra. That's all we need to remember."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","The only true god."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","Faith is strength. Questions just make you weaker."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","Keep you faith simple and strong. That's the Cadian way."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_01","Sisters of Battle would come in here and there'd be only ash left."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_02","Call in the Sisters of Battle and this place would cease to be a problem."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_03","Best force to deal with this mess? Sisters of Battle."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_a_04","Drop a Commandery of Sisters of Battle in and this fight would be done."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","They'll not send the Adepta Sororitas in."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","If they were going to send in the Sororitas they'd have done it already."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","Fire and fury... pray for it but don't hope for it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","We're here. Reckon they will think that's enough."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Every corner of the Galaxy should see the Emperor's Light."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","They do good work."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","No easy thing, pulling people up into the light."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","If half of humanity were as tough as Missionaries, we would have won already."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","Service should be its own reward."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","No one's going to hear about what we do."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","Remembered or forgotten, we've got a war to fight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","The Ecclesiarchy isn't going to hear anything about this."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","Mutants can be useful or dangerous. The difference is the difficult part."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","Tentacles, too many eyes, claws and jaws - that's what I worry about."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","There are mutants everywhere. What really matters is if they're corrupt or not."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","Psykers, they are the mutants I worry about."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","The Inquisition is as cruel as our enemies make it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","The Inquisition is what it needs to be. End of story."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Guilt is the only reason to be afraid of the Inquisition."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","This is a war of survival, not kindness."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","True. Never trust the witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","You can't trust any witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","Sanctioning makes no difference. All psykers can go bad."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","Psyker goes bad, shoot them before they turn you inside out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","A war to try and save the Imperium before it dies."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","War to try and get back what we just lost."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Lot of troops, lot of ships, but the enemy have more."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","You don't just need fleets, and armies you need the will to stand no matter what."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_01","For millennia Cadia held the gate to the Eye of Terror. Do you know how much blood that cost?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_02","Cadia fell, burned to ash, but we live! Hear that? Cadia lives!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_03","Cadia burned defending all of you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_a_04","Cadia fell. A whole world... my world, now a grave."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Cadia lives and Cadia stands!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","Every world is Cadia now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","We Cadians were born to fight and die for the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","Cadia did its duty, and still does."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","A plague of witches... another enemy to fight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","The witches were always beside us. The Awakening just pulled their masks off."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","Psyker are the real threat to the Imperium. Mark my words."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","More witches means one thing - Chaos."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","Hel. That's what's on the other side of the Great Rift."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","Darkness, terror, slaughter, that's what's past the Rift."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","There's always hope. But that hope comes at a cost in lives and blood."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","War, that's the only way the Dark Imperium comes back to the light. Endless war."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Ah, more flesh for the fodder cannon."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","The more of us there are, the better our chances."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","The more the merrier, I guess."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","Many hands make light work or... something."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_a_01","Reckon Grendyl keeps secrets from himself ... herself?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_a_02","So Grendyl's hiding behind a hologram... how karking mysterious."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_a_03","You ever wonder exactly who Grendyl really is?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_a_04","Wonder what Grendyl's hiding with all that mystery?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","You can bet that there are reasons for the secrecy."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","The endless playing of the mystery card is getting old."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","Inquisitor is top of the pile. We're the dregs."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","Mysterious Inquisitor. Secrets. Nothing can go wrong."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","An Inquisitor soiling their boots when there's grunts to do it for them?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","Atoma probably isn't the only concern for Grendyl right now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","That's what Rannick and Zola are for."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","It's none of our concern."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","As long as Grendyl has a plan."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Could you be any more sycophantic?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Until proven otherwise, Grendyl's in charge."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","Faithful, not faithful. Grendyl leads, we follow."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_four_b_01","Get away, you don't understand a word of what she says."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Can't say I've paid much attention."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_four_c_01","You carry on being you, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_four_c_02","Maybe you can tell me what she's on about, then."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_a_01","Hadron sets the hairs on my neck to standing up."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_a_02","Never felt comfortable around Tech-Priests. Especially ours."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_a_03","I'll admit. The Tech-Priest is creepy, but she knows her stuff."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_a_04","Tech-Priests are unsettling. Hadron doubly so."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_b_01","If you aren't mostly machine parts, she doesn't notice you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_b_02","She's alright. Does what she does and does it well, no doubt."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_c_01","If I start speaking in ones and zeroes, put me down, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_one_c_02","She's probably the least of what we have to worry about."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I wouldn't go into that mind if I were you, Witch. Won't end well."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Just like a Witch to poke where they're not wanted."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_three_c_01","Witches. Can't trust any of them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Ever thought of not being an interfering busybody?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Go on. Ask her for her age. I dare you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Probably down to good anti-rust treatments."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_two_c_01","Old age is a luxury few of us enjoy in the Guard."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hadron_two_c_02","She'll doubtless outlive us all."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","I'd question the staff turnover in that job, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","We not good enough for you any more?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","If you want my opinion, stay where you are."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Don't reckon she needs bodyguarding at all, truth be told."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_a_01","I like Hallowette. Tough. Unyielding. Solid, you know?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_a_02","Glad the Commodore's on our side. She's... tough."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_a_03","The Commodore has a mind like a steel trap. And is just as lethal, I bet."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_a_04","Hallowette is tough and I respect that fully. My advice - don't cross her."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The purser? Something happen?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Seems everyone round here has a story. Spill the beans."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","She's got Brunt well and truly under her thumb."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","Heard her yelling at Rannick. I was pretending not to enjoy it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Of course they're high. She's got a captive audience."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Have you tried not complaining and haggling instead?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","It's definitely a seller's market."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","We're just profit on legs to her eyes."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Don't really have an opinion."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Why do you care what I think anyway?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","She can clear a room with a single glare."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She'd slit your throat as soon as look at you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Nobles, officials, and high born."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","The people in charge."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","In war, I'd take the lowborn every time."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","Living at the top makes you weak."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_01","Hives breed gangs like dung hatches flies..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_02","Hives grow, and gangs breed in the sump at the bottom."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_03","A hive isn't a hive without gangs."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_a_04","Hive gangs. Dregs of the Imperium."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Best thing to do with gangs is to scoop them up and send them to a war zone."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Gangs are scum... but they can make effective soldiers."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Give them a lasgun and get them on the front lines."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","They're ruthless, merciless killers... fine material for the Astra Militarum."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Darkness, violence, and suffering - all of the Imperium is here."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Life on a war world makes this look soft."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Hives can kill you faster than a enemy strike force."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Every way to die - a Hive has them all."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","It's what the manufactorums make that matters - weapons and armour."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Industry only has one use - to supply armies."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","These factories won't be supplying armies for a generation at least."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","Once we win, it's going to take a lot to get this lot working."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Only thing a hero earns is their grave."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_four_c_02","No bell will toll for us."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_a_01","Holy Terra, the centre of all.  Ever wonder what's it like?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_a_02","Terra... Sometimes you've gotta wonder if it's even real, right?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_a_03","Any of you seen Terra?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_a_04","My one wish? To see Terra."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Terra's just a dream. Here and now, that's what's real."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_b_02","Terra is going to be like everywhere else - at war."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_c_01","We fight for Terra, nothing else matters."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Never going to see it this side of the grave."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_three_b_01","No tithe. No soldiers to protect any world."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_three_b_02","Flesh and blood, every world must give it or fall to enemies."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_three_c_01","The tithe is the price of survival."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_three_c_02","No tithe. No Imperium. No humanity. Simple."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_two_b_01","And every world's at war."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Every year more worlds burn. Lose enough battles and they'll soon be none."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_two_c_01","This rock we stand on right now's the only one that matters."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Cadia fell.  No one thought it could. What chance have the rest got?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","Never seen an Assassin. Never want to."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","Officio Assassinorum don't turn up for trouble like this."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","An assassin means that we're in far above our tithe grade."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","If they could've sent an assassin we'd not be here."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_01","Exterminatus - that's what's going to happen here. Count on it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_02","Exterminatus... They are going to burn this place down to the bedrock."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_03","Exterminatus, that's what's coming."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_a_04","If it was me I'd have called in an Exterminatus already."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","Crack open the planet's skin like an egg shell. Whole place becomes ash."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Cyclonic torpedo from low orbit. Job done."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Could be they've given the order already. We'd never know."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","This place can burn now or later, makes no difference."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","Inquisitors are above the law. Us... were just breaking it by order."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Law can protect traitors. Someone needs to judge them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","There is no law in places like this anyway."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","War has no laws."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","It gives... purpose, and that's enough."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Killing traitors? No higher honour."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","The Ordo doesn't matter. Just the mission."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","If the enemy burns, I don't care who tells me to set the blaze."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","It's a mystery."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","It works. That's all we know."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Do you think any of us really have the first clue about any of it?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","I am a soldier. Holy mysteries are for others."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_a_01","Solar Macharius... need a soldier like that now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_a_03","Macharius... pushed back the darkness and died on campaign. That's a soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_a_04","More leaders like Solar Macharius and we wouldn't be in this mess."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","Soldier and saint. A true hero."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","And now he watches over true soldiers as a saint."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","Killed by a traitor. That tells us something."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","How he died doesn't matter, only how he fought."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Ignorance is a blessing."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","Better ignorant than weakened by knowledge."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","The past is dead. The fight here and now is all that matters."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","If the past can help us fight now, then good. Otherwise it's dead and gone."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","One man almost killed the Imperium. Dark times."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","Blood and madness, that's what I heard it was."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Justice came for Vandire in the end. Like it does for all traitors."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Vandire was cut down in his lair. A just end."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_four_b_01","Aren't we all loyal servants?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_four_b_02","Loyalty goes a long way in a set-up like this."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_four_c_01","Someone that straight-laced is up to something."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_four_c_02","Bureaucrats. You know one, you know them all."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_a_01","Melk's a bureaucrat's bureaucrat, ain't he?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_a_02","That karking obnoxious Melk is heading for a black eye."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_a_03","Melk ain't even trying my patience, he's used it all up."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_a_04","If you look up 'sycophant', you'll find Melk."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_b_01","Oh. His most righteous nobleness-ness-ness, Lord Darius Melk?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_b_02","He doesn't like you calling him by the short version. Lord Sir Darius Melk von Melkenheim the Third or something."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_c_01","Right. I'll remember that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_one_c_02","Someone drop a bag of titles on him?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_three_b_01","Even when he says 'good morning' he sounds like he regrets letting that slip."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_three_b_02","He's like others of his kind. Too tied by the rules to engage with the living."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_three_c_01","He's just another oddly shaped piece in this puzzle."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_three_c_02","He probably just wants to get back to his paperwork."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_two_b_01","[Laugh] He knows precisely how to press your buttons, doesn't he?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_two_b_02","A pitched battle to see who's most pretentious in the offing?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_two_c_01","Let it go, Priest. Words don't win a face-to-face fight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_melk_two_c_02","[Snort of laughter]"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_four_b_01","The thought of that is making my brain itch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_four_b_02","And he's still alive? Most would've been put out their misery by now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Part organic, part metal? That's... unpleasant."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_four_c_02","No wonder he's always in a foul mood."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_a_01","I did hear tell that Morrow fought at Badab against Ol' Slobberchops Blackheart."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_a_02","Morrow fought in the Badab War. Stuff of legends, that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_a_03","So Morrow's come up against Chaos plenty of times - including against the Red Corsairs in the Badab War."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_a_04","I heard Morrow was in the Badab War. Wonder if came up against Huron Blackheart?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_b_01","He was? Those were some dark times."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Is this another 'Morrow was everywhere' tales?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Badab was then. This is now. Let's hope he's here in the present."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Some of these stories about Morrow beggar belief."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_three_b_01","A good soldier births their own legends. Morrow's no exception."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_three_b_02","A little bit of spin on the truth builds morale."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_three_c_01","It could all be lies. Frankly, I don't care."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_three_c_02","Stories mean less than deeds. Let's see what he can do."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_two_b_01","No way is he old enough to have been at Macragge."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Really? You'll be telling me next he was there the day the Emperor slew Horus."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Morrow's invincible AND immortal, huh?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_morrow_two_c_02","How come I didn't hear of him before now if he's done all this stuff?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","The Mourningstar's compact - but she's deadly."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","As ships go, she'll do."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","She's not like any other ship I've seen."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","The Captain runs her well and that's good enough for me."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Rannick? Why should he go die when he's got others to do that for him?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Watching from a safe distance is a luxury of command."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Leave him to do his thing, we do ours. Just... we do it better."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_four_c_02","I'm a soldier. The front line is where I belong."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_a_01","Can't make head nor tail of Rannick."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_a_02","Every time Rannick looks at me, I feel I'm getting sized up."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_a_03","What do you think of Rannick? Can't get under that skin at all."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_a_04","Rannick looks at me like a ship looks at a Warp storm."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_b_01","I think too much attention from him would be a bad thing."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_b_02","Don't try getting close, he'll hit you with his Inquisitorial Seal."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Follow the chain of command and just do what he says."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_one_c_02","Don't like him. Doesn't mean I won't follow orders."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_three_b_01","I'm sorry, do I look like I care what Rannick's future holds?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Grendyl's successor-in-waiting, perhaps."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_three_c_01","A man with ambition is a man to watch. Very carefully."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_three_c_02","His final destination is none of my concern."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Perhaps he just keeps the faith quietly."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Rannick's faith is between him and the Emperor, not you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_two_c_01","If you want to take it up with him, be my guest."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_rannick_two_c_02","Talk to him about it. Just leave me out of it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_a_01","Servitors have their place. Preferably wherever I am not."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_a_02","They might be unnerving, but without servitors, the Imperium would grind to a halt."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_a_03","There are a lot of servitors on the Mourningstar, aren't there?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_a_04","The servitors keep things moving, sure. Doesn't stop them creeping me out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Proof of life beyond death that I'd rather not be aware of."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_b_02","Tools. No more, no less."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_c_01","We each serve in our own way."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_servitors_one_c_02","I can't imagine that sort of existence - if it even is one."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","They are the Emperor's Angels. He made them to destroy his enemies."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","They are, and that's all that matters."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Ancient power and mysteries run in their blood."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","Armour, gene-craft, ancient weapons - that's what makes them His Angels."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_01","Space Marines, that what this situation requires."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_02","Only one real way to clean this up - the Angels of Death."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_03","Space Marines could go through this in hours."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_a_04","This is a Space Marine level of threat."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","No Angels of Death coming to help us."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","Adeptus Astartes won't get involved. These days you need a bigger mess than this."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Space Marines bring death, not salvation."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","If they come, I hope they send the Ultramarines or the Silver Skulls."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","Even if it's true, he's a long way from here..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","True or not, makes not difference here and now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Believe it's true, believe it's false, means nothing."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Even if a son of the Emperor has returned, it's not going to help this sump hole of a world."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","I have never had the chance to read such a holy text."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Soldiers in the Guard don't get to read the words of the Emperor's sons."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Right now, a fresh reload would be more use than a book."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Books and ideas are less important than guns and bullets."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_surgeon_one_c_01","[Grunt] I should have died with Cadia."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","He's a warrior, armoured and armed."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","We could not even look at Him to find out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","We die, we get to find out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","Don't need to see the Golden Throne to serve it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_a_03","Sometimes I hear the Emperor's voice in the sound of battle..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_a_04","The Emperor speaks, but does anyone hear his voice?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","You can hear Him everywhere. He roars like gunfire."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He speaks to Soldiers all the time - sounds just like your sergeant's orders."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","His will's clear, no matter what - kill the enemy."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","He's a God. His will's not for us to understand, only to obey."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Dead witches... no bad thing."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","Small price to pay."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","It's not kind, but nothing in this universe is."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","Everyone dies. At least those psykers die with purpose."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","He's fighting forever. At least we get to die."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","His sacrifice is an example to us all."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","He will endure, and so must we."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","We're not meant to understand Him. We obey. That's our job."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","I don't know and I don't want to know."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Don't know how it works, just that it does."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","No matter how it works, just be glad when it does..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Witches and mutants. It all comes down to witches and mutants."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_a_01","I never sleep in Warp travel. Things try to get into your dreams..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_a_02","Warp travel is like swimming in bad dreams..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_a_03","Hate Warp travel. You... see things at the edge of your eyes."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_a_04","Stay awake for Warp jumps. The dreams are worse than anything."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","The Warp eats ships all the time."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","The Warp can swallow a ship and never let it go."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","Good or bad jump, it's down to the Navigator. Don't like that one bit."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","Short or long, Warp jumps can always go wrong."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Only two times that matter - time to fight, or time to get ready for a fight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Nothing you can do about the time shifts, so don't bother thinking about it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","Go through the Warp enough bad things will happen. That's certain."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","If you arrive at the end of the journey count it as good."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","Warp entities... nice way of saying soul eating monsters."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Dead souls, daemons, living nightmares... call em' Warp entities if you like. Doesn't make 'em any better."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Pray and don't listen to the whispers. That's my advice."

"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","She's a Witch, Big Man. You can't trust her."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Each to their own, I suppose."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","She's obviously as smart as you are, Big Man."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","Just guard your thoughts around her. If you can."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_a_01","I never thought I'd see the day. Training with a Witch."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_a_02","The Psykhanium sets all my hairs to standing on end. Sefoni's... strange."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_a_03","I sort of feel like Sefoni sees me as something unpleasant on the sole of her boot."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_a_04","I admit to avoiding my Psykhanium training because of Sefoni. Karking Witch-kin."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","Never going to accept having to train with one of her kind."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Sefoni is one of those people who makes me aware of my station and how low it is."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","It's not my favoured training method, but needs must."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","[Muttering] Karking Witches. They get everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","Really? I try to avoid talking to her at all costs."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Wouldn't trust her further than I could comfortably spit the Ogryn."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Cold as the heart of a glacier and about as appealing."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","I will never trust her."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","Don't mind working hard when training, but why her?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","Witches and soldiers ain't a happy mix. Well, not for this soldier."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Don't like her, but she is an acceptable trainer. Don't tell her I said so."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","Needs must. That's how it is."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Orbital drops are fine. It's the landings that shake you up."

"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Get used to it. It's not like you have a choice."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","You'll get the hang of it. Or we'll all die screaming. Either is a solution."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_war_end_b_01","Stay fast, believe in the Imperium and we will see victory."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_war_end_b_02","War doesn't end. It just takes a breath before the next plunge."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_war_end_c_01","War is all I've ever known. Suppose it's all I ever will."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_war_end_c_02","Our orders are to fight. So let's just focus on that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_four_b_01","It's possible."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Xenos hybrids? Anything is possible."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_four_c_01","I've heard about cults that worship aliens."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_four_c_02","Cults, hybrids, heretics, xenos - all have to be killed just the same."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_one_a_01","Heretics have objectives you can understand. Xenos... they're something else."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_one_a_03","Xenos conflict - never want to see one again."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_one_b_01","Doesn't matter who the enemy is, job's the same - kill them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Aliens, heretics, witches, all the same when they're in your sights."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_one_c_01","Aliens, traitors, doesn't matter - we fight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_one_c_02","Aim, fire, next shot - that's all I need to know about an enemy."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_three_b_01","These are questions that help us exactly zero here and now."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_three_c_01","Weapons are only as good as the flesh and bone behind them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_three_c_02","I have the weapons I need."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_two_b_01","They're dangerous. Very dangerous."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_two_b_02","Blink fast and razor edged - that's them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_two_c_01","The Aeldari are dying. Chaos is the real threat."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_xenos_two_c_02","Forget the Aeldari. We have an enemy to face already."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_four_b_01","I respect her strength and skill."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_four_b_02","She knows what she wants and nothing gets in her way."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_four_c_01","Atoma is lucky to have her. Perhaps we are, too."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_four_c_02","Just be sure not to cross her. It'd be the last thing you did."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_a_01","I think if the explicator relaxed a little, she'd be more relatable."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_a_02","Zola may not be fun and games, but she's strong and focused. I like it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_a_03","I reckon there's more heart to Zola than she lets on."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_a_04","Zola may seem cold and heartless, but I don't think that's the case."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_b_01","War's no place to show heart."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_b_02","I bet she'd open up after an amasec or two."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_c_01","She has goals and goes straight for them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_one_c_02","As long as keeping a stone face doesn't cause her to crack."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_three_b_01","The lower the station the higher the will to survive."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_three_b_02","Never underestimate the will of the low-born to survive."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_three_c_01","I've known worse. Far worse."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_three_c_02","She's better than some of the others, for sure."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_two_b_01","My faith isn't lacking. My patience is."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_two_b_02","A good show of faith gets you far in the right places."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_two_c_01","Zola's faith is strong enough for us all."
"loc_veteran_male_c__lore_zola_two_c_02","I'll admit, Zola's strength of purpose is inspiring."

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Where do you suppose this data will lead?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","This data? Where do you think it will end?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","Servitor city. Big ones. Small ones. Creeps me out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Place runs smoothly, I guess. Mostly because of the servitors."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","No room to manoeuvre in here. Stay tight."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","This place is a death trap."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Better way would be to use the train."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Would be easier to drive the train out of here."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Copy that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Understood."

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Answer like that tells me all I need to know."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Evasive... You hiding something?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Reinforcements need to be here."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Support team had better be sharp."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","They're not here yet. That's all I need to know."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","A good support team would be here already."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Industrious place. Good. The war is always hungry."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","Busy workers can't do the daemon's work..."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","This is a maze."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","Difficult to navigate in here."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Something large and hostile made that hole."

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","They were scum."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The heretics took over the Water Cartel fast. Surprising."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Cartel were hollowed out quickly.  Must have been weak to the bone."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","The weak always leave themselves open to corruption."

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","You got a story, Explicator?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","I hear that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Understood."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Water Cartel, insignia. These are mercenaries."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Real soldiers fight for the Imperium not a 'Cartel'."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","Life down here means sifting muck for something to eat."

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cartel_shanty_01","Hard living down here."

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","Something stinks about this. Why go to all this trouble?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","There are traitors everywhere."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Traitors, everywhere I turn. About time I cleared them out."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","Who's getting eyes on our transmission?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","Where's this transmission headed anyway?"

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Worthy cause. I approve."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Good intel is worth more than diamantine."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Something about this mission stinks."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Reckon we're being kept in the dark on this one."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_complex_way_in_01","Eyes on an ingress point!"

"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Better to die with a gun in your hand."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","There's worse end's, but not many."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","How important for the war is this place?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","This place is vital for the war, yes?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Thought so."
"loc_veteran_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Let's get it done then."

"loc_veteran_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_01","Don't look at me. I'm not dragging you back."
"loc_veteran_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_02","Your problem is you just want attention."
"loc_veteran_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_03","Oh for pity's sake ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_04","I might have known you'd go down again ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__player_death_adamant_01","It's going to be a bit quieter without that Provost."
"loc_veteran_male_b__player_death_adamant_02","The Provost's gone. Looting season's open again!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__player_death_adamant_03","I suppose the Provost wasn't ALL bad."

"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_04","Hold on! I'm a bit busy!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_01","Please don't die. I'll be so sad."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_02","Oh no ... My heart's breaking, it is."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_03","Doesn't look like much of a wound to me."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_04","That looks deep. You might even die. Can I have your boots?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","That looks nasty!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Face full of dog slobber!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Better kick that dog loose, someone!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","We'd better interrupt that meal!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_01","Help's coming! I think."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_02","Bet you wish you'd been nicer to me now!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_03","Be right there, Arbitrator sir ... ma'am ... whatever ..."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_04","We'll get to you! Just hang tight!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_05","Anyone gonna help 'em?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_06","Yeah. The Lex can only do so much."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_01","You do good work, I can't deny."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_02","That's not a bad kill, Provost."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_03","Of course, we all know that I did the hard part."
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_04","Feeling better for killing that thing, Provost?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_01","We heard you! Have some karking patience!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_02","Things are a bit busy. Had you noticed?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_03","We'll be right with you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_04","Have a bit of patience, for Throne's sake!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_01","On it! Don't drop!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_02","You don't wanna look down!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_03","I pity whoever's below!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_04","Someone better grab the Provost!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_05","Can anyone grab the Provost!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_06","I think I can see you slipping!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_veteran_01","That's why they keep me around!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_veteran_02","I'm the best! Never doubt it!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_veteran_03","This? This is karking nothing!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_veteran_04","You're jealous! I can always tell!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_01","Yeah, we'll get right to you!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_02","We're a little busy here!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_03","Someone give the Provost a hand!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_04","Oh, so NOW you need me?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_05","Keep it together, would you?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_06","Find some cover!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_seen_killstreak_adamant_01","When you're hot you're hot!"
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_seen_killstreak_adamant_02","What's going on? Do they owe you money?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_seen_killstreak_adamant_03","The Provost's gone mad. Well MORE mad."
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_seen_killstreak_adamant_04","Always thought that Provost was a little bit crazy."
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_start_revive_adamant_01","This had better get me time off for good behaviour."
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_start_revive_adamant_02","Bet you're glad I'm around now."
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_start_revive_adamant_03","Look at this, me helping you out of a jam."
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_start_revive_adamant_04","You've looked better."
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_start_revive_adamant_05","Let's be having you, yeah?"
"loc_veteran_male_b__veteran_start_revive_adamant_06","Sleeping on duty? Should be on a charge for that."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_01_b_01","Can't be done. Not with this team. "
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_03_b_01","Not until the war's done."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_04_b_01","You're not wrong."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_07_b_01","Agreed. Stand together or fall alone."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_16_b_01","I don't take orders from you."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_17_b_01","We will none of us be missed."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_01_b_01","Does not matter. We have a job to do."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_03_b_01","We're a tool to get a job done. Don't overthink it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_04_b_01","This whole hive stinks of heresy. You can't escape it."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_07_b_01","They're not enough. They can never be enough."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_16_b_01","We will show them defeat."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_17_b_01","It's a warzone. Nothing else matters."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_01_b_01","If they're in my sights, they're dead."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_05_b_01","Purged. Burned. Levelled. And burned again. No half measures."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_09_b_01","Copy that. Point me at the target."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_13_b_01","There is no other way."
"loc_veteran_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_17_b_01","Order and courage. That's the Cadian way."
"loc_veteran_male_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_01","Ammo here, Provost!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_02","Got ammo here, Arbitrator!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_03","Take the ammo, Provost!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_04","I have eyes on ammo, Provost!"

"loc_veteran_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_veteran_01","Watch your fire, Provost!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_veteran_02","Trying aiming, Provost!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_veteran_03","Who led your training, Arbitrator?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_veteran_04","Aim straight, Provost!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_veteran_05","Want me to take that weapon off you, Arbitrator?"
"loc_veteran_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_veteran_06","Provost! You shot me!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_01","Never send a Provost to do a soldier's job."
"loc_veteran_male_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_02","You keep falling over, the time will come when you don't get up."
"loc_veteran_male_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_03","Again? YOU are a burden."
"loc_veteran_male_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_04","Arbitrator's down. Try to act surprised."
"loc_veteran_male_c__player_death_adamant_01","Arbitrator's dead. Stay on mission."
"loc_veteran_male_c__player_death_adamant_02","Provost's out. We'll get it done without them."
"loc_veteran_male_c__player_death_adamant_03","Provost's gone. We'll manage."
"loc_veteran_male_c__player_death_adamant_04","We've lost a Provost. We've still got our duty."
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_01","Provost's calling for suppressing fire!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_02","Suppressing fire on the Provost's location! Now!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_03","Keep those heretics' heads down!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_04","Light them up! Give the Provost breathing room!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_01","Endure or succumb. Doesn't matter to me."
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_02","Wounds close. Scars fade. The fight goes on."
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_03","Cherish the pain. "
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_04","Pain gives purpose."
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Kill that Hound!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Get the Provost clear of those teeth!"
"loc_veteran_male_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Target the Hound. Now!"
