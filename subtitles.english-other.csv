"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_01","Might I be of service?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_02","You could use a new look."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_03","Do you fancy something a little different?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_04","You look fresh off a penal ship. Let me help you with that."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_05","You've no style, but I can help."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_06","Look at you. I can make you so much better ..."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_07","You need a barber. Don't be shy ..."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_08","If ever there was a dreg who needed a barber, it's you ..."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_09","Don't be afraid of the shears. I've a steady hand. I promise."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_10","Roll up! Roll up! Find a new face! A new hair style!"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_11","That nose of yours could use a little work."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_12","I can make you look like a hero!"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_13","No finer augmetics in the Imperium, and that's a promise!"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_14","You! Yes, you! Let me do something about those ears!"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_15","Don't be wary! I can give you a whole new outlook. Heh."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_16","Need a little work done? Step right this way!"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_17","Need a little work doing? I can fit you in."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_18","Patronised by Grendyl, am I. You can trust my shears."
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_19","Look at you ... No style at all. Let's fix that!"
"loc_barber_a__barber_distance_20","Barber's services! Haircuts! Face sculpting! Body art!"
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_01","Come back any time."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_02","I'm always open."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_03","Leaving so soon?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_04","Tell your friends ... if you have any."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_05","You don't have to go ... unless you want."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_06","All good things come to an end, eh?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_07","Do come back."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_08","I'll see you again soon."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_09","You'll be back. They always are."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_10","Now you be careful. Lots of shady characters about."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_11","Be careful down there. Heretics have no sense of style."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_12","Nice talking to you."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_13","I think I'll be seeing more of you."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_14","You won't be away long, I trust?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_15","Ah. Parting so soon."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_16","What's the rush?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_17","Goodbye. Do come again."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_18","If you have to go, you have to go."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_19","Well, don't let me keep you."
"loc_barber_a__barber_goodbye_20","See you again. I'm sure of it."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_01","Hello there."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_02","Ah ... A new customer."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_03","Don't worry. I'll keep both legs the same length."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_04","Just how attached are you to those arms?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_06","Hello."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_07","What can I do for you?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_08","A pleasure to serve ... slice ... stitch ..."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_09","Heh. I knew you'd be coming."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_10","Ah-hah. And what can I do for you?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_11","Glad you decided to stop by."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_12","Ah ... Yes. You do need my services."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_13","And what would you like?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_14","A little off the top ... or something more?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_15","Ah! A customer. Take a seat."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_16","Another customer. Busy day."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_17","It's been such a rush today, but I think I can fit you in."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_18","Let's see what we can do with you."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_19","Heh. You were expected."
"loc_barber_a__barber_hello_20","Let's get you looking fit to take on the world. Any world."
"loc_barber_a__barber_intro_a_01","My name’s Krall. Oska Krall. I specialise in new outlooks on life. Don’t like your ears, your hair, your nose?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_intro_b_01","I can fix that … for a price. Make you the talk of the Mourningstar."
"loc_barber_a__barber_intro_c_01","Your personality though? There you’re on your own."
"loc_barber_a__barber_intro_d_01","I’m good, but I can’t work miracles … whatever Hallowette might tell you."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_01","Yes ... I think I can work with you."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_02","An excellent choice."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_03","Oh, very dashing."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_04","You'll be the envy of the Mourningstar."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_05","Won't that look nice?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_06","Hold still. We don't want any accidents."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_07","Well, there's no accounting for taste."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_08","You know, that's a popular choice."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_09","Interesting ... but I suppose you'll be noticed."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_10","Oh yes, I always enjoy that one."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_11","Please don't cry out. I have a delicate disposition."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_12","No ... No ... I'm sure that will look just fine."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_13","Not what I'd have chosen, but you're the customer."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_14","An ... unusual choice."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_15","Oh yes. This will be good."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_16","You're the boss."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_17","Let's get started, eh?"
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_18","Heh. I thought that was what you wanted."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_19","It's a pleasure to serve someone who knows what they want."
"loc_barber_a__barber_purchase_20","Really? Well, we can always try this again."
"loc_barber_a__hub_intro_barber_a_01","Well ... hello my friend! So you received my invitation?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_intro_barber_b_01","Even in the thick of war, it's not all marching around, shooting and shouting, you know. There's still room for art, heh?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_intro_barber_c_01","Not for Oska Krall the mediums of parchment or cold stone, no no no. "
"loc_barber_a__hub_intro_barber_d_01","I sculpt in blood and bone. Peeling back fleshy illusion to reveal shining truth hidden within."
"loc_barber_a__hub_intro_barber_e_01","So many truths. So difficult to bring to the surface, but I persevere. The craft demands it."
"loc_barber_a__hub_intro_barber_f_01","Together, we will make a masterpiece of you. You'll see."
"loc_barber_a__hub_intro_barber_g_01","And if we don't succeed? ... Well, there's always tomorrow."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_01","If you ask me, the war will not stay contained for long."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_02","It is war. War does not end, it only escalates. And spreads, you hear what I am saying?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_03","More soldiers arrive daily. Good for business, bad for fighters, eh?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_04","A closely contained battle can only be contained for a while. Then... boom! War everywhere. "
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_05","Mark my words. This is just the beginning."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_06","Where do I think this will end? I will tell you. More fighting. That's where."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_07","Today a battle, tomorrow a war... where will it end?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_08","Every day the outlook gets a little more bleak. More rahzvod, I think."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_09","Some months ago, they said this whole thing would be over in weeks."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_10","Things will only get worse. May as well get used to it."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_01","Keep your ears open. I don't think everything here is as it seems."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_02","I would say ""travel safely, friend"", but... heh. "
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_03","See you again. And you will be back, I guarantee it."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_04","Are you sure I can't take a few years off the top for you? Ah, well."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_05","Always here. Medical services, rejuvenat treatments and all the hot news."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_06","Don't die out there, eh? I can work with most damage, but death is harder to fix. [Raucous laughter]"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_07","If you find any Amasec down-hive, we can talk trade, yes?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_08","Be sure to come back. Your credits are always welcome. And any rahzvod you find."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_09","Off you go, then. Don't worry. I'll be here. Where else would I go?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_farewell_a_10","Have fun. Is that the wrong thing to say? In that case, have fun!"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_01","I would not trust Hadron further than I could throw her. Which is not far, to be clear."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_02","Even the medicae servitors here are keeping secrets. "
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_03","I would not trust anything Melk might have for sale. Who knows what tank it fell off?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_04","The Shipmistress looks good. I could make her look better."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_05","Morrow would benefit from rejuvenat treatment. He looks tired."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_06","I have much time for that nice pilot. She is smart. Very smart."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_07","I don't have an opinion on the Inquisitor. Not one I can speak aloud."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_08","I like Morrow. I feel like we are cut from the same cloth."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_10","Best advice for dealing with the Inquisitor is to keep your head down. Right down. Between your knees, if possible."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_01","Nothing to see at the Moebian Fringe but corpses and nothing to do but die."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_02","The Moebian Fringe. Come for the horror, stay because you'll end up part of it."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_03","If the galaxy had an armpit, the Moebian Fringe would be it."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_04","I've not been to the Moebian Fringe. But even the rumours are enough to make sure I never go."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_05","You want to know about the Moebian Fringe? Go check the waste disposal. Instant simulation."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_06","Even the bacteria want to get away from the Fringe."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_07","You want to see what actual hel is like? Head to the Moebian Fringe."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_08","Nothing good ever came out of the Moebian Fringe. "
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_09","Look up ""bleak"" and the Moebian Fringe will be the definition."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_moebian_fringe_01_a_10","The Moebian Fringe is bleak. Blasted. Not a good place to be or to be from."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_01","Eh, nobility. Stab you in the back soon as look at you. Good spenders, though. Vain."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_02","Noble houses all squabble like children to see who is most important. Truth is, none of them are."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_03","Politics is a poor spectator sport played by inept competitors. "
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_04","Lord Margrave is bad news. The worst kind of news."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_05","My advice is sit back and watch the nobles slug it out for top spot."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_06","The higher the noble, the further they have to fall."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_07","Lord Margrave does not serve any interests but his own."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_08","""Noble allies"" is a contradiction in terms. "
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_09","Noble is more than just a title. It is also what you do."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_10","Eh, politics does not make for interesting gossip. What the nobles get up to, though..."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_01","Since security stepped up, business is down. Bad business, no?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_02","They tell me strange things are afeet. Afoot? Whatever. What do you know?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_03","Things go missing. Anybody tries to steal my tools, it will not be pretty for them."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_04","Increased patrols. Tighter security. Stock scrutiny. Bad times. Very bad."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_05","Don't trust anybody. Except me. I am fully trustworthy, heh."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_06","To trust the wrong person once is unfortunate. Do it again and chances are good you won't do it a third time."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_07","Several people have gone missing. They keep telling us it's nothing to worry about. So we do."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_08","If security gets any tighter, we'll all choke."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_09","Eyes are everywhere and they aren't always friendly ones. Be cautious."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_traitor_01_a_10","There's a fine line between safety and paranoia if you ask me."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_01","Wolfer... Wolfer... oh, you would not believe the things I hear."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_03","Where there's trouble, there's usually Wolfer. Not always. Just usually."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_04","Wolfer is trouble. That's all you need to know."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_05","They say that the best strategy when facing Wolfer is to not be facing him, you know?"
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_06","Of course I hear things about Wolfer. But some things even I won't repeat."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_08","Someone like Wolfer needs to surround himself with expendables."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_09","I could tell you everything I know about Wolfer, but I don't know that much."
"loc_barber_a__hub_rumour_wolfer_01_a_10","Wolfer? Wolfer. Oh yes. I know of Wolfer. And his flock of fanatics. No real details, of course."
"loc_barber_a__info_event_almost_done_a_01","Almost there!"
"loc_barber_a__info_event_almost_done_a_02","Just a little more ..."
"loc_barber_a__info_event_almost_done_a_03","You are almost done. Excellent!"
"loc_barber_a__info_event_almost_done_a_04","Keep at it! Not long now!"
"loc_barber_a__info_event_one_down_a_01","That's one!"
"loc_barber_a__info_event_one_down_a_02","That's a good start!"
"loc_barber_a__info_event_one_down_a_03","The first step is the hardest, neh?"
"loc_barber_a__info_event_one_down_a_04","We are underway!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_city_view_b_01","Streets like these are never as quiet as they appear."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_city_view_b_02","Quiet on the surface, but it won't last."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_city_view_b_03","It's all a mask, concealing the ravaging rot beneath."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_closer_a_01","You're getting closer. I can almost smell the illicit trade ..."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_closer_a_02","Yes ... You're on the right path. Illicit dealings as far as the eye can see."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_closer_a_03","You're on the trail now. I have a special sense for illicit trade. Installed it myself!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_closer_c_01","True. But I have a good feeling about this."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_closer_c_02","Life's too short to be cynical. I have faith in your team."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_closer_c_03","It will be fine. I'm almost certain that we're on the right trail."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_b_01","Yes, she almost shed a tear."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_b_02","A clever little trap. I'm quite envious."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_b_03","I tried to warn you. Why bring me if you don't listen?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_a_01","Aha! That is the one."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_a_02","That is the place."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_a_03","That saloon. That is the one."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_a_04","That saloon, there."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_c_01","Central location, but not too central. Showy, but not eye-catching."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_c_02","It's covered in Slinker Argot. You need to know what to look for. Also need the right kind of eyes."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_c_04","You said it yourself: I have a nose for this sort of thing. Chose it special. Heh."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_b_01","This is too easy. I would never leave my workshop so exposed."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_b_02","You don't feel there should be more defences? This feels too easy."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_b_03","If we're so close, why aren't the heretics fighting harder?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_b_01","Nothing wrong with thinking big."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_b_02","Ah, the things I could do with facilities like this ..."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_b_03","With profit all things are possible."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_a_01","So very unhygienic. You'd never catch me performing my craft under these conditions."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_a_02","Seeping walls, mould ... all this filth. It makes my skin itch."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_a_03","These are hardly sterile conditions. Cleanliness costs nothing."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_c_01","Alas, it is my fate to be forever misjudged."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_c_02","Unkind, explicator. Very unkind."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_c_03","An artist is never appreciated in his own lifetime."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_03_a_01","I wouldn't expect more ""locked door"" surprises. They won't have expected you to get this far."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_03_a_02","Hah! They don't seem ready for you. What a terrible shame."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_03_a_03","No self-respecting criminal allows his adversaries so deep into his lair. Or so I am told."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_a_01","This won't slow them down much. They'll rebuild."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_a_02","The heretics are bound to rebuild. I would."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_a_03","A few explosions won't shut this operation down."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_01","These facilities may not be top of the line, but they are very practical."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_02","The ""match and mend"" improvisation of these facilities really is quite something."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_03","Such primitive machinery, and yet the heretics have made it function. Impressive."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_a_01","I'm not complaining, you understand, but I still don't know what I'm doing here."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_a_02","Not that I'm reluctant to help ... but why am I here?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_a_03","I am always happy to help the Inquisition of course, but why now?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_c_01","I am an entirely legitimate businessman, explicator."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_c_02","Unkind. Very unkind. I am a pillar of respectability."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_c_03","Someone has been telling lies about me again. [Sigh] Unhappy customers and wagging tongues."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_e_01","Only I hope it won't take long. I have a body ... I mean a customer ... waiting on the slab."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_e_02","Such a busy day. Never mind. I'm sure my patrons will understand."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_e_03","The timing isn't ideal. Still, it's always a pleasure to serve."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_streets_b_01","A protection racket is a protection racket. It doesn't matter who enforces it."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_streets_b_02","Hope is expensive in streets like this. Loyalty even more so."
"loc_barber_a__mission_raid_streets_b_03","Easier to submit and hope for salvation, I expect."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_b_01","The sanctum behind my surgery. Morrow won't find me there."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_b_02","The confessional. It's the last place Morrow will look for me."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_b_03","One of Hallowette's smuggling compartments. The air is regrettably thin."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_01","You know, this would go faster if you all had longer legs."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_02","Are those weapons heavy? Maybe I could do something useful to your arms."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_03","Your aim could be better. I might have just the eyes for that."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_01","I thought it would be over by now. I might take a little nap."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_02","You aren't finished yet? ... Not that I'm complaining, you understand."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_03","This is all very invigorating, but it's taking a long time. Can you go faster?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_01","You look out of breath. Perhaps I could make some improvements for you?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_02","So many heretics ... Makes it very hard for honest businessmen to do their work."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_03","These heretics really don't know when to take a hint, neh?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_01","That blast gate's sealed tight ... but I'm sure you can open it."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_02","The blast gate doesn't look ready to open, does it?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_03","Ah, the heretics have sealed the blast gate. Better think of something."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_01","A shame that tank is sealed. There might still be ... useful raw materials inside."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_02","I still say that a tank of flesh and bone would be more practical than one of metal."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_03","You will tell me if you see any salvageable body parts? They're always useful."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_01_b_01","He didn't look to be in a flexible frame of mind. "
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_02_b_01","What if it doesn't work? It will only make him more angry."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_03_a_01","Morrow is a very ill-tempered man. "
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_03_c_01","Somehow I think it probably does, but have it your way."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_b_01","Just bring the package to the valkyrie. I'll handle things from there ... and say nothing to Morrow."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_b_02","As long as you bring the package to the valkyrie, I can make the rest happen. And not a word to Morrow!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_b_03","And remember: Morrow need know nothing of this. Just leave the package on the valkyrie and keep a still tongue, neh?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_b_01","Untrue! There is some kind of ... manifestation interfering with the systems. "
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_b_02","Not I! The auspex suggests a daemonic manifestation is present!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_b_03","The auspex reads a daemonic presence ... which is nothing to do with me!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_01","Revolting thing. I wouldn't graft its appendages to my worst enemy."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_02","Unnatural, ugly and unhappily tenacious. Excellent work."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_03","Hah! That should solve the issue."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_01","I'm sure nothing else will go wrong!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_02","That's the end of the trouble, I'm sure!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_03","Nothing in the world can stop you now!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_01","There! It still works."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_02","Good. The heretics haven't damaged it."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_03","Excellent. I was worried that it wouldn't work."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_01","Here we are at last. And just in time!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_02","We - I mean you - are here! Excellent!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_03","There you are! Just where you need to be."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_b_01","Capture the Ascension Riser, then it can take you and the merchandise to safety, neh?"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_b_02","It's very simple: capture the Ascension Riser and the merchandise, then head for safety."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_b_03","Once you have captured the Ascension Riser, you're as good as home. Trust me."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_01","Excellent work! You can open the gate now."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_02","That's very impressive. Now all you need do is open the gate."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_03","Just the gate to open now!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_c_01","For now ... Morrow was called away."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_c_02","Perhaps not for long. I suspect Morrow will be back."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_c_03","Did you ever doubt it? I think I am offended."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_01","The power's off? Good! Nothing to worry about."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_02","There's no power to those tracks. I checked ... At least, I think I did."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_03","The tracks have no power. That's what I was told, anyway."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_01","You know, I think it's time to leave."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_02","Time to come back to the ship. I will have some recaff waiting."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_03","No need to linger. Come back to the Mourningstar while you can!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_maze_a_01","Please hurry. Morrow just came by my surgery. He suspects."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_maze_a_02","That was a close one. Morrow was just here. I hid until he was gone. Heroically."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_maze_a_03","Morrow is definitely suspicious. He was just here. Gave me a look. I'm not a good liar."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_01","Rather you than me. I have a terrible head for heights."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_02","That bridge ... I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_03","No amount of surgery can remove vertigo. I know, I've tried."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_c_01","A kind offer, but I like to know my own thoughts."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_c_02","I fear it has been part of me too long. I wouldn't be ""me"" without it."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_c_03","No no no. Burdens are the markers of greatness. I would not lessen myself for the world."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_siding_b_01","Wait ... I think Morrow's coming back ..."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_siding_b_02","Oh no. Morrow is walking this way again ..."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_siding_b_03","Keep walking, Morrow ... There is nothing of interest here ... "
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_start_b_01","Let's make this fast. I have a waiting list as long as my fourth ... no, fifth ... favourite arm."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_start_b_02","We need to do this fast. That would be good."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_start_b_03","I feel like they should be moving faster. Move faster please!"
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_start_d_01","I know ... only, I'd rather we were done before Morrow noticed."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_start_d_02","I just don't want us to get caught. Morrow is a very suspicious man."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_start_d_03","Easy for you to say. It's me that Morrow threatened ..."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_01","Do hurry. The idea is to catch the heretics by surprise."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_02","If you do not hurry, the heretics will be gone and their goods hidden."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_03","Faster, please. This is all for nothing if the heretics have already hidden the goods."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_01","The subrails? An excellent smuggler's route."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_02","These subrails are an excellent way to move contraband. Not that I would, of course."
"loc_barber_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_03","These subrails aren't the only secret ways in this part of Tertium. Not at all."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_01","Earn His grace."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_02","You have much for which to atone."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_03","Your redemption will be a long road."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_04","You are unworthy until proven otherwise."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_05","You will not be missed."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_06","Strive for forgiveness, sinner."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_07","Farewell, sinner."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_08","Come back ... or not. It matters little."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_09","Farewell, directionless one."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_10","Farewell, lightless one."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_11","I hope you find grace."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_12","Find solace in service."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_13","Begone, penitent."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_14","I would pray for you, if I thought it would change anything."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_15","You are lost. Find grace."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_16","Your insignificance is your own doing."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_17","Hope remains, sinner."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_18","Earn His favour ... if you can."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_19","Light comes from within."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_20","Faith. Find it ... and perhaps there is hope for you."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_01","Walk in the Emperor's Light."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_02","Farewell."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_03","Carry His light into the darkness."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_04","Emperor walk with you."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_05","Saint Messalina preserve you."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_06","Let hatred guide you."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_07","Be forever in His light."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_08","May you remain strong."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_09","Bless you, pilgrim."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_10","Please ... stay safe."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_11","Never give up, pilgrim."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_12","He loves you, pilgrim."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_13","We are the righteous, you and I."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_14","Onwards to glory."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_15","Never doubt Him."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_16","You will triumph. I just know it."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_17","You are a hero of Terra. Never forget that."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_18","This is holy work. Never forget that."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_19","You are my inspiration."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__boon_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_20","Please ... may I touch you? I wish to share your blessing."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_01_a_01","You should practice politeness, Sire Melk. We depend on these rejects."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_02_a_01","Praise the Emperor in all things!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_03_a_01","Do not falter, Sire Melk. Atoma will be free."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_04_a_01","How goes the day, Sire Melk?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_05_a_01","Things may seem bleak, but we shall overcome."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_06_a_01","Do you not ever sleep?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_07_a_01","I wish I could join the strike teams."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_08_a_01","Will Grendyl ever join us here, do you suppose?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_09_a_01","I hear we lost another strike team."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_10_a_01","I dreamed of the Emperor last night. A good omen."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_11_b_01","I am not staring at you. You are standing in my staring place."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_12_b_01","All the more reason to show them some kindness."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_13_b_01","I can look after myself."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_14_b_01","I find them abhorrent, but necessary."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_15_b_01","A reject stole it. She has been ... reprimanded."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_16_b_01","I will certainly ask. For now, I will do things my way."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_17_b_01","I'm surprised you can remember. It must be such a long time ago."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_18_b_01","Blessed Throne, may the Emperor deliver us."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_19_b_01","Spare us your portentous mutterings, please."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_20_b_01","Or any tactics at all, perhaps?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_a_01","Hold your ground! No mercy!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_a_02","Stand fast, for the Emperor sees our deeds!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_a_03","Do not falter! Do not fail! Fight on!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_kill_all_a_01","Eradicate these heretics! Let none survive!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_kill_all_a_02","Purge the battle zone! Let hatred be your guide!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_kill_all_a_03","Slay them all! No fear! No mercy! No retreat!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_a_01","Let the landing beacon shine out!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_a_02","Activate the landing beacon!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_a_03","Let the cry go out! Signal for reinforcements! "
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_penance_greeting_a_01","Tell me of your deeds, so that I may record them."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_penance_greeting_a_02","Tell me ... What penances have you undertaken lately?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_penance_greeting_a_03","Speak to me of your accomplishments."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_penance_greeting_a_04","Through service, we atone for our sins."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_penance_greeting_a_05","Atonement is the very worthiest of goals."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_penance_greeting_a_06","Let me guide you in the act of penance."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_01","Watch your back. You can't trust anyone around here."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_02","Invisible forces are in motion all around us. When the time comes, choose the right side."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_03","Don't be fooled. The noble houses of Tertium are not friends ... they are barely allies."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_04","Even at peace, Tertium festers with bad blood. At war? It will get much worse."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_05","We both serve Grendyl, yes. But there are higher causes."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_06","Tertium needs all the help it can get. It will receive little from its ""noble"" lord."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_07","A dagger behind every smile, that's Tertium. Stay out of politics, should it call."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_08","Trust is earned, not given ... and easily stolen. I learned that the hard way."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_09","Lord Margrave is not your friend. Stand in his way, and he will crush you."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_interact_rumour_politics_a_10","Lord Margrave styles himself Tertium's saviour. But at what price?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_intro_penance_a_01","Soldiers of the Blessed Emperor, I am Hestia Prine, a Daughter of Messelina and representative of the Holy Inquisition."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_intro_penance_b_01","It is my solemn duty to stand in witness to your deeds and to record the penances you undertake. "
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_intro_penance_c_01","History shall remember the martyrs who fell in Atoma's defence."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_intro_penance_d_01","May Saint Messelina walk ever beside you in the Emperor's Light."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__hub_intro_penance_e_01","Though it take a lifetime of blood and strife, Atoma shall be free."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_archive_a_01","Archivum Sycorax? It will wait for another day."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_archive_a_02","Alas that we have no time to enter the Archivum. Perhaps another time."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_archive_a_03","The Archivum is not our target this day. Hold to our task."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_bridge_down_a_01","The way is open. Onwards to glory!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_bridge_down_a_02","Your path is clear. March on in the Emperor's name!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_bridge_down_a_03","One trial is ended. The next begins. Meet it with glad heart."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_01","Praise the Emperor! The power is restored."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_02","The Emperor is with us. Already the mechanism hums with power."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_03","You have restored power and purpose. Exemplary."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_a_01","Lieutenant Masozi says that I am to remind you to shut off the skyfire."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_a_02","Disable the skyfire. I would hate for you to be stranded."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_a_03","Have a care to disable the skyfire. Extraction requires it."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_c_01","Tertium's leaders abandoned them long ago. "
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_c_02","The Emperor loves them still ... even if others do not."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_c_03","We should pity them. Heresy spreads out of neglect as much as wickedness."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_b_01","No! These citizens need our aid."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_b_02","There are yet faithful sheltering here."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_b_03","We must not abandon the faithful!"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_a_01","I believe that comprises all the samples in this area."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_a_02","Those samples should suffice, sergeant-major."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_a_03","Thank you, strike team. We now have sufficient samples."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_a_01","Blessed Emperor, forgive us for failing these citizens."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_a_02","Blessed Emperor, receive the souls of the righteous dead with favour."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_a_03","Blessed Emperor, let retribution find the despoilers of this, your domain."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_a_01","These citizens expected protection, and how was their trust repaid?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_a_02","Vigilance lapsed, and now these citizens are dead. Emperor have mercy."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_a_03","These deaths were avoidable. The hive Administratum had a duty to these souls."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_c_01","I cannot answer for the interrogator's desires ... excellency."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_c_02","The interrogator's will is his own, excellency. I do but serve."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_market_c_03","His mind does not reveal itself to me, excellency."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_b_01","These people were abandoned. We should not repeat the mistake."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_b_02","Surely it falls to us to restore hope?"
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_b_03","The inhabitants were forgotten. Little wonder they grew desperate."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_b_01","And it will be destroyed. Strike team, your biotic probes are now capable of delivering the unguent of shriving. Deploy them."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_b_02","And we shall end it. Strike team, deploy your biotic probes. Let the blessed unguent of shriving flow."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_b_03","Strike team? Your biotic probes are now capable of delivering the blessed unguent of shriving. Deploy them and standby."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_b_01","You do them an injustice, excellency."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_b_02","I can vouch for their ability, excellency."
"loc_boon_vendor_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_b_03","Their records are ... impressive, excellency."

"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_01","Retrieve the cypher-ident, and be quick about it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_02","That cypher-ident is not about to retrieve itself."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_03","The servitors should offer up the cypher-ident ... with a little persuasion."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_04","You can extract the cypher-ident from the servitors ... or should be able to."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_end_01","You have acquired the samples. Now get out of there."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_end_02","You've acquired the contagion samples. Now to get yourself out of there."

"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_end_04","You got in. You got the samples. Now... get out."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_01","Don't dawdle. Search those chambers for the contagion samples."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_02","The contagion samples are in one of those chambers. Find there."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_03","The contagion samples are here somewhere."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_04","The contagion stores, at last. Get what we came for. With haste, if you would."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_01","You've reached the Excise Vault. Get inside."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_02","Find the release for the Excise Vault."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_03","Get the Excise Vault open and get inside."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_04","There must be a release for the Excise Vault somewhere."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_01_b_01","And what, pray, is the point of giving them airs?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_02_b_01","Indeed, praise him!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_03_b_01","Indeed it shall ... so long as these rejects play their part."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_04_b_01","As expected ... but it shouldn't get any worse than that."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_05_b_01","If you say so. I imagine they will get a good bit bleaker yet."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_06_b_01","Sleep is for the young ... and the dead."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_07_b_01","That is not advisable. You're worth more to the cause precisely where you are."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_08_b_01","Very likely, but only when we least expect him."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_09_b_01","We lost a good deal more than that."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_10_b_01","We'll need more than omens to win this war."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_11_a_01","I'll thank you not to stare at me like that."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_12_a_01","Do not grow attached to the rejects. They won't be here long."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_13_a_01","Should you wander the ship, take a bodyguard with you at all times."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_14_a_01","I hear you're interested in Atoman politics?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_15_a_01","Did we ever find out what happened to that missing tome?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_16_a_01","Should you ever need to draw upon my experience--"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_17_a_01","Of course, all this was easier back in my day."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_18_a_01","Things look desperate, I suppose, but we'll turn this around."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_19_a_01","Hmmmm. I don't like that. I don't like that at all."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__concourse_exchange_20_a_01","I think it may be time to consider new tactics."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_01","Oh, make yourself useful. There are plenty of contracts needs doing."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_02","You look like someone who needs to prove themselves. I have just the thing."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_03","I understand you've yet to earn your place. Let me help with that."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_04","Would you care to undertake a contract? That is, if you're not too busy."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_05","The Emperor demands you undertake a contract. No, don't question ... just come here."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_06","Contracts are important. You are not ... but perhaps through toil?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_07","I don't expect much of you, but this contract needs doing."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_08","Don't dawdle! Report to me for a suitable contract at once!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_09","Hurry along now! It is your duty to complete contracts ... and my pleasure to assign them."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_dislikes_character_10","I have work aplenty ... even for hands such as yours."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_01","I have contracts available ... if you're under-employed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_02","I think I have just the contract for you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_03","I have a matter that could use your personal attention."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_04","This is excellent! I have a contract that will suit you to a tee!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_05","Excuse me! I could use your assistance with this contract!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_06","Don't forget to undertake a contract ... We must all do our part."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_07","Hello there! Would you care to commit to a contract?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_08","Aha! The very person I was looking for!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_09","Excellent, just excellent! Walk this way, and I'll put you to work."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_distance_likes_character_10","Yes, I thought I heard you before. Would you mind helping out with a contract?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_01","I have a bad feeling about this."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_02","Well, we make do as best we can."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_03","Prove me wrong. Return in glory."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_04","Well. I suppose it might work out."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_05","Do try not to get yourself killed. Or don't."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_06","Dear, dear, dear. I shudder for the future."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_07","Alas for the Imperium ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_08","Farewell. I'll see you again ... or not."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_09","Hail and farewell."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_10","Until our paths cross again. If they do."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_11","There goes another statistic."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_12","Goodbye."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_13","Try to acquit yourself nobly."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_14","I shall watch your career with interest."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_15","Emperor protect you ... You'll need him."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_16","Do remember to duck when they start shooting."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_17","Now get right in there when the shooting starts. No shillyshallying."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_18","I'll be interested to see how you get on."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_19","Don't let us down ... he said, ever the optimist."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_dislikes_character_20","Remember to hold your weapon the right way around. That will help."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_01","Emperor walk with you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_02","I wish you every success."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_03","Fortune find you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_04","I have a good feeling about this."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_05","You will perform splendidly, I'm sure."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_06","How soon they leave ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_07","Hail and farewell."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_08","Atoma owes you a debt."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_09","Do the Emperor proud. I know you will."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_10","For Terra and the Throne."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_11","Oh, I wish I could go with you ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_12","Our hopes go with you ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_13","Emperor preserve you, my friend."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_14","You are an inspiration."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_15","I am pleased to be your guide in this wicked world."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_16","Do come back."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_17","I will be here upon your return."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_18","Return in glory, my friend."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_19","Ah, you remind me of my youth."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_goodbye_likes_character_20","Nothing to say? Never mind, we'll drink together on your return."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_01","Purchase complete."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_02","Well ... if you're sure."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_03","That's an interesting choice. "
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_04","It's too good for you ... but everything is."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_05","Transaction completed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_06","It's yours. Enjoy your time with it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_07","That's what you went with? ... Very well."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_08","As you wish."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_09","Of course. I thought that would be the one."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_purchase_a_10","Very discerning, I'm sure."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_01","Hm. Let's see now ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_02","I'm sure I can accommodate you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_03","I wouldn't do this for just anyone, you know."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_04","Keep it between us."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_05","I'm sure I can trust your discretion."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_06","A bit challenging for your thin blood, is it?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_07","I shouldn't really be doing this, but ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_08","Not to your liking? Very well."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_09","Don't be so picky ... I'm not."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_10","Let me have a look for you ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_11","I'm sure I have something suitable ... even for you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_12","Ah yes, I can see why that would be a poor fit."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_13","This isn't strictly above board, of course ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_14","No. No. Let me just rearrange my plans to suit you ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_15","Why can't anyone ever just take what they're given? Answer me that!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_16","Your contribution to the Darius Melk foundation is appreciated."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_17","The Darius Melk foundation welcomes all contributions."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_18","I am nothing if not a charitable fellow. Always happy to help."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_19","Yes ... I suppose we could arrange something else."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_replacing_task_20","It will take just a moment ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_servitor_purchase_b_01","I've told you before: be quiet!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_servitor_purchase_b_02","I don't recall giving you leave to speak!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_servitor_purchase_b_03","Irritating machine isn't it?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_servitor_purchase_b_04","I really must have your vocator-systems disabled."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_servitor_purchase_b_05","Silence! I do the talking around here!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_01","Signed and sealed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_02","Don't let me down."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_03","I sign this pact in the Emperor's name."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_04","The contract is confirmed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_05","Confirmed. The rest is up to you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_06","Contract sealed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_07","Contract established."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_08","Contract sealed. Please move along."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_09","Contract ... confirmed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_10","Contract underway. Let's see what happens, shall we?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_11","Well. Go on then. Get it done."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_12","Why are you still lollygagging?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_13","Duty logged."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_14","Duty established. ID confirmed. Good."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_15","Do try not to mess it up."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_16","The contract is struck, the work begins."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_17","Signed ""Lord Darius Melk"" and ... just leave an ""X""."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_18","One trusts you can sign your own name?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_19","Just leave a squiggle. I'll find you ... if I have need."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__contract_vendor_setting_contract_20","There we go ... That didn't hurt, did it?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__eavesdropping_contract_vendor_01","Shut off your comms if you want to gossip."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__eavesdropping_contract_vendor_02","I heard that."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__eavesdropping_contract_vendor_03","I can hear everything you're saying."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__eavesdropping_contract_vendor_04","Nothing is a secret when you don't shut off your comms."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__eavesdropping_contract_vendor_05","I can hear you..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_01","That one's dead. "
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_02","Confirmed destroyed. Good."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_03","That looks pretty lifeless to me."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_04","Aha. That's a promising start."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_01","There's still one awaiting your inimitable attention."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_02","One more remains. Please kill it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_03","Auspex shows one left."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_04","You've still one more to terminate."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_01","More infestation sites identified."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_02","Further infestations logged."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_03","Yes. I believe you have more to destroy."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_04","This infestation is tenacious!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_01","[Sniff] So this is what passes for an operative these days?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_02","You are a deplorable sight. It would never have happened in my day."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_03","Do try to stand up straight."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_04","Honestly, you're in an Inquisitor's service now. Try to act like it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_05","I don't know where Rannick finds these ne'er do wells."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_06","Such a rabble. Discipline is ever more lax of late."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_07","[Sigh] Grendyl's standards have fallen far. The proof is all around us."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_08","With such defenders, I fear Atoma is doomed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_09","Ah, this takes me back. The aftermath of the Konnix Campaign, I think it was ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_10","Despicable. Not a pressed uniform among them ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_11","Will no one salute an old man? ... No ... I suppose not."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_12","The Mourningstar has seen better days ... but then haven't we all?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_13","Let me take a look at you ... Quickly now! ... Yes. How disappointing."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_14","Sad days for the Imperium, if this is all it can muster."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_15","Let me see now ... No ... I've lost my train of thought."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_16","Well don't just mill around! I've work that needs doing!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_17","No sense of priority, these young folk."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_18","I expect you to comport yourself well. I'm sure I shall be disappointed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_19","[Deep and Mournful Sigh]"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_idle_20","[Series of Disappointed Tuts]"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_01","If you must, I suppose."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_02","No, truly. This is the highlight of my day."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_03","Let me know if you need the longer words explaining."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_04","A little air, please. I have no wish to share your enviable aroma."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_05","Must you stand so close?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_06","I have a good feeling about what comes next. Truly."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_07","Ambition. Authority. Adaptability. You lack all three, I'll warrant."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_08","Really? This will be interesting."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_09","Are you certain this is a sensible course?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_10","Are you quite sure you're ready for this?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_11","Well ... if you think you're up to it, you're welcome to try."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_12","Oh ... It's you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_13","I am a lodestone for blockheads today."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_14","Oh, make it quick."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_15","Hurry up. I have things to do."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_16","Must you be so ... distracting?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_17","[Sigh] Proceed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_18","[Sigh] What now?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_19","Ah, a peerless adept of martial duty approaches ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_20","Yes. If you must."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_01","Rannick has authorised a mission suited to your talents."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_02","Excellent. I'm sure you're just what we're looking for."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_03","Make thorough examination before accepting."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_04","You may find something suitable."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_05","Take my advice: do not disappoint in your duty."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_06","How may I assist you?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_07","I stand ready. What do you need?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_08","These assignments are for accomplished operatives only."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_09","Delightful to see you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_10","We may proceed whenever you are ready."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_11","You do have a fine opinion of yourself, don't you?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_12","Very well, take a look."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_13","Who am I to stifle ambition?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_14","Oh, very well."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_15","Rannick believes you capable of great things. Either way, you'll settle a wager."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_16","It's refreshing to converse with one who knows their place."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_17","We are all servants of Inquisitor Grendyl."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_18","My authority comes direct from Inquisitor Grendyl. I'll be sure to speak of your successes."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_19","Good morrow."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_interact_likes_character_20","Aha! I was wondering when you'd stop by."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_01_b_01","Indeed not! The very idea is literally unthinkable. [Sotto] That said, I have my concerns."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_02_b_01","Never fear, Sergeant-Major. I shall be glad to report any scuttlebutt."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_03_b_01","Grateful for your support though I am, I'm quite capable of handling these ruffians."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_04_b_01","Is that so? Well, protocol is a duty gladly shared ... even with those who mock its importance."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_08_b_01","Really, woman ... Not over an open channel! ... I mean, thank you. I'll be along presently."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_09_a_01","Sergeant Major? We really should speak about these performance reviews for your operatives. They are not encouraging."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_10_b_01","Oh, most excellent. I am in your debt."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__hub_rumours_vox_10_d_01","Ah ... perhaps it will wait."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_all_players_required_a_01","You need to be together."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_all_players_required_a_02","Oh for Throne's sake ... Group up!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_all_players_required_a_03","I need you all together!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_all_players_required_a_04","Group up. I should have though that was obvious."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_almost_done_a_01","You're making progress ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_almost_done_a_02","Don't let up now ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_almost_done_a_03","Stay focused ... if you can."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_almost_done_a_04","So very nearly there ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_one_down_a_01","The first step is complete."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_one_down_a_02","One down."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_one_down_a_03","That's one."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_event_one_down_a_04","A commendable start."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_01","It seems functional ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_02","Signal is strong ... Data flow underway."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_03","That appears to be functional."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_04","Ah yes. That seems to be working."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_01","Your task is almost complete."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_02","Just a little longer ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_03","Almost done ... Try not to blunder now!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_04","Not long now. Stay competent just a little longer ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_01","Excellent! Interrogation completed!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_02","The interrogation has been successful."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_03","You actually completed the task. Surprising."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_04","The interrogation is over. A successful conclusion."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_01","Hangar Delta-175 is below you. Proceed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_02","Find a way down to Hangar Delta-175."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_03","You must descend to Hangar Delta-175."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_04","Hangar Delta-175 is below you. Find a way down."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_01","You are nearing the Excise Vault."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_02","You're almost to the Vault. Don't get sloppy."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_03","The Vault isn't far. Keep moving and stay alert."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_04","Just a little further to the Excise Vault."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_01","The cargo elevator's incorrectly aligned. You'll have to do something about that."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_02","The cargo elevator's no use to you like that. Look for the controls."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_03","You'll need to realign the cargo elevator to proceed. Perhaps you should get that underway?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_04","Of course the cargo elevator is in the wrong position. Rectify and proceed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_a_01","My Aurics would have had this done by now."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_a_02","Must you dawdle? I'm embarrassed by association."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_a_03","I'm sure this is taking longer than it needs to."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_a_04","They are a slovenly bunch, Zola. Someone should take them in hand."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_01","Aha! Now if it were me, I'd use explosives here."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_02","Ah, this takes me back to my old ""shock and awe"" days."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_03","Doesn't look terribly reinforced. A demo charge will clear it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_04","I recommend the use of explosives, both generally and specifically."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_01","Ah, they'll be deeper in if I know my heretics. Not that I know them in ""that"" sense, you understand."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_02","This reminds me of a nasty little skirmish back on Cymballa V. Oh, fond memories ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_03","Laggards. A real team would have them already."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_04","I really would consider moving faster, but don't mind me."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rivals_a_01","I must admit, some of these rejects - some of them, mark you - may have what it takes."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rivals_a_02","I confess that these rejects have handled themselves with some small skill."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rivals_a_03","I may have judged this particular batch of rejects too harshly. I suppose."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rivals_a_04","This could be going much worse. I confess I am somewhat surprised."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_01","My apologies, explicator. I tried explaining protocol to her, but for some reason it didn't work."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_02","You see, commodore? I knew you'd not be ... required."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_03","Don't waste time arguing protocol with this one, explicator. She's scarcely literate in such things."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_04","You're wasting your breath, explicator. She doesn't take hints."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_01","Yes, you did rather draw their attention. My Auric class operatives wouldn't have made this much hullabaloo."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_02","So anarchic! I said from the very first that this mission should have been assigned to my Auric Operatives."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_03","Auric class operatives would have handled this more cleanly."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_04","This should have been an Auric Operative mission. A professional mission."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_01","I am merely offering you the benefit of my experience ... whereas she is almost certainly aiming to make some kind of sordid profit."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_02","I merely offer the comfort of a guiding hand. It's her who doubtless has an ulterior motive."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_03","She's almost certainly working some dubious angle. I merely wish to be of service."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_04","If past experience is any guide, she's almost certainly involved in a criminal endeavour. I am simply here to observe."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_01","A ridiculous assertion!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_02","Hah! I think not!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_03","You ... You ... You vexacious harlot!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_04","Lies! Not that it's any surprise!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_stims_c_01","Honestly, is that really a priority?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_stims_c_02","You really are shameless ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_stims_c_03","That I would live to see Inquisition business so subverted ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_stims_c_04","Madam! Do not sully duty with ... grubby avarice!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_a_01","That's it! Don't give those blackguards time to breathe!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_a_02","Oh, good show. I do like to see heretics getting trounced."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_a_03","This really is a formidable body count. Well done!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_a_04","Yes! Teach them the error of their heretic ways!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_01","Are you really the best Grendyl can manage these days? A sorry show."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_02","You really are a rabble, aren't you? Never mind, we do what we can."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_03","Stand up straight, would you? There are standards even in this debased company."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_04","Dear oh dear. I hope you've got better to give than what I've seen so far."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_one_b_01","I will have you know I'm as alert as can be. It's called discipline. I wouldn't expect you to understand."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_one_b_02","Ah, so it's jibes about my age, is it? How very original. You are truly a shining wit."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_one_b_03","Oh, do be quiet. Some of us are trying to monitor the state of the mission. You know, like professionals?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_one_b_04","In my day we had a lot more respect for our elders. And when we didn't, we at least put effort into our insults."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_three_b_01","Oh yes, that's a worthwhile accomplishment. More precious than diamantine."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_three_b_02","Respect cannot be worth more than the vessel carrying it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_three_b_03","Such a small favour to earn. Hardly seems worth the bother."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_three_b_04","A prize beyond value, I'm sure. [Stifled Laugh] I'm sorry, couldn't keep a straight face."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_01","Strike Team? Do please remember that this ... individual ... has no authority, whereas I speak with Grendyl's voice."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_02","Now you listen to me, rejects. Whatever Hallowette claims, she has no authority over you."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_03","Strike Team? Remember that Hallowette is not a fit person to oversee these missions. Listen only to me."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_04","Strike Team, you would do well to remember that Hallowette is not part of the warband, and thus has no authority in these matters."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_01","Ah ... It seems some outside force is preventing the blast gate from opening."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_02","Unfortunately, the heretics seem to have jammed the blast gate. Attend to the matter!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_03","The blast gate isn't responding. It must be jammed somewhere nearby."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_04","Ah ... I'll wager there's another of those daemonic scoundrels keeping the blast gate closed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_demolisher_melk_01_a_01","That tank looks abandoned! Never would have happened in my day."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_demolisher_melk_02_a_01","I don't suppose anyone has time to note the serial number of that Leman Russ? Everything must be accounted for."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_demolisher_melk_03_a_01","Lamentable to see valuable equipment abandoned in the field."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_b_01","I thought I could perhaps overlook this indiscretion--"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_b_02","I'm not without sympathy for what you're doing--"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_b_03","Rules are rules, but a wise man knows--"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_b_04","We don't need to be at loggerheads, especially with--"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_d_01","Shall we say a 20/80 split in your favour? Call it a consulting fee."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_d_02","Nothing you'll miss. I have ... commitments."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_d_03","I'm not a greedy man. I'll settle for 20% of the proceeds."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_d_04","20%, straight off the top. And strictly between ourselves."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_01","Aha. Here we are. Please don't leave the pay-off behind ... A pleasure working with you, Lady Alice."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_02","Time to take your leave ... Don't forget what you came for. Until next time, Lady Alice."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_03","That's it. Extraction isn't far ... I'll let you know where to deposit my cut, Lady Alice."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_04","Now all you need do is leave with the prize ... Charmed to have worked with you, Lady Alice."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_01","Auspex is reading daemonic matter nearby. You'd better destroy it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_02","My auspex shows a daemonic infestation. Sort it out."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_03","You'll not be going anywhere until you attend to that infestation."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_04","I fear you'll have to cleanse the infestation to proceed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_01","I'd imagine that has cleared the blockage."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_02","You should now be clear to proceed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_03","I believe you're clear to continue."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_04","That should be sufficient. You may proceed."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_02","Barring other surprises, I think that should do it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_04","Are you waiting for applause? You'll be waiting a long time."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_01","Be on your guard. Something may yet go wrong."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_02","Well, it seems like this has been a productive jaunt ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_03","This could certainly have gone far worse."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_04","Not long now. Do try to maintain the aura of competency you've acquired."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_b_01","I assume you do have a plan for getting it - and them - back out?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_b_02","And now it - and they - are trapped by heretics. Flawless planning."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_b_03","They still have to get out, and by the look of these auspex readings--"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_b_04","And how, pray, do they get out? Fly?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_01","That's the way! Well done. Find the gate release and get moving."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_02","Splendid. Now all you need do is find the gate release."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_03","What is this strange, warming feeling? Is it pride? How odd. Now all you need is the gate release."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_04","Once you trigger the gate release, you can proceed. Was that too subtle a hint?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_b_01","Easily resolved. They can use power cores to trip the lockout capacitors, and data-interrogators to move the trains themselves."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_b_02","Hardly a complication. Power cores can trip the lockout. Data-interrogators can move the trains."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_b_03","Oh please ... Just trip the lockout with power cores. Data-interrogators can handle the trains themselves."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_b_04","Such a fuss over nothing. Trip the lockout capacitors with power cores, then employ data-interrogators to move the trains. It's really very simple."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_01","Ah yes, that's the lockout cleared. You may now proceed with the next stage."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_02","Nicely done. Your data-interrogators can do the rest."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_03","I'm actually impressed. It's a very strange feeling. Now for the trains."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_04","Data-interrogators out. Let's get this done."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_01","It would seem the power's out. Shoddy maintenance."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_02","I'm sure Tertium's logisticiers would blame the war for the power being out. It might even be true."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_03","Don't lollygag. There's no power to these tracks."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_04","The tracks aren't powered. No need to be hesistant."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_01","You are greatly outnumbered. Withdrawal would seem prudent."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_02","Remaining in the face of such odds is tantamount to suicide. Withdraw!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_03","The heretics are without number. Lingering here is folly!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_04","Why aren't you running? You should be running!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_maze_a_01","Ah. So sad to see the Imperium's structures in such decay."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_maze_a_04","You are currently 7% behind schedule. [Sigh] Young people these days ..."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_01","This looks like a suitable crossing point."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_02","Ah. A portage point."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_03","You can cross here, if you mind your step."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_04","This should serve as as crossing point."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_c_01","I have elected to give you all the benefit of my experience."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_c_02","You should welcome a firm and guiding hand."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_c_03","I merely seek to advise."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_c_04","Perhaps I was ... too hasty earlier."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_siding_a_01","You should be approaching the maintenance siding."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_siding_a_02","The maintenance siding shouldn't be far."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_siding_a_03","You are now approaching the maintenance siding."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_siding_a_04","Aha. If I'm reading this right, the maintenance siding is close by."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_b_01","What is this meaning of this? Are you interfering with Inquisitorial business?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_b_02","Stop at once! By the authority invested in me, I forbid this!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_b_03","I cannot believe it! Treachery aboard Grendyl's chosen vessel!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_b_04","Do you have authorisation for this mission, Hallowette? I doubt it."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_d_01","Grendyl shall hear of this!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_d_02","I shall inform Grendyl of this ... transgression!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_d_03","You can defy me, but what about Grendyl?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_start_d_04","Your defiance will melt once Grendyl learns of this!"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_01","That's right. Straight on through the depot. You can manage that, I'm sure."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_02","The Transit Hub lies a short distance beyond the depot. You'll see."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_03","Please try not to get lost in the depot. My blood pressure isn't what it was."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_04","This is the depot. You need the Transit Hub ... so you'd better keep moving."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_01","Do you see the patina on the rails? Substandard materials. Peculation! Shameful."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_02","Do you see the state of these rails? I'm amazed anything still runs."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_03","I confess, I never thought you'd make it this far."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_04","Are you slowing down? This really isn't the time to take it easy."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_01","Don't get any strange ideas about freedom. You're still Grendyl's vassals."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_02","I've never cared much for the outdoors. They're so ... untidy and undisciplined."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_03","Daylight is all very well, but it doesn't last, does it?"
"loc_contract_vendor_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_04","Yes, I'm sure you're having a lovely time, but do try to remember the mission."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__npc_first_interaction_a_01","You may address me as Sire Melk."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__npc_first_interaction_b_01","I have been long in Inquisitor Grendyl's service, and I can assure you that he relies upon my exquisite judge of character."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__npc_first_interaction_c_01","If you visit me from time to time, I will gladly furnish you with a mission contract commensurate with your ability."
"loc_contract_vendor_a__npc_first_interaction_d_01","Complete these tasks and receive a modest stipend of marks. Is that clear?"

"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_closer_c_03","The fusion grid writhes in confusion, its data a-jumbled and subverted. Its torment is a beacon."
"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_a_01","Warning gave I. You heeded not. Madness infected our vox receptors."

"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_01","Harvested data suggests a sole genesis chamber for the stimms. It must be destroyed."
"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_02","Data-haul implies a genesis chamber is close. Reduce it to unfunction, and with haste."
"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_03","A genesis chamber? Here? And pressed to ill-purpose. Grant it release, must you."
"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_production_habs_b_01","A concern to be borne by others, technoarchaeologist."
"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_production_habs_b_02","The fate of the unenlightened is not our immediate concern."

"loc_enginseer_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_c_01","Someone must bear witness to these blasphemies."

"loc_explicator_a__cs_pot05_01","There’s a lot of work to be done. A lot. Tertium’s big and we’re just scratching the surface."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_pot05_02","I suggest you use your down-time to pick up the slack."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_pot05_03","We’ll be posting up contracts. Scouting, sweeps, surveillance, that sort of thing."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_pot05_04","I know. More work to do, but people who put in the time can earn a few markers for their effort."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_pot05_05","So show a little initiative, and it’ll be noted on your review."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_pot05_06","The seniors have their eye on you."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_pot05_07","Plus, it pays extra."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_five_01_01","Masozi, you done anytime soon?"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_five_03_01","Well? You coming or not?"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_five_04_01","You helped me. Maybe I can help you. No promises. You’ll probably wind up dead."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_five_06_01","Very poetic..."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_five_07_01","Oh... just don’t tell anyone I let an escaped prisoner save my life."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_five_08_01","Or you’ll be more than dead."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_four_01_01","Masozi, get us the Hel out of here!"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_four_03_01","Great..."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_seven_01_01","Ah... So the next step before we can--"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_seven_03_01","This one could be useful. Claims to be a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_seven_05_01","This is--"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_seven_08_01","Alright, get to the Psykhanium!"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_three_01_01","Great..."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_three_02_01","You come for blood too, criminal?"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_three_03_01","You said you were a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_three_05_01","Then prove it!"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_01_01","I’ll check for myself, if you don’t mind."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_04_01","That one certainly is."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_05_01","Keep him intact. No “accidents”."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_06_01","My master wants to interrogate him as soon as we reach the hive."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_08_01","This one, however..."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_10_01","Hmm..."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_12_01","What do you say, criminal. Shall I put you out of your misery?"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_14_01","Be quiet."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_15_01","Well? Nothing to say?"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_18_01","Shame you’ll never get to prove that."
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_20_01","Counter fire! Now!"
"loc_explicator_a__cs_prologue_two_25_01","This is Explicator Zola! Support request, urgent!"
"loc_explicator_a__eavesdropping_explicator_01","I'm not sure you meant me to hear that, but I did."
"loc_explicator_a__eavesdropping_explicator_02","I heard that, you know."
"loc_explicator_a__eavesdropping_explicator_03","Hope that wasn't meant to be a secret."
"loc_explicator_a__eavesdropping_explicator_04","I can hear you..."
"loc_explicator_a__eavesdropping_explicator_05","Still here."
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_01","One dead. It's a start."
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_02","Killing one isn't enough. Find the others!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_03","You need to kill all of them to make this work!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_04","Look for the rest! Killing one solves nothing!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_01","Last daemonic growth! Destroy it!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_02","You've got one more to destroy!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_03","Reading ... Yes! One last daemonic growth!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_04","I want that last daemonic growth gone!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_01","There are more daemonic growths!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_02","Throne! You've got more daemonic growths!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_03","More growths!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_04","The daemon's fighting back! More growths!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_disable_the_skyfire_01","Get those skyfire defences offline! We've only got one shot at this."
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_disable_the_skyfire_02","We need those skyfire defences offline! Make it a priority!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_disable_the_skyfire_03","We can't land support craft with this skyfire defences operational!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_disable_the_skyfire_04","I need you to disable the skyfire defences. Let's give Masozi some room."
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_01","Good work. Now keep your heads down until help arrives."
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_02","That'll do. Help's inbound. Try to be alive when it gets there."
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_03","That's good work. I've ordered you support team into postion. They're inbound."
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_04","Support team's coming. Keep your heads down - don't give the heretics any satisfaction, do you hear me?"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_01","All right! Get the Blast Gate open, and you're about done!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_02","Now I need you to get the Blast Gate open!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_03","Final step: Restore power to the Blast Gate!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_04","All right! Just get that Blast Gate open! You'll need to restore the power!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_01","All right! Now set up a landing beacon to guide in your support team."
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_02","You're making progress, but your support team needs a landing beacon."
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_03","A good start. Now activate a landing beacon for your support team!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_04","A clean start. Next up, your support team needs a landing beacon."
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_kill_the_target_01","That's the Sanction Redactus Target! Go! Go! Go!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_kill_the_target_02","Sanction Redactus Target on site! End him!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_kill_the_target_03","Sanction Redactus Target confirmed and locked in! I want him dead!"
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_kill_the_target_04","That's the Sanction Redactus Target! What are you waiting for?"
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_target_destroyed_b_01","This goes some way to clearing your ledger."
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_target_destroyed_b_02","Rannick will be impressed. I'll be sure to tell him what you did here."
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_target_destroyed_b_03","Rannick has already been informed. He almost smiled."
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_target_destroyed_b_04","Masozi? Time to bring them home."
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_target_heavy_damage_b_01","No celebrations until it's ended."
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_target_heavy_damage_b_02","You're not done yet."
"loc_explicator_a__event_kill_target_heavy_damage_b_03","Don't get over confident."

"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_all_targets_scanned_a_01","I'm not reading any more data in this area. Return to to the servo-skull."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_all_targets_scanned_a_02","Get that data to the servo-skull before the heretics regroup."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_all_targets_scanned_a_03","I think we're done here. Upload to the servo-skull and move out."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_all_targets_scanned_a_04","Back to the servo-skull. Upload your data and proceed with the next phase."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_first_a_01","This is the scan location. Auspexes out, and let's get this done."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_first_a_02","Scan location reached. Time to put those auspexes to work."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_first_a_03","You're at the scan location. Let's get what we came for."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_first_a_04","Auspexes out. We need that data. Don't let me down."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_01","We're going to need more data. You know what comes next."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_02","We're not done. You'll need to make a secondary data sweep."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_03","This isn't over. We need more data. Get to it."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_04","A new scan location should mean fresh data. Let's find out."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_more_data_01","The servo-skull's seeking a new data-source. Stay with."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_more_data_02","Stay close to the servo-skull - it's searching for a secondary scan zone."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_more_data_03","Additional scan zone identified. Stay close to the servo-skull."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_more_data_04","We're going to need more. Stay with the servo-skull and repeat."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_skull_waiting_01","The servo-skull is waiting."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_skull_waiting_02","Don't keep the servo-skull waiting."
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_skull_waiting_03","Why aren't you with the servo-skull?"
"loc_explicator_a__event_scan_skull_waiting_04","The servo-skull is in one location. You're in another. Why is that?"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_01","The war is waiting for you."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_02","Atoma needs you."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_03","Report to the Mission Terminal. You have work to do."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_04","You have work to do. Don't let me down."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_05","Tertium needs fighters. Not malingerers."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_06","We will not permit Tertium's fall!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_07","Operatives to your valkyries. There's always more to do."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_08","Trust to the Emperor! He will bring victory."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_09","Prove yourselves where it most counts: in battle!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_10","There can be no victory if we're not prepared to fight!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_11","The heretics will not take Atoma! Not while we draw breath!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_12","Stand firm, operatives! We are the fire that will cleanse Atoma!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_13","Defending this world is our holy duty. We will not fail!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_14","The Emperor expects we do our duty. He will not tolerate failure!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_15","The heretics will never win so long as we still fight!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_16","This world belongs to the Emperor, not to the heretics!"
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_17","Grendyl commands. We obey."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_18","Grendyl is watching us. Remember that."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_19","Grendyl calls you to higher purpose. Embrace it."
"loc_explicator_a__explicator_distance_20","This war must be won. This war will be won."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_01","The war against the heretic never ends. It only changes form."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_02","If you want to earn redemption, you'd better get to work."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_03","Serve with distinction, and past sins may be forgiven."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_04","Rannick isn't sure about you. Prove him wrong."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_05","Existence is service. Service is salvation."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_06","Don't try to get on my good side. Just do your job."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_07","We're here to do the jobs others can't handle."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_08","Keep to the cause. We're making a difference."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_09","The Emperor smiles on those who do his work."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_10","We're Atoma's best hope. Never forget that."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_11","We need good soldiers around here. I'm hoping that's you."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_12","The war goes on. It never ends. It only changes form."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_13","Rannick speaks for the Inquisitor. I speak for Rannick. You have no voice."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_14","Trust the Emperor alone, and in all things."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_15","Getting new reports from Atoma. It doesn't look good."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_eighteen_a_01","Lady Alice ... You had any luck sourcing those items I requested?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_fifteen_a_01","Commodore, we're a little short-handed down in HL-17-36. You couldn't spare a few bodies?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_forty_b_01","I was busy, all right? Data-work can wait."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_fourteen_a_01","Commodore, I'd like to thank you for providing additional training for our rejects."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_nineteen_b_01","Understood. I'll stop by once this next mission's away."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_seventeen_a_01","Commodore? I've a few special issue items I need sourcing."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_sixteen_a_01","Commodore ... Lady Alice ... I need you to stop aggravating Morrow. He's bad enough at the best of times."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtyeight_a_01","Hadron, things would go smoother if you'd stop quarrelling with Masozi."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtynine_b_01","[Sigh] Understood. I'll make time as soon as I can."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtythree_a_01","Hadron, how goes the refit of the Auric strike teams' wargear?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twenty-three_b_01","She agreed to placing the Mourningstar at Grendyl's disposal, didn't she?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twenty_b_01","Tell me about it. But unless you can bend Rannick's ear, nothing's going to change."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentyone_b_01","Been busy, that's all. This war won't win itself."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentytwo_b_01","I appreciate it. I'll swing by later to discuss it."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_eight_b_01","Yeah? Like you're not already listening in to every vox channel on the Mourningstar already."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_eleven_a_01","Morrow? We need you in the wardroom."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_fifteen_a_01","Masozi? I'm still waiting for your last after action report."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_fourteen_a_01","Masozi? Kindly remind the deck crews that possession of Atoman contrabrand is punishable by the severest means."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_nine_a_01","Morrow? We can't keep on this way. We risk losing what gains we've made."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_one_b_01","She's not here, sergeant. Personal mission. Rannick okayed it."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_sixteen_b_01","Our old friends the Sky Reavers? I'll let Rannick know."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_ten_b_01","Interrogator Rannick says the matter is in hand. Trust to your superiors, Morrow."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_thirteen_a_01","How goes training the Mourningstar's fighter pilots?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_thirteen_b_01","Keep me informed of their progress. We need them ready."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_idle_conversation_twelve_a_01","Morrow? Shipmistress Brahms claims several of your charges are straying into unauthorised areas."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_01","Ready to get back out there?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_02","Let's put those heretics in their place."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_03","Tertium's counting on you."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_04","I'm glad you're here."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_05","We've work to do."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_06","Let's get to business."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_07","It's time. Are you ready?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_08","You're getting better at this."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_11","We cannot afford to fail."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_12","Atoma needs us."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_13","The Emperor calls you. How do you answer?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_14","The Emperor Protects."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_15","Throne protect us."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_16","Throne guide us."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_17","We are the hand of judgement."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_18","Are you ready to fight?"
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_19","What comes next is up to us."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_interact_likes_character_a_20","The heretics must not prosper."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_c_01","Recon teams, Wyrmwood agents and loyal citizens risk their lives delivering vital intelligence."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_d_01","It's dangerous work. "
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_e_01","But the Imperium is built on the blood of martyrs."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_f_01","Sire Darius Melk is responsible for collating and analysing these reports, identifying priority targets, supply lines and transitory weaknesses in the traitor war machine. "
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_g_01","The benefit of the tasks he asks you to undertake may not immediately be clear. "
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_h_01","But like Moebian steel, triumph is forged of many elements."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_i_01","Strength, certainly. "
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_j_01","Courage, of course.  "
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_k_01","Faith above all."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_contracts_l_01","But to have any hope of victory, we must also be clever."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_gun_shop_a_01","An operative lives or dies by their weaponry, but the supply situation's dire, so we use whatever we can get our hands on."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_gun_shop_b_01","I've cleared you for access to the Armoury Exchange. From there, you can requisition reconditioned weaponry recovered from the field. "
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_gun_shop_c_01","Be sure that you're always carrying the best that's available."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_gun_shop_d_01","Looking for a specific weapon type? Put in a request with Quartermaster Brunt ... or one of his servitors."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_intro_gun_shop_e_01","What you get won't be top of the line, but it should cater to your tastes."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_mid_a_01","You've probably heard by now that Rinda Karnak has returned from the dead. Watch your backs down there."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_mid_a_02","You'll have heard whispers that Rinda Karnak is not only alive, but attacking strike teams. Don't get sloppy."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_mid_a_03","Rinda Karnak's not as dead as we thought. She'll be gunning for you, mark my words."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_mid_a_04","We've had multiple confirmed sightings of Rinda Karnak. She's already killed hundreds of operatives. Don't be next."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_mid_a_05","It turns out that Rinda Karnak isn't dead. That's all we need. She'll be coming for you, so stay awake down there."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_start_a_01","We're getting reports of an unnatural darkness in certain regions of the hive. Deployments will continue as normal, but be prepared."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_start_a_02","Wyrmwood agents report an inexplicable darkness rising in the hive. Prepare for battle accordingly."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_start_a_03","Certain sectors of Tertium are drowning in darkness. Rannick insists this is the work of the cult. He may be right."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_start_a_04","Several hive sectors are drowning in darkness. It's a bad omen for St Caladoc's day. You can bet this is the work of the cult."
"loc_explicator_a__hub_seasonal_kalyx_start_a_05","St Caladoc's day is time for light and hope, but much of the hive lies in darkness. It's unnatural. Keep your eyes open and your weapons ready."
"loc_explicator_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_01","Looks like the heretics have been making sport around here, using Pox Hounds to flush enemies out of cover."
"loc_explicator_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_02","I'm hearing there have been plenty of Pox Hound sightings down there. Watch each others' backs."
"loc_explicator_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_03","The heretics have been hunting with Pox Hounds. Be careful or you'll end up part of the chase."
"loc_explicator_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_04","Heretics make sport by loosing Pox Hounds into the streets. Listen for the howls, and be ready."
"loc_explicator_a__info_all_players_required_01","Everyone pay attention and group up as soon as you can!"
"loc_explicator_a__info_all_players_required_02","You need to group up."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_03","Time to deploy your servo-skull and find that data!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_04","You don't have time for a manual search. Fortunately, your servo-skull can narrow the field."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_01","Getting further means overriding the substack gates. An alarm will sound. Try to keep calm."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_02","You'll proceed through the substacks. Open the gates, but be ready for an alarm."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_03","The substack gates will be sealed. You can open them easily enough, but it will set off an alarm."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_04","Proceed through the substack gates. You'll want to be fast. Opening them up with set off an alarm."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_b_01","Thank you for the feedback. I'll be sure to take note."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_02_a_03","They'll keep coming, so you need to keep moving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_02_a_04","This is a bad place to get cornered."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_01","Your best approach is straight through that brewery."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_02","You're on track. Make your way through the brewery."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_03","Keep moving. The amphitheatre's on the far side of the brewery. "
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_04","The brewery's your best short cut. Let's hope there's no ambush waiting."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_a_01","For this mission you're heading into HL-70-04. It's a recreation district, better known as the Carnival."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_b_01","It never was a place to be proud of, but the Moebians have made it worse."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_b_02","It always was full to the brim with scum, and now it's a Moebian stronghold."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_b_03","It was never pretty, but now it's a Moebian stronghold it's worse than ever."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_b_04","The Moebians have it completely locked down. Make no mistake: this is enemy ground."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_c_01","The Moebians are running stimms out of the district, the handover being in the old amphitheatre. This is a possible contagion vector for the Blight, so we want samples to analyse."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_c_02","The Moebian stimm trade seems to be a contagion vector for the Blight, so you're to raid the amphitheatre and get us some samples for study."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_c_03","Black market trade is rife, but we're interested in the stimms passing through the amphitheatre. They could be a Blight source, but we need a sample to be sure."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_briefing_c_04","An unhealthy trade in stimms comes through the local amphitheatre, and there's a strong possibility they're being used to spread the Blight. I want answers."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_complete_a_04","That's it! We've got the cyphers. Get out of there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_ending_b_01","That's it. Another mission in the bag. I'll see Grendyl hears of this."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_ending_b_02","Impressive work. Let's hope those stimms can tell us something."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_ending_b_03","Stimms secured and the heretics mad as hel. Good work."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_ending_b_04","That's everything as good as squared away. You've done well."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_01","You're going to need a breaching charge."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_02","Looks like you'll be blasting your way in."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_03","You'll need to blast your own door."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_04","No obvious means of entry. Make your own."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_01","Right, the Moebians are using the refectory as a barracks. Get inside, and you should be able to shake loose the cyphers we need."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_02","The refectory's serving as a Moebian barracks. It shouldn't take much to find today's cypher codes ... once you're inside, anyway."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_03","You'll need to breach the refectory and find today's cypher codes. "
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_04","There's a makeshift barracks up ahead. Get inside and find the cypher access codes for the amphitheatre."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_01","This place hasn't changed much since I was running with the Water Cartel. It was a dive then, it's a dive now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_02","Some places are so tarnished that even heretics can't drag them down-market."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_03","I used to dream of living here. Thank the Emperor for broadened horizons."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_04","This used to seem like paradise. You can be so wrong when you're young."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_refectory_a_01","Not exactly subtle, but you're through. Now to find those cyphers."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_refectory_a_02","Good work. Breach and clear. Get me those cyphers."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_refectory_a_03","Get inside, and make it fast. We don't want them wiping the cyphers."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_refectory_a_04","So far, so good. Now find those cyphers!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_01","That's it. It's time to signal the extraction team. "
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_02","Keep at it. You need to signal for extraction."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_03","Extraction team's waiting for your signal."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_04","If you want out of there, you'll need to get the extraction team's attention."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_b_01","What do you want, commodore?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_b_02","What is the meaning of this, commodore?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_b_03","Commodore, I don't know what you're doing here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_b_04","Commodore Hallowette. I wasn't aware you'd be joining us."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_d_01","This is an Ordo Hereticus mission. It's no concern of yours."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_d_02","I have Grendyl's full authority. I don't need you here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_d_03","Respectfully, I don't need you here. I don't want you here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_f_01","You too, Melk? [Frustrated noise] Just stay out of my way, both of you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_f_02","And the day just gets better ... Stay out of this, both of you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_f_03","Is anyone else listening in? ... No. Good. I have a mission to run."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_f_04","Lord Melk? What an absolute ... pleasure this is. Now kindly let me run my mission."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_01","No time to be fancy - blast a way in!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_02","Second breach. Get to it!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_03","Path's blocked. You know what to do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_04","Get that blockage cleared!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_a_01","You could lose an army in these streets. Lucky for you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_a_02","Keep moving, they'll be on your heels."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_a_03","I don't think the heretics are going to let you go easily."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_a_04","Stay sharp, you're bound to have pursuers."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_a_01","All right you two. You want to tell me what you're doing meddling in my operation?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_a_02","I think it's past time you two explained why you're even here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_a_03"," I want to know why you're both here. Now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_a_04","Right you two: explain why you're here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_stims_a_01","Those are the stimms. Good work."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_stims_a_02","Stimms are confirmed on site. Proceed with the plan."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_stims_a_03","The stimms are here. Let's recover whatever we can."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_stims_a_04","Target confirmed. Good work. Let's get this wrapped up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_c_01","I suppose that's as close to ""friendly"" as I can expect."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_c_02","Well ... at least those two have stopped fighting."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_c_03","They've found common ground. I'm so pleased."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_c_04","I don't know which one's worse."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_01","There's a supply train down in Metalfab 36. Rannick wants us to go get it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_02","Intel's reporting a supply train down in Metalfab 36. Ours for the taking."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_03","Rannick's got a new job for you: secure a supply train in Metalfab 36."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_04","Here's the mission: you're inbound to Metalfab 36 to 'liberate' a supply train."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_01","You'll need to get down to the Consignment Yard, secure it, and hold position until reinforcements arrive."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_02","You'll find it at Consignment Yard Sigma-57. Secure the area and await reinforcements."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_03","There's a second team ready to handle the actual extraction. You just need to secure the Consignment Yard."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_04","Another team will deal with the extraction. You're the advance team securing the Consignment Yard."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_01","The heretics want the train for themselves, so expect heavy resistance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_02","I don't need to tell you how badly we need those supplies. Don't screw this up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_03","We need these supplies. So Emperor walk with you, and don't fail me."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_04","I've seen the supply situation up here. It's not good. Help me turn that around."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_01","Cleanse the Consignment Yard of heretics, and signal the support team."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_02","Right! Get this place secured. Your support team will handle the rest."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_03","Move to secure the Consignment Yard. We'll get your support team in the air."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_04","Here already? Rannick will be impressed - not that you'd be able to tell. Get this place secured."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_01","You're in the home stretch. Get out to the Consignment Yard right away!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_02","The Consignment's Yard's close. Don't get sloppy."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_03","You're almost to the Consignment Yard. Just a little further."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_04","The Consignment Yard's beyond that door. Look for a release."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_01","Head down to the Production Nexus. Your data-interrogators can get you to the Consignment Yard from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_02","If you can reach the Production Nexus, you can cut across to the Consignment Yard from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_03","Get to the Production Nexus, then cut across Coolant Control to reach the Consignment Yard."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_04","You'll need your data-interrogators for this - access between the Production Nexus and Coolant Control is currently sealed."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_01","All right. You can get to Coolant Control now. The Consignment Yard's in reach."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_02","Obstacle cleared. Move out to Coolant Control."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_03","All right. Move on to the Consignment Yard via Coolant Control."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_04","Coolant Control's now accessible. You can reach the Consignment Yard from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_01","You'll need your data-interrogators to get that door open."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_02","Get your data-interrogators in place and you can get that door open."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_03","Your data-interrogators can override the security systems."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_04","You can't reach Coolant Control until you get that door open. Deploy your data-interrogators."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_production_line_01","All right. You're above the Production Nexus. Find a way down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_production_line_02","The Production Nexus is somewhere below you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_production_line_03","You need to find a way down to the Production Nexus."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_production_line_04","You're almost to the Production Nexus. In fact, it's below you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_01","Support team's in place, you can stand down. And ... good work."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_02","The support team can take it from here. I'll make sure Rannick knows what you did today."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_03","The support team's taking up position. Time for a well-earned rest, I'd say."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_04","You did good. Let the support team handle it from here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_01","Would you like me to transfer you to the meatgrinder battalions? Say the word."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_02","I can always reassign you to their ranks, if you'd rather."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_03","Reassignment would be the touch of a dataslate. You need only ask."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_04","You want to be reassigned? Trust me, you're better off with me."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_01","Get through the Worker's Cloister as fast as you can."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_02","The Worker's Cloister should lead you to the Production Nexus."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_03","The Production Nexus is just beyond the Worker's Cloister."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_04","That's right! Through the Worker's Cloister. Don't let the heretics slow you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_bridge_01","This bridge would have been thick with supplicants, back in the day, begging for the Ragged King's favour."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_bridge_02","The cartel's Ragged King used to bring traitors out here and throw them over the side."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_bridge_03","They used to call this the Bridge of Fools. Guess what used to go over the side?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_bridge_04","You're at the mouth of the lair now. Just a little further."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_one_01","Right. You up for a trip into the Torrent? We need to upload bad intel to the cogitator array."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_one_05","The Heretics are too reliant on the old Water Cartel cogitator array. We're going to exploit that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_one_06","There's a vast cogitator array hidden in the Torrent. The Heretics use it for gathering intel. So let's exploit that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_01","Soon as you're inside, feed the data package into the array. They'll never know what you've done until it's too late."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_02","Once you reach the array, get the data uploaded. But watch yourselves - there'll be heavy resistance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_03","Uploading the data should be simple enough. Keep your heads, and you'll do fine."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_04","There'll be secondary defences in the array itself, but nothing you can't handle. Make the Emperor proud."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_01","First of all, you'll need to get in. That means recovering the cypher-idents."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_02","Security's tighter than ever, but if you can get your hands on the cypher-idents that won't be a problem."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_04","You'll need cypher-idents, but your servo skull can track those down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_05","Security's no joke, but some of the ex-Cartel - now Moebian lackey - gunhands will have today's cypher-idents."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_01","Welcome to Ragtown - the crown jewel of the Torrent … such as it is."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_02","Try not to linger in Ragtown. It's dangerous at the best of times."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_03","Ragtown, eh? Believe me when I say it's no worse off for the heretics taking over."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_04","Ragtown's where the heretics really got their claws into the Water Cartel. It all went downhill from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_01","Can't upload while the security stacks are running."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_02","Get those security stacks bypassed. Quickly!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_03","Those security stacks will block the data upload."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_04","You'll have to disable those security stacks."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_01","The cypher-ident changes daily - or it used to - so let's make the most of this."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_02","That's it, you've got it! Clearing your crypt-key for elevator access."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_03","Cypher-ident reconstruction looks … yes. Yes! That's it. Head for the elevator."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_04","Reconstructing cypher-ident … Yes … Yes … Checks out. Let's get this done."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_two_02","They got what they deserved. It's just a shame it took a full-fledged uprising for it to happen."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_two_03","Don't waste your time thinking about the cartel. Atoma's a better place for their fall."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_two_04","If the cartel comes crawling out of the Sump again, I'll have another little task for you. Depend upon it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_01","The cartel was always too interested in wealth and power. They paid for their greed."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_02","The criminal becomes the heretical all too easily. It has happened before."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_03","The cartel was complacent. They looked the wrong way too often, and they paid."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_04","Eternal vigilance is beyond scum like the cartel. It must not be beyond us."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_01","My past is my own concern, operative. Don't mistake us for friends."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_02","Mine was a winding path - one that led through darker places than this."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_03","When I had nothing, Grendyl raised me up. Gave me purpose. Your fate too, if you are fortunate. Nothing else matters."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_04","I don't care to discuss that. You need only to understand that I speak with Grendyl's authority."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_01","Ever since the heretics absorbed the Cartel, there have been turf fights. Check the bodies for cypher-idents."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_02","The heretics took over the Water Cartel, but it's been messy. Check the corpses in the bazaar for cypher-idents."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_03","You want to head straight for the bazaar. Don't dawdle."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_04","The bazaar's close by. That's where you'll find the cypher-idents we need."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_01","If you can head to the bazaar, you should be able to scan for cypher idents."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_02","There should be cypher idents in the bazaar. Head that way and scan for them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_03","Since you've proved you can be effective, perhaps you can head to the bazaar and scan for idents."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_04","We need cypher idents. You can usually find those in the bazaar. Get going!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_01","One of these scum will have what we're looking for."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_02","Search the bodies. We need that cypher-ident."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_03","Get searching. You know what we're here for."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_04","Time to begin your search. Be as rough as you like - they can't feel it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_01","That fine settlement you're leaving behind? That's the Sump. Up ahead we've got Ragtown."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_02","Well you made it out of the Sump, which is more than most ever do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_03","Friend of mine got thrown into the Sump for thieving. He never made it back out. People don't."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_04","Not far to Ragtown now. It's not exactly classier than where you've been, but it's better."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_pillar_01","You see those houses? They're older than they look."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_pillar_02","Rivalry between the pillar dwellers is every bit as vicious as between the hive gangs."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_pillar_03","Pillar dwellers act as toll keepers between the districts. You want to get out of the Sump, you've got to make with a bribe."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_pillar_04","Nearly died in a place like this. Gunfight between two pillar gangs, and I got caught in between."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_sewer_01","Somehow the water down here looks even worse since the heretics moved in."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_sewer_02","You wouldn't want to drink that water, would you? But people do. For a couple of years. Then their skin starts sloughing off."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_sewer_03","Ragtown's just once facet of the Water Cartel's operation, believe it or not."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_sewer_04","You wouldn't think people would pay for that water, would you? But they do. They've no choice."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_01","I grew up in the Torrent - fought like Hel to escape. But there's no escaping your past, is there?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_02","The enforcers gave up on this place decades ago. The Administratum long before that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_03","Wasn't much better before the heretics moved in. Trust me on that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_04","The cartel laid down the law here for decades. The Emperor's Light barely flickers in the Torrent."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_01","Trader's Row. Takes me back. Wish I could burn the whole place down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_02","Trader's Row. Where someone's always buying, if you're selling. No questions asked."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_03","Factions of the cartel were always fighting over Trader's Row. The heretics sided with one and took the others out."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_04","Caligas the Knife ran Trader's Row when I was last here. Pity the heretics got to him before I did."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_upload_01","Good work! Now feed that cogitator array our poison pill."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_upload_02","Give those heretics our data package. Let them choke on it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_upload_03","Just the upload to go now. Get to it!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_upload_04","Now for the upload. Don't worry about being fancy, just get it done."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_use_passcode_01","No problem. Just input the cypher-ident, and we'll see what happens."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_use_passcode_02","You'll need that cypher-ident."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cartel_use_passcode_03","Locked up tight … good job you stole that cypher-ident."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_a_01","Your mission is to access the comms-plex dish atop Archivum Sycorax and relay an encrypted report."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_a_02","You're heading into Throneside to relay an encrypted report via the archivum comms-plex dish."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_a_03","It's a simple enough mission: proceed to Archivum Sycorax and use the comms-plex dish to transmit an encrypted report."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_a_04","Your mission is to relay an encrypted report using the Archivum Sycorax comms-plex dish."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_b_01","I'm told we can't employ the usual channels for this transmission, but I haven't been told why."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_b_02","This isn't usual procedure, but I'm sure Grendyl has reasons for the unorthodoxy."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_b_03","This isn't exactly by the book, but around here what is? I mean, look at who I'm talking to."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_b_04","If you're thinking this isn't standard procedure, you'd be right. Don't ask me why, because I don't know."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_c_01","The district's in heretics hands, so expect resistance. Lots of resistance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_brief_c_02","You're bound to have a fight on your hands before this is done, so be ready."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_elevator_02","Marking the elevator. Trust me, you'll want to use it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_elevator_03","Elevator location logged. Get there as quickly as you can."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_elevator_04","The elevator's not far. It's a good time to pick up the pace."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_01","Withdraw to the elevator. Leave no one behind."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_02","Elevator's arrived. Time to leave."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_03","Elevator's here. You need to get moving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_04","Get moving! Into the elevator before the heretics send reinforcements."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_first_objective_01","The Archivum isn't far, but you'll need to cross a Skylink bridge to get there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_first_objective_02","The Archivum isn't too far. Look for a Skylink bridge to carry you to the next enclavum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_first_objective_03","Make for the nearest Skylink bridge. You can proceed to Archivum Sycorax from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_first_objective_04","Once you reach the Skylink bridge you'll be clear to proceed to Archivum Sycorax."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_01","Don't be taken in by these statues. Heroism is often just a matter of timing. "
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_02","Statues are reminders of the ""good"" history. They erase as much as they commemorate."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_03","Atoma remembers its heroes ... even when no one's entirely certain why."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_04","For every hero remembered in bronze, a thousand more perish without comment. Tread carefully."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_02","The archivum's getting closer. You'll be there in no time."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_03","Stay together and work as a team. The archivum's nearly in sight."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_04","Still alive? See? It's not that bad. And you're nearly at the archivum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_01","Read outs are showing the main gate as sealed. Try the side entrance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_02","Main gate doesn't look like an option. You'll have to try something less obvious."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_03","The main approach isn't going to work here. Find a subtler path."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_04","Look for a side entrance. You're not getting through the main gate."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_01","Masozi can't extract you while the skyfire's live. Shut that relay down!"

"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_03","That relay controls the roof's skyfire. You'll want to shut it down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_04","There's a cut off for the roof's skyfire right here. You know what to do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_01","Nobody needs to hear it. Just get on with the mission."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_04","Some people don't know when they've got it easy."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_01","Not far now. One last push to the roof."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_02","Find a way to access the roof. We'll handle the rest from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_03","Can you make it to the roof? You'd better."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_04","Rest's over. It's time to get onto the roof."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_01","Finally! Everything's green from here. Begin transmission."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_02","Board looks stable ... connection established ... Send the transmission!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_03","Looking good ... Yes ... Yes ... Transmit. Now!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_04","Dish is in position! Get that signal away before more traitors arrive!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmitter_01","All right! Use your data-interrogators to align the dish."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmitter_02","This is a job for your data-interrogators. Break through the traitors' conditioning and align the dish."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmitter_03","The dish needs aligning. Unless you fancy doing it by hand, get your data-interrogators working."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_complex_transmitter_04","You need to realign the dish. Your data-interrogators can do the hard part for you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_01","The traitors have been crawling all over Metalfab 36, and now we know why: they've disabled the power matrix's cooling system."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_02","We've got a problem at Metalfab 36. Traitors have disabled the power matrix's cooling system."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_03","You're heading over to Metalfab 36. Heretics have somehow disabled the cooling system for the power matrix."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_04","Metalfab 36 is on the brink of total shutdown, maybe even destruction. The cooling system's offline, and that's bad news."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_01","Head for the control room, unlock the cryonic rods and flush the system. And do it fast."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_02","Emergency cryonic rods are locked off in the control room. If you can get them loose, you can flush the system. Good luck."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_03","Fight your way to the control room, unlock the cryonic rods and get the system under control. You think you can do that?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_04","Secure the control room, unlock the cryonic rods and get that facility back online. Don't let me down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_01","Losing that facility's tank production might cost us this war, so you're going to get the coolant back online."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_02","You need to get the coolant flowing again, or we'll lose the facility, and we need those battle tanks."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_03","We can't win this war without the facility's battle tanks, so that coolant has to start flowing again."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_04","Rannick's clear that we need the facility's battle tanks, which means you need to reactivate the coolant before everthing explodes."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_01","Head for the control chamber and find the cryonic rods."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_02","You need the cryonic rods that you'll find in the control chamber."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_03","Are you not at the Control Chamber yet? Pick up the pace."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_04","Get to the Control Chamber and find those cryonic rods."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_01","If it's any consolation, the heretics will be feeling the heat just as much."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_02","If it's hard for you, it's hard for the heretics. Should be a level playing field."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_03","Even when the cooling system's working, Metalfab 36 is one big oven."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_04","Metalfab 36 has a reputation for stifling heat, even when the coolant's flowing."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_01","Okay, this is your way into the hab."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_02","You're at the Ascender. Hopefully, it still works."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_03","This is the Ascender. You're making good time."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_04","Not too bad. Now get the Ascender moving, so we can get this done."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_01","You're heading into the Torrent. Rannick's identified a target that wants eliminating."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_02","I've had a Kill Mission go active down in the Torrent. Lucky you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_03","You're inbound to the Torrent. Intel's identified a high value target, and Rannick wants it dead."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_04","We've got a high value target down in the Torrent. You're to take it out."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_01","The target's holed up in an Enforcer Station. Using it as a fortress, or something."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_02","The target's turned an Enforcer Station into a private bolthole. Ironic, or what?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_03","You'll find the target in the Enforcer Station. It's ruined, but defensible."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_04","The Enforcer Station's abuzz with heretic activity, so it's a good bet you should be looking there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_01","You'll have quite a walk to get there, but good news! Everyone will be shooting at you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_02","You'll go in through the sewers, then make your way through the underhabs. Enjoy the pretty side of the Torrent!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_03","The sewers are your way in. From there, you'll be heading up into the Torrent proper."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_04","Go in through the sewers. Find your way up to the streets. Execute the target. Don't let me down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_01","Never much liked this place. The Water Cartel desecrated it long before the heretics did."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_02","Hasn't been an enforcer in this place for years, thanks to the Water Cartel."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_03","The Water Cartel drove the enforcers out years ago."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_04","Hard to believe there used to be enforcers here. Might still have a family if they'd stayed."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","There's been no law down here for a long time. Only Cartel 'justice'."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","Down here, the Emperor's Light is the only hope. Been that way for a long time."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_b_03","Enforcers? Not worth the effort. They're no friends to the starving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_b_04","Enforcers never made much difference down here. Not when it was needed."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","I fought to stay in the Cartel's good graces. Let's leave it at that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","You don't stay alive long in the Cartel and keep clean hands."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_b_03","I don't want to talk about it. Not to you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_b_04","I lost plenty in this place. Others lost more. Some of them, to me."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_b_01","It's actually not a bad choice. Strong walls, choke points, a deep armoury. He could do worse."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_b_02","The only thing that separates a prison from a fortress is which way the guns point."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_b_03","Don't be fooled. This place is a fortress. Holding the keys makes all the difference."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_b_04","I've seen bastions harder to crack than this prison. It's all a matter of perspective."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_01","That's the Enforcer Station. Target's inside."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_02","You'll find our Sanction Redactus target inside the Enforcer Station."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_03","Don't have fond memories of the Enforcer Station. There's always time to fix that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_04","Head on into the Enforcer Station. We don't have forever."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_01","You've got incoming! Stand your ground!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_02","They're coming for you! Send them to hel!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_03","You've got company! Hold out for the Ascender!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_04","Ascender's deploying. Stay alive until then!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_01","You can't reach the Enforcer Station from down here, so you'll have to find an Ascender."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_02","You need to reach the streets. An Ascender is your best bet."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_03","You're right in the bowels, but the best way to reach the Enforcer Station is from the streets."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_04","Make your way to the Ascender. We'll talk again once you're in the streets."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_01","As you can see, everything in the Torrent's falling apart."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_02","Believe it or not, this place is in better condition than much of the Torrent."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_03","Not pretty, is it? You should try living down here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_04","The Torrent's not exactly a work of art these days. Probably it never was."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_01","Last gasp. Get yourselves to the elevator. He's waiting for you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_02","Not far now. Find the elevator, and let's end this heretic."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_03","Keep going. There's an elevator that will take you to the Blocks."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_04","There's a prisoner transfer elevator close by. It'll take you straight to the Kill target."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_01","Ascender's in position. Get moving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_02","Ascender's here. Head for the streets."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_03","There'll be more coming. Get up the Ascender and get out of there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_04","That won't be the end of them. Better you climb the Ascender while you can."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_01","Waste from a dozen habs gets pumped through here. Hopefully you'll be gone by then."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_02","I hope you're gone before they flush the cistern."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_03","At least the heretics won't see you coming."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_04","Can't always be sunshine and flowers, can it?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_01","Used to live in a block just like this. I'm never going back."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_02","Wasn't so long ago that I was living around here. Let the past stay where it is."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_03","This whole district's crumbling. I pity those who still live around here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_04","Keep going. You've plenty of ground left to cover."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_01","Get through the assembly line, and you're almost there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_02","Make your away through the assembly line."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_03","Smelter Control is just beyond the assembly line."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_04","Get through the assembly line ... It isn't far now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_01","Metalfab 36 is in trouble. The primary smelter's offline, and production's crawled to a stop."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_02","Metalfab 36's primary smelter has been taken offline. Your job's to get it working again."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_03","The primary smelter at Metalfab 36 has been disabled by enemy action. Fix it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_04","You're heading to Metalfab 36 where heretics have disabled the primary smelter."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_01","Knowing our enemies, a daemonic infestation seems likely. Cleanse and purge."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_02","Seems a daemonic infestation has corrupted the systems. Purge that infestation and the situation will resolve."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_03","There's a daemonic infestation at play here. Purging the corruption should resolve the situation."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_04","A daemonic infestation has been suggested. Purge it to get the systems online."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_01","We need those production lines back in action. Don't let Rannick down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_02","Those production lines are vital. We can't afford any mistakes today."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_03","Get the production lines running again. The fate of Atoma might just depend upon them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_04","These production lines are vital. Rannick wants them operational again right now!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_01","That's the supply elevator. Get it moving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_02","That's the supply elevator. Looks like you'll have to call it up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_03","You'll need to call the supply elevator to your level."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_04","You've reached the supply elevator. It's a good start, but you need to keep moving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_first_objective_01","There's a supply elevator close by that will get you to the smelter complex."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_first_objective_02","The smelter complex can be accessed by supply elevator."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_first_objective_03","You're heading for a supply elevator. It's just about the fastest way down into the smelter complex."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_first_objective_04","Find the supply elevator, and be quick about it. You're bound to draw attention. You always do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_01","You'd never get through here on a shift change. The elevator's not far."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_02","This place is wall-to-wall during shift change. As it is, you should reach the elevator in minutes."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_03","You can reach the elevator through here. Strange to see it without the crowds of labourers."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_04","Elevator's just past labour oversight. You can't miss it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_01","Drive out the daemonic matter and the smelter should come back online."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_02","Get the daemonic matter purged! That should get the smelter running!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_03","Purge the daemonic corruption and let's get this smelter running!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_04","Purge the machinery of all corruption, then we can fire the smelter back up!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_01","That's the smelter. Good work getting this far."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_02","Smelter's up ahead. Time to get this place up and running."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_03","There's the smelter. See? This was the right way."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_04","That's the smelter. Let's see if we can coax a smile out of Rannick."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_01","That should keep Rannick happy. Hit the restart, and you can get out of there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_02","Smelter's ready to go. You just need to flush the system."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_03","Smelter's returning to normal operation. Flush the system."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_04","Looks good from here. Get the system flushed, and we're done."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_01","The particulates masked Storm Raptor's approach. You'll breath easier soon."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_02","Masozi used the particulates to conceal your drop. Air quality improves in the next section."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_03","The particulates should have confused the enemy auspex array. You'll breathe easier soon."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_04","Sorry. Had to put you down beyond enemy auspex range. The next section has cleaner air."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_superstructure_01","Good progress. Keep moving through the superstructure."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_use_elevator_01","That's the elevator. Proceed with the mission."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_use_elevator_02","Take the elevator down to the smelter complex."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_forge_use_elevator_03","Elevator's here. Time to get to the heart of all this."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_03","The resulting heretical transmission is swamping that area of the Hive, weakening the resolve of the otherwise loyal."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_01","You're going in to shut that signal down and gather data on the signal's point of origin. Don't let me down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_02","Terminate the signal and gather intel on the point of origin. We need to know where it's coming from."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_03","Shut the signal down and get me actionable intel on where it's coming from. We need this shut down."

"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_briefing_b_03","That Den is located in the Carnival, so you'll be surrounded by enemies the whole time - though you should be used to that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_briefing_c_01","Fight your way to the den, extract whatever intel you can from the heretics' systems and destroy their apparatus."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_briefing_c_02","This is as much an intel mission as it is a sabotage one. Don't come back empty-handed. I want formulae, distribution nodes ... the works."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_briefing_c_03","Destroying the lab is only part of the mission. I want actionable intel - the juicier the better. Don't disappoint."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_city_view_a_01","Looks almost peaceful, doesn't it? But this is enemy territory. Don't forget it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_city_view_a_02","Serene, isn't it? This district fell to the Moebians with barely a fight. The lack of scars is proof of treachery."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_city_view_a_03","This district should be in ruins. It would be, had anyone actually fought the invaders."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_closer_b_01","All trade down here is illicit."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_closer_b_02","Stay alert, team. If Krall's right, resistance will only increase from here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_closer_b_03","It may not be the illicit trade we seek, of course."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_closer_d_01","How very reassuring."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_closer_d_02","I suppose time will tell."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_closer_d_03","Let us hope the Emperor is smiling on us."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_01","You're going to need an alternate exit. Better create one."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_02","I think you'd better create your own exit ... with explosives."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_03","Your best way out is through the wall. Do you still have a detpack?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_a_01","Comms restored ... we thought we'd lost you for a moment."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_a_02","Apologies for the silence. I'm pleased to see that you survived."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_a_03","Strike Team? ... Good, comms are working again. And you're not all dead. That's a bonus."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_c_01","That's enough. Team? You need to reach those production facilities."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_c_02","Be quiet, Krall. Team? Let's find that production facility. And do try to stay alert for other little surprises."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_c_03","Mission-relevant communication only. Team? You're cleared to press on to the production facility. It can't be far."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_01","Concealing illicit goods and trades is a time-honoured tradition around here. This isn't exactly innovation."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_02","I should have petitioned Morrow for more teams. We could have shut done every heretic-sympathiser in the Carnival."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_03","The heretics won't have created this sub-chamber - but you can bet they executed the smugglers who did."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_b_01","Stay on your toes. We don't know what we're walking into."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_b_02","Just don't get complacent. This isn't our territory - it's theirs."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_b_03","No matter. We have a mission to complete."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_first_event_start_a_01","That's strange, the vox board is lighting up-- [static]"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_first_event_start_a_02","Krall, is your vox playing up? Mine is-- [static]"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_first_event_start_a_03","Hold on team, my vox is suffering some sort of-- [static]"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_gas_a_01","Tox gas? You'd better find a way to vent the system."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_gas_a_02","That gas is toxic. You'll need to vent the system."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_gas_a_03","Quickly! Vent the system before your lungs rot!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_hurry_a_01","We've lost too much time. Keep moving!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_hurry_a_02","Reinforcements will be coming. Move faster!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_hurry_a_03","Don't dawdle. This is going to get sticky."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_inside_a_01","Very cosy. These criminals have it better than honest soldiers."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_inside_a_02","This facility has been established for some time. Have the Moebians been here that long, or is this a takeover?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_inside_a_03","We're clearly dealing with an established set up. The enforcers have been looking the other way for some time."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_a_01","Looks like they don't want unexpected visitors. Let's get that door open. The production facilities can't be far."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_a_02","A locked door. Practical, but it draws attention. Get it open. I'll wager we'll find the production facilities somewhere beyond."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_a_03","Get that door unsealed. The production facilities can't be far. But be ready - the heretics won't take kindly to your presence."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_first_objective_a_01","Let's get moving. We know the Obscura Den is operating near Crimson Plaza. You'll need to find the exact location."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_first_objective_a_02","We only have an approximate location on the Obscura Den. Start by searching the alleyways around Crimson Plaza."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_first_objective_a_03","The Obscura Den is thought to be in the vicinity of Crimson Plaza. That's where we start."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_force_field_a_01","You can't shoot your way through that field. You'll have to shut it off."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_force_field_a_02","You'll need to shut down that refractor field. Find a way!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_force_field_a_03","There's a refractor field protecting the genesis chamber. Disable it!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_01","I have a location on the genesis chamber for the stimms. Find it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_02","We've hit paydirt. The heretics have a genesis chamber. Shut it down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_03","The data suggests a genesis chamber is within your reach. You know what to do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_a_01","Look at it all. Half the district must be involved in this enterprise."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_a_02","The rot goes deep indeed. There's no sign of this in the upper streets."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_a_03","The scale of this ... It makes me wonder if the workers ever noticed the change in their masters."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_01","Keep it moving. You can bet heretic reinforcements are on the way."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_02","We're on a clock, team. The heretics aren't going to sit idly by."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_03","Pick your feet up. After the business at the Obscura Den, you can be sure of company."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_01","You forget. I've seen your operation aboard ship."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_02","A fine protest from someone always up to his armpits in body parts."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_03","You'll forgive me if I don't find your disavowal convincing?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_01","That's it, and not a moment before time. Auspexes are showing enemy reinforcements are inbound. Time to get out of there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_02","Good work, team. Masozi will be waiting for you on the upper levels. There should be a service elevator nearby. Use it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_03","I think we've done all we can here. Find a service elevator and get back to the surface. Masozi will extract you from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_01","Yes, but it feels good. It might even save a few lives."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_02","What can I say? Sometimes I'm petty."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_03","We win by inches. And besides, destruction can be satisfying."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_a_01","All right. You're in. Deploy your servo-skull. Let's gather as much intel as we can."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_a_02","This is it. Let's put your servo-skull to work. The more intel we can gather, the better."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_a_03","Time to deploy that servo-skull. This facility is a glimmer mine of intel, and I want every last scrap."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_01","I think that's everything we're going to get. Destroy the synthesizer chambers and get out of there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_02","That's a good data haul, Team. Now destroy the synthesizer chambers and extract yourselves."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_03","That's plenty for the scribes to pick over. Destroy the synthesizer chambers as a parting gift, and come home."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_new_a_01","I need to analyse this data. Sweep, clear and await updates."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_new_a_02","Secure the structure while I analyse this data."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_new_a_03","That's a substantial data haul. I need time to analyse it. Secure the perimeter."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_b_01","I'm so very glad you approve."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_b_02","Please keep your personal observations off this channel."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_b_03","I'm sorry, but is this relevant?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_01","The strike team is inbound to one of Tertium's seediest districts. I thought you might have specialist knowledge."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_02","Your knowledge of biological malfeasance and illegal trade proved too valuable to pass up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_03","Who else would I call on in the matter of biological criminality?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_01","I'm sure ..."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_02","Indeed ..."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_03","Naturally ..."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_streets_a_01","It's worrying just how quickly occupation becomes normal for the occupied."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_streets_a_02","The Moebians have already made this district their own. It sets a troubling precedent."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_raid_streets_a_03","Where is the resistance to the occupation. Has everyone simply given up?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_01","Special issue ammunition's getting hard to come by. Rannick wants you to fix that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_02","Sometimes it takes more than a lasgun to do the job. Unfortunately, the other stuff's hard to get."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_03","There's always pressure on our special ammo reserves. You're going to alleviate it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_04","We need more special ammo for some of our covert ops. You're going to get it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_01","The Scabs have a stockpile at the Chasm Station Logistratum. You'll be raiding it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_02","Lucky for us, the Chasm Station Logistratum is a one-stop warehouse for this stuff."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_03","The Scabs are clearing their ammo supplies through the Chasm Station Logistratum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_04","Recon report that the Scabs have plenty of what we need at Chasm Station Logistratum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_01","Secure the area, identify the gear and get it aboard the retrieval valkyries. Understood?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_02","You're to secure the area, grab the crates and get them aboard the retrieval craft. Don't screw it up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_03","Once you're inside, you can grab the crates prep them for extraction. Shouldn't be hard."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_04","It's up to you to find what we're after and get it aboard the retrieval craft. Can you handle that?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_01","Looks like the  elevator's out. You'll have to find another way down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_02","Elevator's out, but the shaft looks intact. You can climb down to maintenance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_03","Elevator's out. Make your way down the shaft instead."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_04","Doesn't look like the elevator's going to help you. Find another way down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_01","Masozi can thank you later."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_02","It would be a shame for Masozi to die in a fireball."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_03","Get to it. You don't have much time before the Scabs come for you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_04","I wondered if you'd work that out for yourselves."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","If we could hold this Logistratum, we'd fully control the transit infrastructure for surrounding districts. Unfortunately, we can't."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","The Logistratum controls the transit network. I wish we had the troops to hold it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_b_03","She who holds the Logistratum controls everything that comes in and out of this hive sector."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_b_04","It's a strategically important location. Rannick would be wise to seize it, as soon as we've the means."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","Ran a few scores here, back in the day. I'm not proud of it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","I was part of the unofficial supply chain between here and the Torrent. Wasn't a good time."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_b_03","Used to be smuggler, didn't I? It's not something I remember fondly."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_b_04","Did a lot of work in the Subrails. Illegal work, and best forgotten."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_b_01","It's not for you. Rannick has other teams in the field doing the really nasty jobs."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_b_04","Your role is to acquire the ammunition. Someone else will use it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_01","Supplies marked! Get it done!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_02","Supplies are tagged. Let's get what we came for!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_03","Get that ammunition to the valkyrie!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_04","Time to move! Get that ammunition!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_first_objective_01","First stop? Maintenance. I know a back way in to the Logistratum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_first_objective_02","There's a back way into the Logistratum via maintenance. Move out."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_first_objective_03","Frontal assault isn't going to work, but you can get in through maintenance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_first_objective_04","I know a better way in than the front gate. Head for maintenance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_01","Locked? Not unexpected. Put your data-interrogator to work."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_02","Maintenance access is sealed? Nothing your data-interrogator can't handle."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_03","You'll need to unseal the access with your data-interrogator."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_04","There's maintenance access. Use your data-interrogator to get it open."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_logistratum_01","You've reached the Logistratum. There's something to be said for using the back door."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_logistratum_02","You're in the Logistratum, and the heretics are none the wiser."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_logistratum_03","Looks like the Logistratum's all yours. For the moment."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_logistratum_04","We can't hold this Logistratum for long, but we don't need to."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_lower_track_01","All right. Leave the Subrails behind and follow the Supply Track."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_lower_track_02","You're leaving the Subrails now. That Supply Track will lead you straight to the Logistratum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_lower_track_03","Get down onto the Supply Track. It'll take you to the Logistratum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_lower_track_04","You can get down to the Supply Track from here. Next stop: the Logistratum."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_01","The Subrails are Chasm Station's dirty secret. You can smuggle all sorts through here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_02","Plenty of smuggled goods pass through these Subrails. People, too."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_03","Chasm Station's Subrails were a smuggler's dream. Some things never change."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_04","You know your way around these Subrails, they'll take you anywhere for ten districts in any direction."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_refectory_01","Odd to see this place empty. Come shift change the workers stood wall-to-wall."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_refectory_02","Used to be this place smelled of spices and roasted meat. Now it's stale blood and decay."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_refectory_03","I still can't get over how lifeless this place looks now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_refectory_04","There used to be a preacher at the centre of the main street. Likely he's dead now. They all are."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_01","Don't worry. You'll be in the thick of things soon."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_02","I'd enjoy the quiet. It'll get loud soon."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_03","At least this way you get boots on the ground without getting shot."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_04","Oddly, Masozi didn't fancy flying into the Logistratum's skyfire defences."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_station_approach_01","Chasm Terminus was as much a shrine as a transit hub. It will be again."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_station_approach_02","You can reach the station's maintenance area up ahead."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_station_approach_03","The Scabs will pay for what they've done here. Make your way to maintenance."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_rails_station_approach_04","No time to mourn the destruction. Maintenance access isn't far."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_01","Head on past the archive. It's not far now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_02","The archive's not your target. Not for now. We'll be back here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_03","Keep the archive to your right and you won't go far wrong."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_04","Archivum Sycorax looks mostly intact. That's probably for the best."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_01","Bridge is down. You can move into Enclavum Baross."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_02","The path to Enclavum Baross is open. What are you waiting for?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_03","You've got a clear path. Move on into Enclavum Baross."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_04","And ... Yes, it's down. Proceed with the mission."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_01","That's the Bridge of Many Martyrs. The Aegis Station is just beyond."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_02","Once you're across the Bridge of Many Martyrs you can get this wrapped up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_03","Can you see the Aegis Station? Cross the Bridge of Many Martyrs and let's get this settled."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_04","Head across the Bridge of Many Martyrs. The Aegis Station is yours for the taking."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_01","Seems someone raised the Skylink. Someone else will have to lower it ... i.e. you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_02","You can't cross that Skylink, not until you lower it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_03","The Skylink's not going to help you unless you get it lowered."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_04","Ah ... Looks like you need to lower the Skylink."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_01","The heretics are growing in number and boldness. They've even made it into Throneside."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_02","Throneside has a heretic problem, and I want you to help bring it to an end."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_03","Reports warn of increasing numbers of heretics in Throneside. That just won't do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_04","We're getting reports of increased heretic presence in Throneside. This isn't acceptable."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_01","Today's target is the Aegis Station in Enclavum Baross. It's old, but serviceable."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_02","There's an antiquated Aegis Station in Enclavum Baross. It should get us a foothold."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_03","We're going to use the old Aegis Station in Enclavum Baross to get some breathing room."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_04","Your target is the dilapidated Aegis Station in Enclavum Baross."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_01","Get inside, throw the heretics out, and keep it in our hands until reinforcements arrive."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_02","Cast out any heretics you encounter and wait for reinforcements. That's all."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_03","Cleanse the station and hold it against the inevitable counter attack while I send in another team."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_04","Get the station secured and hold it until reinforcements arrive. Simple enough, yes?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Just hold your ground and let your weapons do the work."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Keep this channel clear! We might need it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_01","You'll want to find the Skylink bridge to reach Enclavum Baross."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_02","Enclavum Baross is the next district over. You'll need to find the Skylink."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_03","The Skylink will get you into Enclavum Baross. Find it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_04","Reach the Skylink bridge and cross into Enclavum Baross. We don't have all night."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_01","It's a good start, but the mission's not done. Find that Aegis Station."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_02","The Aegis Station isn't far, so let's get this done."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_03","You're still alive? Well done. Let's get to the Aegis Station."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_04","Move out. The Aegis Station isn't that far now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_01","You'll need power cells to get that bridge moving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_02","No power to speak of. Looks like you need to find some power cells."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_03","There are bound to be some power cells close by. Lucky for you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_04","Power cells should be nearby. Track them down and get the bridge powered."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_01","You're in. Get that Aegis Station locked down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_02","Soon as you have that Aegis Station secured, I'll call for reinforcements."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_03","Right. You're in the Aegis Station. You know what to do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_04","Secure the Aegis Station. Don't let me down, do you hear?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_01","This is no place for our kind ... until they need us."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_02","You and I aren't good enough to be seen here ... There must be a war on."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_03","We're good enough to defend these streets but not to live here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_04","Only reason you're here is to kill heretics. Don't get aspirations."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_01","Lord Militant Ennic Baross is revered hereabouts. The truth is darker."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_02","History records that Ennic Baross was a hero. History lies."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_03","Lord Margrave claims Ennic Baross was one of Atoma's greatest. Grendyl's records tell another story."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_04","Look upon the likeness of Ennic Baross. A bold hero, some would have you believe. I'm not one of them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_a_01","The heretics have seized Chasm Terminus. Let's make that work for us."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_a_02","Chasm Terminus fell to the heretics a long time ago, but we can use that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_a_03","Chasm Terminus is in enemy hands, but that doesn't mean it's worthless."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_a_04","This one's an infiltration mission. Get in. Get out alive, if you can."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_b_01","Access the station's auto-scheduler, and you can redirect a train - and its arch-heretic passenger."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_b_02","You're going to access the station's auto-scheduler and redirect a high value target."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_b_03","You can splice into the station's auto-scheduler from a nearby market. Then you can redirect an arch-heretic's train."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_b_04","With a little tech-wizardry, you're going to redirect an arch-heretic's transport train."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_c_01","That passenger is vital to the enemy's battle plans. Take them out."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_c_02","You'll be waiting on the platform. And you'll kill them. Is that clear?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_c_03","You'll be waiting when they arrive. Use the surprise to your advantage. Kill them. Walk away."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_briefing_c_04","Kill the target, and we'll consider you a step closer to having earned your freedom."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_01","I'm not surprised this place is so full. Lists of prohibited items change constantly on Atoma."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_02","It's not just contrabrand in here - there's a fee for carrying almost anything from one sector to another."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_03","Enforcers are always quick to confiscate. Their superiors don't care, and they can always sell the goods on."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_04","Some of this stuff's illegal, certainly, but not all. Maybe not even most. Laws are for the wealthy."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_cross_station_01","You're almost out of time! Get to the other side of the station!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_cross_station_02","Time's almost gone! Get across the station!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_cross_station_03","Time's almost up! Get across the station! Now!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_cross_station_04","Target's almost here! You need to get to the other side of the station! Right now!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Barely made it, but you're here. Get it done."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","At last. Time to go to work."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_03","Just in the nick of time."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_04","Time to go to work."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Make Rannick proud."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Time to justify my faith in you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_03","Remember: there is no place for failure."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_04","I vouched for you. Prove me right."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_01","You know everything I do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_02","It's need to know. You don't have a need. Nor do I."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_03","What does it matter? Just eliminate them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_04","What would it change? You have your mission."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_enter_station_01","Time's running short. Get to the platform before it's too late."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_enter_station_02","Recon shows the target's inbound. You need to hurry up!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_enter_station_03","We don't have much time. Press forward. I want that target dead!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_enter_station_04","All right. Make your way through Chasm Terminus and get to the right platform."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_head_to_market_01","You're coming up on the marketplace. Use the vent tunnels for access."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_head_to_market_02","The vent tunnels will take you to the marketplace. You just need to find them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_head_to_market_03","Access the vent tunnels and follow them to the marketplace."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_head_to_market_04","You'll be using the vent tunnels to access the marketplace."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_01","Promising ... so far. We need to access the auto-scheduler. Set your data-interrogators."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_02","Good - it looks like you can get access from here. Set your data-interrogators."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_03","Good work. Once they have access, your data-interrogators can redirect any train in the region."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_04","This is the place - get to work! The data-interrogators should get you access to the auto-scheduler."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_01","It isn't kind work, but it saves lives."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_02","The Imperium prospers on the blood of those who sacrifice in its name."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_03","We cannot flinch from stern measures. Even on Atoma."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_04","The necessary is seldom easy on the eye."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_01","You've only just reached the maintenance bay? Pick up the pace!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_02","You're at the maintenance bay? Hurry up, or you'll miss the target!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_03","You're moving too slowly! Press on through the maintenance bay!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_04","You have to move faster! Get through the maintenance bay and head for the station!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_b_01","We do what Grendyl and Rannick believe to be important."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_b_02","This was Rannick's plan. If you disapprove, I suggest you take it up with him."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_b_03","Concern yourself with Rannick's orders, nothing more. You'll live longer."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_b_04","Rannick's orders were very clear. You'd do better not to question."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_b_01","We do what we must. There can be no quarter in this war."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_b_02","Heretics deserve all they get. It's as simple as that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_b_03","This is about survival. We do whatever it takes."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_b_04","Mercy is for the weak. Honour is for the fool. We can afford to be neither."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_b_01","Chasm Terminus's systems are high security. Its outer relays, less so. The heretics haven't worked that out yet."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_b_02","A transit hub's high-security systems are a lot tougher to splice. The signal relays make for easier targets."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_b_03","It's no easy matter splicing into a transit hub's systems. Subverting signal relays is faster and simpler."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_b_04","Chasm Terminus's systems are tougher to splice. By splicing into the signals after they leave the station, we get the same result, easier."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_01","You're not here to mingle. Keep moving."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_02","The garrison doesn't concern you. Move up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_03","The garrison have their mission. You have yours."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_04","They will do their duty. As will we all - one way or another."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_tanks_01","These fortifications won't last against a real assault. We need to change things up."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_tanks_02","These fortifications may look impressive, but it won't take much to sweep them away."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_tanks_03","I don't know how much longer this bridge will hold. All we can do is make the enemy pay in blood."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_tanks_04","Thank the Emperor that Tertium's covered in bridges like this. We need the choke points."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_01","All right. We're ready to upload. Let's reel this traitor into our net."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_02","Interrogators have access. Time to redirect that train."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_03","Amended schedule's ready for upload. It's our train now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_04","That's it! That's it! Hit the upload to redirect the train."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_01","You'll have to cut through Ragtown. Lucky you."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_02","Cut through Ragtown. The silo's not far now."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_03","Welcome to Ragtown. Get through it, and you'll be at the silo."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_04","Not exactly Tertium's pretty side, is it? The silo isn't far."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_01","I've crossed that bridge more times than I care to recall."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_02","The waters beneath the bridge are thick with bodies. Jumpers, and the pushed."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_03","Put the bridge behind you as soon as you can, that's my advice."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_04","So many have died on that bridge. Have a care you don't join them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_01","Tertium's got a problem with its water supply. Chiefly, that it's no good for drinking."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_02","The heretics have compromised Tertium's water supply. That's not a good thing, in case you didn't know."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_03","Tertium can't fight without a sustainable water supply, so guess what the heretics have gone after?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_04","Food. Ammo. Water. Tertium's okay on the first two, but the heretics are making the third scarce."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_01","The trouble's confined to a single silo. For now. The Heretics are pumping their poison in from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_02","We know which silo the Heretics have corrupted, so that's a good place to start."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_03","The Heretics have taken control of a storage silo. You can bet that's where the trouble is."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_04","We've identified the storage silo that's at the heart of the contagion. That's where you start."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_01","You know the drill. Drive the daemon off, and hopefully that'll get the water clean enough to drink."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_02","Tertium needs that water, so drive the daemon off and hope that fixes the problem."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_03","Drive the daemon out, and if the Emperor wills we'll get drinkable water in the Hive again."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_04","Get down there and deal with the daemon. By any means necessary. You know how this works."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_01","A pity the Ragged King's Court is still standing."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_02","I keep hoping the Ragged King's Court will have collapsed. There's always next time."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_03","Not many walked this road into Cartel HQ and came out again."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_04","That's what's left of the Water Cartel. Nothing last forever. Except the Master of Mankind."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_01","The daemon didn't fancy messing with you. Clean water restored!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_02","Good. We needed this place back in our hands."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_03","The water isn't pure - never is around here - but it's drinkable. Come on home."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_04","Water's clearing already. Good work today."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Its origin point is somewhere in Sector Periferus. This is just a part of its being."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","It's not ideal, but it could be worse. Long as we can keep it under control."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_b_03","Rannick says it's testing its strength - seeing how far it can extrude into the mortal world."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_b_04","This one's still weak. It's up to us to make sure it stays that way."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Trust to Rannick's plan. Everything in its own good time, he says."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","It's never that simple. That's what Rannick says."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_b_03","Better to know where they are. At least, that's Rannick's theory."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_b_04","Rannick would rather keep them contained."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Lord Margrave has never cared for those he can't see. The blindness of rank."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","You have to pick a side to survive down here."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_b_03","Not everything in the Imperium is black and white. This place is grey as they come."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_b_04","You can't know the Torrent until you've lived here. Better you never do."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_01","Destroy those daemonic growths!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_02","Target the daemonic growths! Take them out!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_03","Let's get the water flowing again! Destroy the daemonic growths!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_04","Destroy the daemonic growths and you can end this!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_01","You'll have to go into Water Cartel territory if you're to find an elevator down."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_02","Make for the Ragged King's Court. You can reach the streets from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_03","You need to head for the Ragged King's Court. I can guide you down from there."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_04","Head for the centre of Ragtown. There'll be an elevator on the way."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_flush_01","Time to go to work. Set the auto-cleanse running but don't let the daemon interfere."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_flush_02","You're here. Flush the system and drive out the daemon. Don't let it get the better of you!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_flush_03","You can flush the system, but the daemon's bound to stop you. I don't have to tell you what comes next, do I?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_flush_04","Trigger the system flush. Drive the daemon out. Try not to die. Simple enough, don't you think?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_b_01","This is the nice part of the Torrent, if you can believe it."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_b_02","This is as close to posh as the Torrent gets. Everyone else goes in the drink."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_b_03","It's not great, but it's the best Tertium has. That's worth something."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_b_04","You stick around here, you'll see it can only get worse. Trust me."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_01","Just like old times... Now get down to the Bazaar."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_02","No tears for that lot. Continue with the mission."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_03","Bit off more than they could chew, didn't they? Head down to the Bazaar."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_04","Looks like you're safe to proceed to the Bazaar."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_01","Soon as you call that elevator, you'll get company."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_02","You're being watched. They'll attack as soon as you call the elevator."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_03","Call the elevator, but watch your backs. Trust me."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_04","Call the elevator, but remain vigilant. They won't let you leave without a fight."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_01","The silo's just through here. Better get ready."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_02","You're almost to the silo. Weapons up!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_03","Silo's close. Get it done."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_04","You not at the silo yet? Better fix that."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_01_b_01","They can still accomplish their mission. I have faith in them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_01_d_01","It is an opportunity."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_02_a_01","Gone. Again."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_02_c_01","Let them. They don't know what they're up against."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_03_b_01","Then we keep moving, stay ahead of them."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_03_d_01","Grendyl gave me a free hand."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_arrival_01_c_01","I need her alive!"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_briefing_a_01","I have something special for you today. Wyrmwood agents have confirmed the location of the Karnak twins: two of Wolfer's key war leaders."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_briefing_b2_01","If anyone knows where Wolfer's hiding, it's them. Take them down, but leave one breathing. I want a prisoner capable of talking."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_briefing_b_01","The twins have made something of a name for themselves since returning to Atoma ... and they have a body count to match."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_briefing_c_01","We can't risk Wolfer knowing we're coming, so this mission is strictly off the books. Get in, get one of the twins to ""volunteer"" and do the Emperor proud."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_exchange_01_b_01","This isn't obsession. It's strategy. We need to fight back."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_exchange_01_d_01","And how many more will die while you scratch at your data slate?"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_exchange_01_f_01","Yes ... It will."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_b_01","No. We are so close."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_d_01","I have to get to Wolfer. I have to know ..."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_f_01","I ..."
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_h_01","No, you can't! You can't do this-- [Click of Vox connection failing]"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_mission_start_b_01","We have a line on the Karnak twins. Wyrmwood Agent 42--"
"loc_explicator_a__mission_twins_mission_start_d_01","No. We can't miss this opportunity. The strike team is already committed."
"loc_explicator_a__narrative_event_bay_01_01","Cut them down, for Throne’s sake!"
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_b_01","Daemons don't occupy space the same way we do. You wouldn't understand it. I don't."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_b_02","Just don't think about it. You'll sleep better that way."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_b_03","It's not good to speculate about such things."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_b_04","Saying things like that's a good way to end up in a catechizer's chair."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_b_01","It's a bleak situation, sure. But we fight on. That's the calling. Got that?"
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_b_02","That better not be defeatism I hear."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_b_03","Find a better attitude, or it'll get worse for you a lot quicker."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_b_04","Perhaps you're tempted to join the enemy, is that it?"
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_b_01","The heretics seek salvation from pain and mortality. They're cowards."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_b_02","The heretics believe that by becoming vessels of disease, they'll be spared. They're fools."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_b_03","To the heretics, these diseases are proof that their god loves them. It's sickening."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_b_04","By embracing disease, the heretics hope to be spared its torments. They're deluded."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_b_01","Don't say that name! Don't even think it!"
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_b_02","You should be careful. Doesn't take much to fall into heresy. A name would do it."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_b_03","Don't let Rannick hear you saying that name."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_b_04","Some names should not be uttered. Especially unthinkingly."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_b_01","Fire can cleanse. Damaged sectors can be rebuilt. Very little is lost forever."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_b_02","We do not give the heretics an inch of victory. I'll destroy Tertium before I let them have it."

"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_b_04","These daemons rise and fall with the plague. We diminish the plague, we diminish the corruption."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_01","I don't like what I'm seeing ... There's corruption everywhere."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_02","Looks like the heretics got what they wanted - this region's corrupted."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_03","Reading a lot of corruption from up here. Tread carefully, and don't get infected."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_04","My contacts in the region are warning of some kind of infestation. Watch your step."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","They're professionals. They'll get the job done."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","There's plenty of inhuman slime in Tertium at the best of times."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","Practise caution, but remember you're there to do a job."
"loc_explicator_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","This mission won't wait. Daemonic filth or not, we'll have to take the risks."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_a_01","I've had reports of power failures down there. Expect low-light engagements."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_a_02","Power failures have provoked a series of blackouts in your area. Proceed with caution."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_a_03","You'll notice it's a bit gloomier down there than normal. We're working to identify the cause."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_a_04","Rolling blackouts have made this drop a little more challenging. Don't worry, I have faith in you."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_b_01","Could be heretics, could be gangers ... There's always someone causing trouble."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_b_02","I'd say it was the work of gangers, but they've all been quiet since the invasion."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_b_03","Gangers used to pull this all the time. Protection racket, I think the enforcers called it."
"loc_explicator_a__power_circumstance_start_b_04","Gangers used to play this trick. The conduit faults could be found and fixed ... for a price."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_end_event_01_01","Let's give them a welcome they won't survive!"
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_end_event_03_01","More of them coming in!"
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_end_event_conversation_a_01","We die fighting. Agreed?"
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_firefight_conversation_a_01","You're actually not bad at this."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_gameplay_hub_a_02","Greetings, ""criminal""."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_gameplay_hub_a_03","We meet again, ""criminal""."

"loc_explicator_a__prologue_gameplay_hub_training_deck_04","Psykhanium. Now. I'm losing patience."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_hub_go_chapel_01","You're wanted in the Sanctum Dictatis. Seems the Inquisitor wants to take a look at you. Let's hope you don't disappoint."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_hub_go_mission_board_a_01","So now you know what's at stake."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_hub_go_mission_board_b_01","The Inquisitor clearly thinks you have what it takes, and as you've come through all that unscathed, Tertium shouldn't hold too many terrors for you."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_hub_go_mission_board_c_01","Report to the Mission Terminal for your first assignment."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_hub_go_training_grounds_a_01","So far, so good. Next up, you're to report to Sefoni at the Psykhanium for additional training."
"loc_explicator_a__prologue_hub_go_training_grounds_b_01","Take my advice: don't stare. She doesn't like it."

"loc_explicator_a__prologue_hub_mourningstar_intro_b_01","Inquisitor Grendyl’s voidship, and your home from now until you're no longer of use to us."

"loc_explicator_a__ranged_gameplay_07_01","Come on!"
"loc_explicator_a__shipmistress_hub_announcement_a_33_b_01","Well said, Lady Brahms. Rejects? You will make the Emperor proud!"
"loc_explicator_a__shipmistress_hub_announcement_a_61_b_01","Well, rejects? How do you answer? Who do you fight for?"
"loc_explicator_a__shipmistress_hub_announcement_b_25_b_01","I do only as my duty dictates, shipmistress."
"loc_explicator_a__shipmistress_hub_announcement_b_26_b_01","It ... It would be my honour, shipmistress."
"loc_explicator_a__static_01","[Static]"
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_a_01","You will have heard by now that I have been returned to duty."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_b_01","It appears that I overstepped my authority."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_c_01","... but I will not apologise for placing you in harm's way."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_d_01","We are all here to fight - and die - for the Emperor ... and for Atoma."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_e_01","Rannick is a brilliant man, but he makes Lord Margrave seem empathic."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_f_01","When he looks at Atoma he sees squares on the board and resources to exploit, not people crying out for salvation."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_g_01","I worry that his caution marks the road to Exterminatus."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_h_01","Today, I saw an opportunity."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_i_01","Should another arise I will seize it - and I will call upon you."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_j_01","Whatever happens, we must keep the faith and keep fighting."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_epilogue_02_k_01","The Inquisition is Atoma's only hope."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_prologue_01_a_01","I hope you're rested Reject, because I have a particular mission that requires your attention."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_prologue_01_b_01","We have a chance to reshape the course of the war and only a brief window in which to pursue it."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_prologue_01_c_01","Gather your preferred Strike Team - assuming you have one fit to fight - and report to the Mission Terminal."
"loc_explicator_a__twins_prologue_01_d_01","The Emperor Protects."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_01","I'm seeing reports of a ventilation failure, but not the cause. Air's still breathable, no matter how it looks."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_02","The vent system's not working right. The air's safe to breathe, but that's about all I can say."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_03","Something's gone sideways with the vent system. Doesn't look pretty, but it should be safe to breathe."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_04","There's always something wrong in Tertium. Today it's the vent system, as you can probably see."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_01","The vent systems have never been reliable. That's centuries of mismanagement for you."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_02","Like so much of Tertium, the vent systems have been hanging by a thread at the best of times."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_03","You should count yourself lucky it's not poison gas. Stranger things have happened."
"loc_explicator_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_04","It's not poisonous. Probably. At least, none of you have died yet. That's a good sign."
"loc_explicator_a__vox_introduction_explicator_01","Zola speaking."
"loc_explicator_a__vox_introduction_explicator_02","This is Zola."
"loc_explicator_a__vox_introduction_explicator_03","Zola here."

"loc_explicator_a__vox_introduction_explicator_05","Zola connected."
"loc_flight_control_a__mission_core_cinematic_a_01","Due to compromised flightpath visibility all military activities are suspended till sun up."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot04_01","I am Iven Rannick, Interrogator to Inquisitor Grendyl."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot04_02","Sensoria reports in the last twelve hours have uncovered unauthorized communication broadcasts aboard the ship."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot04_03","Someone onboard the Mourningstar is relaying information to the surface. To the enemy. There is a traitor among us."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot04_04","Everyone is a suspect."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot04_05","I suggest you raise your game and make a conspicuous effort to prove yourself. Starting now."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_01","Acolytes. You’ve both done well."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_02","My senior staff evaluate the two of you as commendable. You’ve earned a special reward. A formal place in the warband..."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_03","...for one of you. For the other, the unforgiving wrath of the Inquisition."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_04","The traitor has at last been identified."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_05","Did you think you could hide your true nature from me?"
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_06","Hmm..."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_07","Of you, acolyte, I have no more doubts. You’ve served me well. And you will continue to do so."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_08","Welcome to the warband. Welcome to the Inquisition."
"loc_interrogator_a__cs_pot09_09","Get the maintenance servitor in here before it starts to smell will you Sergeant Major."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_abandoned_a_01","A lamentable waste. Perhaps we should station a garrison here?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_abandoned_a_02","I don't care what anyone else says: there's something inexpressibly orderly about abandonment."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_abandoned_a_03","I'd keep moving team ... unless you want to become part of the decor."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_b_01","Assuming that the cursed machine still works ..."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_b_02","Don't speak too soon. We have an almost unparalleled aptitude for failure."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_b_03","Better not to presume without proof."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_a_01","As you may know, the rituals to create Moebian Steel were lost long ago ... everything else is propaganda."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_a_02","The Moebian Steel of today is not the famed formulation of old. The secret has been lost for ... some time."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_a_03","Moebian Steel is not, alas, all it was ... but the same can be said of any of us, can it not?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_b_01","Yet a facility in the inter-zone void may yet hold the key to restoration ... assuming our contact can be trusted."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_b_02","We have a contact who swears blind - and floridly - that an inter-zone foundryplex can change all that."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_b_03","Our contact claims that all that was old shall be new again ... courtesy of an inter-zone foundryplex."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_c_01","Do mind your step down there. The perils of the void notwithstanding, I'm not entirely certain we can trust our contact."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_c_02","This mission will not be without its risks. But I'm certain you'll cope. And if you can't? ... There are others."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_briefing_c_03","You may think this to be merely another unattractive suicide mission ... but as you've no choice but to go, that hardly matters does it?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_dead_machine_02_a_01","Such a waste of potential. Our forebears really should have taken better care of things."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_dead_machine_02_a_02","Look at this place. The Imperium is more ruin than relevance these days."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_dead_machine_02_a_03","Such a mess. I can almost hear Hadron weeping those strange metallic tears of hers."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_04_a_01","I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing ever works as it should on Atoma."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_04_c_01","And more with every passing hour."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_05_b_01","I wouldn't tempt fate."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_06_a_01","I can't help thinking that I should have led this mission in person."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_06_c_01","You really DO know Grendyl."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_01_b_01","And why is that?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_02_b_01","Such confidence. I am breathless with anticipation."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_03_b_01","Or else the entire facility will explode, is that it?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_blown_a_01","It would seem that you'll have to start again ..."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_blown_a_02","Start again team ... and can I trouble you for some competence?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_blown_a_03","You'll have to start again ... but I'm sure you know that."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_a_01","This would appear to be an activator ..."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_a_02","I believe I see an activator ..."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_a_03","That activator should rouse the machine."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_complete_a_01","Yes. Most acceptable. I think you should be able to reach the sacrarium by now."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_complete_a_02","Ah, industry. Time we were moving on to the Sacrarium Mechanicus."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_complete_a_03","That seems to be in order. Strike Team, kindly move on to the sacrarium."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_smash_a_01","The machine's crusted up with ice? It's almost disappointing. You know what to do."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_smash_a_02","Ah, the ice is getting clingy. Strike Team? Start smashing."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_smash_a_03","Removing the ice should get things moving again."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_widget_not_working_a_01","Ah. My readings show that the error is somewhere above you. Kindly investigate."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_widget_not_working_a_02","According to my auspex readout, the error is somewhere higher up. You know what comes next."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_02_widget_not_working_a_03","I suppose it was optimistic to assume that would work. Ascend and investigate."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_03_end_a_01","Moebian Steel? It'll have to be verified of course, but this is an acceptable outcome."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_03_end_a_02","Moebian Steel? A small enough quantity, but we can certainly put it to use."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_03_end_a_03","The process appears to be concluded. I never doubted the end result, of course."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_03_start_b_01","Valour, thou shouldst be weeping at this hour."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_03_start_b_02","Moebian Steel is nothing to the value of your own skin, is that it?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_event_03_start_b_03","Courage is too expensive a commodity for you, I take it?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_objective_01_b_01","You'd be surprised how swiftly a valkyrie can travel."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_objective_01_b_02","We'd have done better to keep to the valkyrie, don't you think?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_objective_01_b_03","It seems to me that the Storm Raptor could have crossed the void already."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_objective_02_a_01","We appear to have arrived. Strike Team? You may proceed."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_objective_02_a_02","Strike Team? Stand ready. The heretics are sure to be waiting for you."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_objective_02_a_03","Strike Team? Expect resistance. I doubt the heretics will give up without a fight."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_06_a_01","I have yet to receive a suitable explanation for how you uncovered this place."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_06_c_01","Very well. How did you find this foundryplex?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_07_a_01","It looks positively frosty down there. You're making ME cold."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_07_c_01","And if you don't?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_08_a_01","It concerns me that the Moebian 6th have found this supposedly hidden facility."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_08_c_01","Nothing stays hidden forever. Not even the deepest of secrets."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_b_01","Yes, yes, yes ... do you suppose we might proceed?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_b_02","Perhaps we could save these theatrics for later?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_b_03","Oh look, an attention seeking scoundrel. Apparently we have no shortage of those."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_d_01","Yes ... Well ... We need not speak of Grendyl in front of the operatives."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_d_02","This is hardly the time to discuss what Grendyl may or may not have said."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_d_03","I'm sure these operatives find all this talk of Grendyl rather dull."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_01_a_01","Is the foundryplex secure?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_01_c_01","[Sigh]"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_02_a_01","I analysed your message thoroughly. Would you care to explain the hidden carrier frequency."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_02_c_01","Yes. Most convincing."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_03_b_01","We are not here to sightsee."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_void_vista_a_01","I'm sure Hadron finds this beautiful, but to me it's just another grey box."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_void_vista_a_02","It's not much to look at, is it? But this place could tip the balance of the war."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_core_void_vista_a_03","Strike Team? I would be mindful of your footing. It's a very long way down."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_city_view_a_01","So quiet. So calm. One could be forgiven for not knowing there was a war on."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_city_view_a_02","It looks so ... tranquil. But heresy hides beneath."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_city_view_a_03","Ah. Such a charming locale. I'm sure nothing untoward lies in wait."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_closer_b_01","I'm sure you see something I don't."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_closer_b_02","And exactly how have you reached that conclusion?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_closer_b_03","Is that so? I'm afraid I don't see it."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_closer_d_01","Ah. Armageddon intuition. Where would we be without it?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_closer_d_02","Splendid. Consider me entirely reassured."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_closer_d_03","Not a basis on which to found strategy ... but carry on I suppose."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_a_01","It seems I wasn't imagining that vox stutter after all ..."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_a_02","So the traitors can disrupt our vox communications? That isn't exactly ideal."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_a_03","So our vox channels prove themselves less than sacrosanct? Interesting."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_c_01","Yes ... As ever, the Emperor Protects."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_c_02","Still, it is concerning. I will speak to Hadron. She might even listen."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_c_03","Any breach of the voxnet is cause for concern. I shall investigate most ... thoroughly."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_01","I'm reading instability in the vox signal. Traitor interference or a natural phenomena?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_02","That's curious ... the vox signal is showing disruption."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_03","Sergeant-major, are you seeing this vox stutter? ... Never mind, it appears to have resolved."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_b_01","I stand before you chastened, sergeant-major."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_b_02","Please accept my fulsome apologies."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_b_03","Remarkable. And to think I doubted you."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_a_01","More security measures? We must be on the right path."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_a_02","Another obstacle. The path of the faithful is strewn with such."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_a_03","I don't think the heretics want you going any further."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_b_01","We never doubted that we'd have our work cut out for us."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_b_02","Yes, the roots of treachery go deep and feed well."

"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_c_01","Still ... I suppose they've survived this long. Who knows ... ?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_c_02","At least they're easily replaceable."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_c_03","I thought these were some of our best operatives. Your sentimental side is showing, sergeant-major."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_a_01","Your team appear to have made quite the mess, sergeant-major."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_a_02","A most thorough piece of deconstruction."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_a_03","I don't imagine the heretics will have this functional any time soon."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_b_01","Yes ... It becomes increasingly apparent that the Moebians may be a symptom, not the disease."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_b_02","It would seem that there is more rotten in Tertium than was immediately apparent."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_b_03","Conspiracy and heresy go hand in hand. Grendyl will not be happy, but nor will Grendyl be surprised."

"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_c_02","As you were, sergeant-major. I'm simply showing an interest."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_c_03","Oh, I'm just taking an interest."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_e_01","As you say. Do carry on."

"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_01_a_01","Escaped? Perhaps that is for the best. Explicator, extract your strike team."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_01_c_01","And will you have faith in their corpses? You heard her. Wolfer knows. This is a trap."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_02_b_01","They're drawing you in."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_03_a_01","Vox chatter confirms that enemy forces are converging on the strike team's location."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_03_c_01","You're not listening, Zola. I applaud initiative, of course ... but the warband cannot afford wilfulness. Grendyl will not tolerate it."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_03_e_01","You know how we have laboured to undermine Moebian morale."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_03_f_01","Everyone is expendable, yes, even this strike team ... but if they die here and now, in a trap you've blundered into?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_aftermath_03_g_01","Wolfer will crow about it from the rooftops. You'll undo weeks of work."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_arrival_01_b_01","Rinda Karnak? Eliminate her."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_arrival_02_b_01","You are not in control here, Zola. They are."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_end_a_01","Tidily accomplished. Your extraction is waiting. This is has not exactly been textbook, but be assured I am very impressed by your ability."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_end_b_01","I am certain we will speak again soon."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_01_a_01","I've warned you before about your obsession with Wolfer."

"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_a_01","The traitor voxnet is ablaze. If you are to extract your team, it must be now."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_c_01","You know how we have laboured to undermine Moebian morale."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_e_01","Know ... what?"
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_g_01","Very well. Explicator Zola, I relieve you of your responsibilities to this mission."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_02_i_01","Strike Team? Do try to stay alive. I will arrange extraction."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_03_a_01","Lieutenant Masozi, the strike team requires immediate extraction ... Yes? Yes, I see. Understood."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_03_b_01","Alternate extraction is not available. The only way out is through. But you are to take no chances. No fancywork. No prisoners."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_exchange_03_c_01","Kill anyone in your path - including the twins. Their deaths will salvage something from this ... error."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_mission_start_a_01","Explicator Zola! Kindly explain yourself."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_mission_start_c_01","Is compromised. Withdraw your team while you still can."
"loc_interrogator_a__mission_twins_mission_start_e_01","Then may the Emperor Protect them."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_a_01","Once again, I must commend you on your actions."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_b_01","Though the situation was somewhat complicated by Zola's ... zeal ... you adapted masterfully."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_c_01","You even survived ... which was unexpected."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_d_01","It is too soon to tell what lasting effect the deaths of Rinda and Rodin Karnak will have on the battle for Tertium."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_e_01","Perhaps Zola was correct, and their removal will tilt the balance in our favour. Perhaps not."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_f_01","Regardless, you have served the Inquisition well. It will not be forgotten."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_g_01","As for Zola? A certain ... excess of enthusiasm is to be expected, and forgiven."
"loc_interrogator_a__twins_epilogue_01_h_01","But it may be that she bears watching in case her unreliability is but a cloak for something ... else."

"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_04","This is not a good time. "
"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_05","I don't care for you. Move on."
"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_06","Your previous operation was acceptably average."
"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_07","Your timekeeping is lacking."
"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_08","Don't stand idle. Atoma awaits."
"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_09","I don't know what Zola sees in you."
"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_10","You're back then. How lucky for me."
"loc_mourningstar_initiate_b__hub_idle_oath_a_01","For the Emperor!"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_01","Are you certain you have clearance for this area?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_02","Another Reject? Hrn."

"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_07","I see Zola's scraping the barrel."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_08","We must be desperate."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_09","I don't have time for you."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_10","Get out of my sight."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_01","Ah. I've been hearing good things about you."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_02","Gracing us with your presence, are you?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_03","Your labours have not gone unnoticed."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_04","I've seen the reports. I am not unimpressed."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_05","Tertium owes you a debt."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_06","The Mission Terminal has something only you can handle."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_07","I'm ... almost impressed."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_08","You are serving well."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_09","What next for the Hero of Atoma?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_10","The Emperor surely blesses you."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_01","Ah. You've returned."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_02","You again. Move along."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_03","Still breathing. Some people have all the luck."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_04","This isn't a good time."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_05","I'm not interested in you."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_06","Your last operation was ... acceptable."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_07","Your punctuality needs work."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_08","Atoma awaits."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_09","What does Zola see in you?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_10","You again. Fortune smiles on me."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_a__hub_idle_oath_a_01","For the Emperor!"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_01","Begone from my sight."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_02","You shouldn't be here."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_03","Don't you have work to do?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_04","Don't make me report you."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_05","Go bother someone else."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_06","I don't want to hear it ... whatever it is."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_07","Move away ... dreg."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_08","Whatever is it, I don't want to hear it."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_09","Be insolent elsewhere, do you hear?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_10","I don't have time for your prattling."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_01","It's interesting to see how you've thrived."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_02","You seem to be made for war."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_03","Your achievements have not gone unnoticed."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_04","I confess ... you set an exemplary standard."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_05","Tertium owes you ... so I'm told."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_06","The Mission Terminal is over there ... or had you forgotten?"

"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_09","You're a hero to a lot of these rejects. Remember to act like it."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_10","The Emperor expects great things from us all. Even you."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_01","You again? "
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_02","Good morrow."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_03","I would like you to leave."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_04","Must you stand there?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_05","Keep moving. Don't look back."
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_06","Didn't I see your name on a list of failures?"
"loc_mourningstar_officer_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_07","Shouldn't you be on mission?"

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_02","Couldn't kill you, then?"

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_06","Taking a breather, are we?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_07","You're not looking so good. Tough scrape?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_08","Been a few new faces come in while you were gone."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_09","Had a bit of a quiet spell. It won't last."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_a__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_10","Oh. You're back."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_a__hub_idle_oath_01_b_01","For the Emperor!"

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_02","Something stinks around here."

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_01","Good day."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_02","I've nothing to report."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_03","Thought you'd be dead by now."

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_08","There's always more work needs doing."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_09","Shouldn't you be doing something?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_10","Better stay alert. Zola's in a bad mood."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_b__hub_idle_oath_01_b_01","For the Emperor!"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_01","You don't have clearance. Move on."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_02","This isn't for the likes of you."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_03","Keep right on walking, Reject."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_04","Step back. Right now."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_05","What? What do you want?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_06","None of this is your concern. "
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_07","Zola's done scraping the barrel. We're onto dregs."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_08","Are we *truly* that desperate?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_09","Move along. I'm busy."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_10","I can still see you. Get out of here."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_01","I've been hearing good things about the work you're doing."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_02","Choosing to grace us with your presence?"

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_06","Head to the Mission Terminal. There's a task only you can handle."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_07","I could say I was impressed, but I don't want to get your hopes up."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_08","You're serving well enough."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_09","Ah, the Hero of Atoma! What comes next for you, then?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_10","The Emperor is watching over you, it seems."

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_03","You're either capable or lucky. Reckon it's the latter."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_04","Now is not a good time."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_05","Perhaps later, Reject."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_06","By all accounts, your last operation wasn't a complete failure."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_07","Throne, your timekeeping needs work."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_08","Move on, Reject. Atoma waits for you!"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_09","What, exactly, does Zola see in you?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_greeting_neutral_a_10","Praise be to the Emperor. You're back."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_c__hub_idle_oath_a_01","For the Emperor!"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_01","Keep moving."

"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_08","What's your damage?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_09","You looking for trouble?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_dislike_a_10","I am not your friend."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_01","Can't believe those Moebians. Traitor scum."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_02","I've heard things about you. Good things."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_03","You're pulling your weight. Good to see."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_04","You're a proper soldier. Proud of you."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_05","Tertium owes you. Owes us both."
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_06","Never a dull moment, right?"
"loc_mourningstar_soldier_male_d__hub_idle_greeting_like_a_07","No rest for the righteous, yes?"

"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_end_03","You have the cypher-ident? Good. Head down through the hangars."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_end_04","You have the Vault cypher-ident. Then it is time to get moving."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_01","Yeah. This place has seen better days. Get the cypher-ident before the lot packs up."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_02","Not much to look at, is it? See if you can find that cypher-ident."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_03","It is not pretty, but it doesn't need to be. Get the cypher-ident so we can get this done."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_hacking_event_start_04","So far, so good. Let us hope that these servitors have the cypher-ident."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_end_01","This is probably redundant, but get yourself out of there. Now!"
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_end_02","You've got the samples. Now get back."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_end_03","Samples acquired. Time to run for it!"
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_end_04","Get out of there! You've got what you came for, now leave."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_01","You know what to do. Open the cells and grab the contagion samples."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_02","Get those cells open and find the contagion canisters. If they are oozing, do not lick them!"
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_03","The contagion canisters are somewhere in these cells. Open them up! … The cells, not the canisters."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_luggable_event_start_04","Time to open the cells. Sooner you find those canisters, the sooner you can leave."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_01","Look for a switch to access the Excise Vault."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_02","Good. You are at the Excise Vault. Get it open."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_03","Excise Vault is up ahead. Find a way inside."
"loc_pilot_a__cmd_mission_scavenge_vault_access_04","There will be a switch to open the Excise Vault."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_02_01","It is not going to happen. You are to lucky have me."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_02_02","Do not be so gloomy. Think of the challenge!"
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_02_03","Do not worry. It will all be fine. And if it is not, we will already be dead."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","Sounds like you welcome it."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Funny thing to relish."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","Praise the Emperor in all things."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","May he send me clear skies, a sturdy Valkyrie ... and blind skyfire gunners."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Can't you talk normally? Something about you should be normal."
"loc_pilot_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","You know that language can be a barrier to communication, right?"
"loc_pilot_a__cs_pot06_01","What do you want? I didn’t call for crew support... unless you know how to re-thread a torque servo."
"loc_pilot_a__cs_pot06_02","You know, I’ve seen so many of you come and go I can hardly keep track."
"loc_pilot_a__cs_pot06_03","Let me give you a tip. You want to make your mark here, prove yourself. Work hard."
"loc_pilot_a__cs_pot06_04","Demonstrate how essential you are to the big man. That’s how you win trust."
"loc_pilot_a__cs_pot06_05","Now get lost. Come back when you’ve survived a few more missions, and if I know your name by then, you’ll know you’re doing something right."

"loc_pilot_a__cs_prologue_four_02_01","Stand by, Zola. The guidance is out. I need a minute to recalibrate."
"loc_pilot_a__eavesdropping_01","I heard every word of that."
"loc_pilot_a__eavesdropping_02","If you think I'm not listening, I've got a surprise for you."
"loc_pilot_a__eavesdropping_03","I can hear you..."
"loc_pilot_a__eavesdropping_04","Still connected. Just so you know."
"loc_pilot_a__eavesdropping_05","I can hear every word you're saying."
"loc_pilot_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_01","That's horrible. Kill the others!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_02","That's one. You can bet it has plenty of siblings."
"loc_pilot_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_03","That's one. Kill the rest!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_04","Kill the rest. No need to stand on ceremony."

"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_01","One last step - you need to open that Blast Gate!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_02","Now all you need do is open that Blast Gate!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_03","Now get that Blast Gate open, and we'll call it done!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_04","Last job is to get that Blast Gate open!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_01","Nice work! Now deploy a landing beacon. Wouldn't want us to go to the wrong place, would you?"
"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_02","That did it! Now we need a landing beacon. You can manage that, can't you?"
"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_03","Okay. Now we need a landing beacon in place."
"loc_pilot_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_04","We are getting somewhere. Get a landing beacon deployed ... unless you want to be alone?"

"loc_pilot_a__event_kill_target_destroyed_b_02","I'm impressed. And I don't get impressed that easily."
"loc_pilot_a__event_kill_target_destroyed_b_03","A good victory. Remember this one. It's worth it."
"loc_pilot_a__event_kill_target_destroyed_b_04","I confess, I wasn't sure you'd manage it."
"loc_pilot_a__event_kill_target_heavy_damage_b_01","Just a little more!"

"loc_pilot_a__event_scan_skull_waiting_02","Stop faffing about! Empty your auspexes to the Servo-Skull!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_scan_skull_waiting_03","Come on! The Servo-Skull is waiting for that data!"
"loc_pilot_a__event_scan_skull_waiting_04","The skull can't uplink with your auspex from that distance! Get close and upload it!"
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_01","Storm Raptor is ready to depart. Just waiting on a strike team."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_02","Skies are thick with fire. Going to take some smooth flying to get you down there."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_03","What is the delay? Storm Raptor is fuelled and ready to go."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_04","Wind is picking up down there. Might be some chop."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_05","I cannot promise a smooth ride, but I will get you there in one piece."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_06","I hope you have a strong stomach ... It is going to be a rough ride."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_07","Ready for some action? I know just the spot."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_08","Ready to go? You just give me the word."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_09","Do not worry. I have not been shot down for ... oh ... days now."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_10","When you fly with Lieutenant Masozi, you are flying with style."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_11","Get your strike team together, and let's move. Rannick is getting impatient."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_12","Gather your strike team. There is a war to win!"
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_13","I will get you down in one piece ... probably."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_14","You fly with me, you do not touch the controls. Not ever."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_15","My Valkyrie, my rules. Don't like that, you can stay here."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_eleven_a_01","Lady Alice, did you manage to get hold of--?"
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_forty_one_a_01","Oi, Clanky! Have you been messing with my Storm Raptor again? Something doesn't feel right."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_fortytwo_b_01","If the Omnissiah kept Storm Raptor flying, I wouldn't need to, would I?"
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirteen_a_01","Lot of auspex-stealthed shuttles out there, Lady Alice. Your doing?"
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twelve_a_01","Lady Alice, I need a favour ... Storm Raptor's blown an ionic compensator, and Clanky's refusing to fix it."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_fifteen_b_01","Really? Must have got misplaced. I will work on it right away."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_five_b_01","Understood. Nothing keeps that man happy."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_four_b_01","Really? I will have a word with him myself."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_fourteen_b_01","I will surely do that, have no fear."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_one_b_01","Smooth flying all the way. Should be touching down on the Mourningstar within the hour."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_sixteen_a_01","Picked up an unwelcome tail on that last drop, explicator. You know who."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_thirteen_b_01","Slow. Too much thinking getting in the way of their instincts."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_three_b_01","Traitors cracked our vox scrambler. Knew every move we were about to make."
"loc_pilot_a__hub_idle_conversation_two_b_01","Always am. Just give the word."
"loc_pilot_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_01","Seeing a lot of Chaos Hounds down there. Don't get separated!"
"loc_pilot_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_02","I'm seeing plenty of heretic hunting parties down there. I'm thinking you'll be fighting a lot of Chaos Hounds."
"loc_pilot_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_03","Now ... someone did tell you there's a whole pack of Pox Hounds down there, right?"
"loc_pilot_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_04","Did one of you ask for a lot of Pox Hounds? Because if so, you're in luck!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_01","Beginning air strike. Hold on to your hats!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_02","Storm Raptor beginning attack run!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_03","Never fear, Masozi is here! Woo-hoo!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_04","Beginning attack run!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_05","Supporting fire inbound!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_06","Strafing the target!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_07","Hello heretics, I have a present for you."
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_08","Let me see. Where should I put these missiles?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_09","Air strike underway!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_air_strike_a_10","I am here to save you! As always!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_all_players_required_01","You lot really need to group up. Get on that."
"loc_pilot_a__info_all_players_required_02","Group up!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_all_players_required_03","Group together. It's the best option."
"loc_pilot_a__info_all_players_required_04","Time to get cosy with each other - group up!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_all_players_required_05","You need to group up."
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_01","Security lock... fixed. You should be able to get that door now."
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_02","Door accessible. I know, I'm good, right?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_03","Override achieved. Door's all yours."
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_04","Security clearance granted. Open her up!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_05","Pressure door is not a problem. Security clearance is all yours."
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_pressure_01","Pressure door clearance granted. Move in."
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_pressure_02","We're green to go. Open up the pressure door."
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_pressure_03","We're clear! Security access granted. Get through that door now!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_pressure_04","Updating... updating... c'mon, security access... done! Pressure door open!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_bypass_pressure_05","Pressure door clearance granted. Get out of there now."
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_abyss_01","You take a tumble here, you will be dead before you hit bottom."
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_abyss_02","Be careful near the edge. I am good, but even I cannot catch you on the way down."
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_abyss_03","Watch your step near the edge. You fall on someone from three clicks up it will ruin both your days."
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_abyss_04","It is even further down than it looks, trust me."
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_abyss_05","Be careful at the edge. That first step is a killer."
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_extraction_response_01","Acknowledged."
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_extraction_response_02","Already in motion boss!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_extraction_response_03","Since you asked so nicely!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_extraction_response_05","Coming to the rescue!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_call_extraction_response_06","I hear you boss!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_almost_done_01","You are almost there."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_almost_done_02","It is almost done."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_almost_done_03","Not long now. Try not to die."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_almost_done_04","It is nearly done."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_almost_done_05","Almost! Just a little more."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_demolition_corruptors_almost_done_01","Just a few more to kill."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_demolition_corruptors_almost_done_02","You've killed plenty. It must smell horrible in there."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_demolition_corruptors_almost_done_03","Hunt the rest down and this will end."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_demolition_corruptors_almost_done_04","Kill what's left. Don't drag this out."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_one_down_01","That is one!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_one_down_02","One!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_one_down_03","First step looks strong."
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_one_down_04","A good start!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_event_one_down_05","We are underway!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_01","Extraction inbound! Move yourselves!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_02","Storm Raptor coming in for extraction!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_03","I see you! Making final approach!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_04","Storm Raptor to the rescue! Yee-ha!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_05","Hold on! Rescue inbound!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_06","I bet you are glad to see me!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_07","About time! I did not think you would make it!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_08","Yeeeee Haaaaa!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_09","Everyone can relax. I am here."
"loc_pilot_a__info_extraction_10","I am here. Save the applause for later."
"loc_pilot_a__info_first_bypass_01","Huh. Door's sealed. Don't stress it, I'll upgrade your crypt-key."
"loc_pilot_a__info_first_bypass_02","Your crypt-key doesn't have access to get through. Hold five, I'll fix that."
"loc_pilot_a__info_first_bypass_03","The door might be sealed, your crypt-key might not have access... but I'll change both of those for you."
"loc_pilot_a__info_first_bypass_04","Door's sealed. Give me a sec, I'll elevate your crypt-key access. Nothing stops us, right?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_first_bypass_05","Hmmm. Sealed door? Check. Wrong crypt-key access? Check. I got this. Hold five."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_01","Good job! I almost felt proud for a moment. Time to come home."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_02","Mission is done. Get yourselves out of there."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_03","Mission complete. See how easy that was?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_04","Look at you, completing a mission. Now you can leave."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_05","And you are done. Make your way to extraction."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_06","And now you are done. All that is left to do, is leave."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_07","The mission is complete. You are free to make your escape."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_08","That is the mission done with. Time to come home."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_09","Well done. Get out, and I will buy you a drink on the Mourningstar."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_10","Bravo! Now get of there, while you can."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_simple_01","Good job. I'll come pick you up."
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_simple_02","Nicely done. I'll be your ride home!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_get_out_simple_04","Here I come. Did you miss me?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_01","Reading a data stream …"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_02","Data stream is looking good …"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_03","Data interrogation looking good …"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_04","Come on, come on! Can this not go faster?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_01","You are almost finished."
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_02","Not long now …"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_03","It is almost done …"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_04","Not long. Just a little more …"
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_01","Interrogator has done its job."
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_02","You are done with this one."
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_03","There is nothing more to be learned from that."
"loc_pilot_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_04","You have everything it can give you."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_01","Lots of fine aerocraft in here. Hangar Delta-175's somewhere below you."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_02","Wish we could recover some of these aerocraft. Head down, and you'll reach Hangar Delta-175."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_03","Poor beauties, going to rot. Hangar Delta-175's somewhere below you."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_one_04","Waste of fine aerocraft, if you ask me. You need to head downwards to reach Hangar Delta-175."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_01","You are making good time. The Excise Vault is not far."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_02","Almost to the Excise Vault. Try not to die so close to your goal."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_03","The Excise Vault is not far now."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_hangar_guidance_two_04","Almost at the Excise Vault. You can do this."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_01","The cargo elevator is in line with the wrong floor. Let us hope it still moves."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_02","You will need to set the cargo elevator to the proper floor in order to proceed."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_03","You cannot access the servitor colony yet. Realign the cargo elevator before heading on."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_vista_04","Realign the cargo elevator before heading out. That is, if you want to access the servitor colony."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_first_objective_01","Looking good from up here. You should have a relatively clear path to the marketplace and your access point."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_first_objective_02","Your splice point's in the marketplace. Get there before the enemy wise up."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_first_objective_03","Marketplace looks clear for now. Get over there and splice into the auto-scheduler."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_first_objective_04","Time to move. Head for the marketplace - you can splice into the auto-scheduler from there."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_second_objective_01","The Sanction Redactus Target's life is over, and he has no idea. Better hurry - you wouldn't want to be late."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_second_objective_02","You'd better get to Chasm Terminus and set up your ambush."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_second_objective_03","Chasm Terminus isn't far. You'd better get there before the target."
"loc_pilot_a__info_mission_station_second_objective_04","Well, aren't you going to welcome your guest? Get to Chasm Terminus!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_batch_done_01","Good news? Plague traces confirmed. Bad news? Not what we need. Move to next block."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_batch_done_02","Hate to break it to you, but this isn't what we need. Might find it in the next block."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_batch_done_03","These plague traces are too old to be the new strain. Head to the next block."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_batch_done_04","Yep... yep... Damn! Nope. Wrong strain. We're gonna have to move to the next hab block and check there."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_batch_done_05","Checking... checking... aww, no. This is the wrong strain. Next block might have what we need."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_completed_01","Scanned. Not what we need. Next!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_completed_02","Checking readings... yeah, this isn't it. Keep searching."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_completed_03","Scan complete. Damn... Not what we need."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_completed_04","It's a good scan, but isn't what we're looking for. Keep going."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_target_located_01","Well, what do we have here?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_target_located_02","She's found something to scan. Get her into range."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_target_located_03","Likely scanning target ahead. Keep moving."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_target_located_04","Target up ahead. Let's sneak in there."
"loc_pilot_a__info_scan_target_located_05","This looks ideal. Closer... closer..."
"loc_pilot_a__info_servo_skull_deployed_01","Right. Servo-skull deployed. Let's see what she can see."
"loc_pilot_a__info_servo_skull_deployed_02","Getting readings back from the servo-skull. Good girl! Uh - her. Not you."
"loc_pilot_a__info_servo_skull_deployed_03","Servo-skull deployed. So far, so good."
"loc_pilot_a__info_servo_skull_deployed_04","Starting sweep. Stay focused."
"loc_pilot_a__info_servo_skull_deployed_05","She's doing what she's supposed to - keep an eye on those auspexes."

"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_03","Hot evac zone! We cannot stay here!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_04","What? Are you waiting for an invitation?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_05","Your chariot awaits ... but it is not waiting long!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_06","Move it! You trying to get us all killed?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_07","My, you are popular today!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_08","This whole place is in uproar. Looks like a good night's work!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_09","Having fun, are we? Taking it slow?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_10","Get yourselves inside! I am not waiting!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_11","We cannot stay here!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_12","Get aboard, before we are overrun!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_13","Get your carcasses on board!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_14","I am here! Now hurry!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_15","Someone call for a Valkyrie extraction?"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_16","Are you waiting for an invitation? Get aboard!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_17","Valkyrie on site! Get moving, or I will leave you behind!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_18","Taking your time, aren't you? Hurry!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_19","Welcome aboard Masozi Pleasure Cruises. Have a nice flight!"
"loc_pilot_a__info_valkyrie_approach_20","Remember to keep all arms and legs inside the Valkyrie during take off."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_b_01","Welcome to the next Hab Block. This one's Laranax."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_b_02","Something not right about this. Hab Block Laranax, let's check you out."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_b_03","Carry on searching. Maybe Hab Block Laranax has got something to share."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_b_04","Well done, you've got to Hab Block Laranax. Let's keep moving."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_b_05","Ah, Hab Block Laranax. The same as the last one, except probably worse."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_corpse_response_01","And that's why I stay up in the skies, where they cannot get me."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_corpse_response_02","Following Rannick's orders did not do him any good, did it?"
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_corpse_response_03","Another of Rannick's. You watch yourselves down there, you hear?"
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_corpse_response_04","Another of Rannick's 'volunteers'. How long before it is your turn?"
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_entrance_01","Hab Block Dreyko. We'll make a start here."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_entrance_02","We have to start somewhere, so Hab Block Dreyko it is."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_entrance_03","This is Hab Block Dreyko. Don't admire it for too long, keep moving."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_entrance_04","This work of art is Hab Block Dreyko. Let's see what we can find."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_01","Time to get your scanning on. Head to the Transit Hub and see what you can find."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_02","There's reports of residue in Transit Hub HL-16-11. Head over there and take a look."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_03","The hab block has plague residue. You have scanners. See if you can work it out."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_04","Okay, so you need to head to the Transit Hub. I know it sounds pretty gross, but we need to check for plague residue."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_market_01","Take a look down. That's the marketplace."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_market_02","Well, that's encouraging - the marketplace is down there which means we're going the right way."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_market_03","Right down there should be the marketplace."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_market_04","This route should take you right over the marketplace."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_market_05","Right down there is the marketplace. Closed, obviously."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_01","Welcome to the quarantine zone. Not as much fun as it sounds."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_02","You're on the edges of the quarantine zone. Get in there and look for scan targets."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_03","Okay. Quarantine zone. Sensors suggest there's scan targets in there."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_04","Be careful - this is the quarantine zone. There's scan targets to be had so eyes peeled."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_roof_01","Well, at least there's a view from up here. Not much of one, I agree. But still."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_roof_02","Tread carefully up here. It's a long way down."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_roof_03","Try not to tangle yourself up and power down the whole sector."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_roof_04","This is pretty much where this block runs out. Time to move on."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_roof_05","You could say you're on the top of the world. No? Wrong time? Okay, fair.  Move on."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_01","Done. Let's get you out of there."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_02","Scanning complete. Job well done - now to get you out."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_03","You've done what you came to do - time to get back."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_04","All data received. Let's damn well get out of that dump."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_05","You've done it! Woo hoo! Now get your backsides clear."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_void_response_01","That is hive cities for you. Travel for dozens of klicks in any direction - still you will not see the sun."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_void_response_02","Got to have money or status to get a place sunside. For everyone else, this is it."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_void_response_03","It is one big razor-ant mound down here. Dark, smelly and dangerous."
"loc_pilot_a__level_hab_block_void_response_04","You want to try flying around down here. No room to manoeuvre and always on the brink of collapse."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_01","It's a good bet everyone knows you're there now. Better get moving."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_02","I think my ears are still ringing. Couldn't you have done that faster?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_03","That's better ... but your presence isn't exactly a secret."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_04","Well, you're sure to have woken everyone up now."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_a_01","Wouldn't you know? The Moebians aren't working alone. They're getting help from inside."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_a_02","For all it looks as though the Moebians are invaders, someone inside Tertium wanted them here."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_a_03","The Moebians aren't a solo act in this little uprising. Problem is, we don't know who's working with them."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_a_04","There's more to this little uprising than the Moebians. At least, so Rannick says."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_b_01","We need to find out who else is involved, so you're going to Archivum Sycorax to see what you can find."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_b_02","No heresy is without trail, and Rannick thinks you'll find on in Archivum Sycorax. "
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_b_03","Archivum Sycorax is your best chance of picking up the trail of the traitors within."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_b_04","Archivum Sycorax processes half of the data coming out of Throneside. It's a good place to look for clues."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_c_01","The servo-skull will do the hard part. Just get into the Deep Archives and follow its lead."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_c_02","The servo-skull can root out the best files to access. You'll have to do the rest."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_c_03","Once you're in the Deep Archives, set the servo-skull loose and follow its lead."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_brief_c_04","The Deep Archives should give us all that we need. Recover whatever you can for analysis."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_01","You're getting warmer. Press on through the Cogitator Hall."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_02","The Cogitator Hall's just ahead. You're almost where you need to be. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_03","You're still not through the Cogitator Hall? I lose my bet."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_04","You'd better hurry through the Cogitator Hall. You know how impatient Morrow gets."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_01","Have fun in the Deep Archives. They're a bit ... subterranean for me."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_02","I'm told the Deep Archives are quite pretty. Never seen them though."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_03","Wouldn't catch me in the Deep Archives. I get claustrophobic."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_04","The Deep Archives? Rather you than me. Try not to get buried alive."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deeper_01","Time to head further into the archivum. They're called the Deep Archives for a reason."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deeper_02","The Deep Archives are still some way off. You'd better pick up the pace."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deeper_03","You're still some distance from the Deep Archives. "
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_deeper_04","Are you planning on reaching the Deep Archives today? You wouldn't know it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_end_event_complete_01","Job's done, and faster than I expected. Time to come on home."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_end_event_complete_03","Data haul looks good. You can get to extraction."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_end_event_complete_04","Data salvage is ... yes, complete! Nice work. You can leave now."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_01","This is where your search begins. If I were you, I'd let the servo-skull do the hard part."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_02","Get your servo-skull deployed ... Unless you want to go searching through all this manually?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_03","You've arrived. Get your servo-skull deployed, and let's see what you can find."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_04","I thought you'd never get here. Time for your servo-skull to take the lead."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_first_objective_01","Best speed to Archivum Sycorax!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_first_objective_02","You just keep heading to Archivum Sycorax. We'll discuss the rest when you're there."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_first_objective_03","Keep moving. The Archivum isn't far."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_first_objective_04","First step's reaching the Archivum. We'll see what happens afterwards."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_01","There is a way in through maintenance."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_02","Trust in Masozi! I'm looking right at the maintenance entrance, and it's still open!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_03","You can get in through maintenance. It'll work out just fine."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_04","I already thought of that. You should go in through maintenance instead."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_b_01","Just try not to break anything you don't have to."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_b_02","Try not to destroy anything. Once the records are gone, they cannot be replaced."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_b_03","Everything has value to someone, and we need this place kept intact."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_b_04","Just watch where you're shooting. Don't want a decade of history forgotten because you can't aim."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_b_01","Traitors cross all strata of wealth and status. Nowhere is immune."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_b_02","No one is above suspicion. Not the lowliest worker nor the governor himself."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_b_03","Traitors hail from all walks of society. Selfishness is a universal failing."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_b_04","There is never a shortage of heretics. And the more you look, the more you find."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_b_01","Like most of the Imperium, Archivum Sycorax is surprisingly durable."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_b_02","That's the Imperium for you. Built to last, and to endure."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_b_03","Praise the Emperor, but this place will be here - and functioning - long after we're all dead."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_b_04","We build things to last and servitors to keep them running. It's part of what makes us strong."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_01","You've got to learn to enjoy the variety of life. It can't all be sunshine and flowers."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_02","It could be worse. I could be down there with you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_03","Oh hush. I'm working on a good mood, and I don't need you spoiling it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_04","Rannick said you'd say that. And then he laughed. A big, belly laugh."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_01","You'll have to override the ventilation substack gates to access the main building ... but it's bound to trigger an alarm."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_02","Override the ventilation substacks gates to go deeper. But beware the alarm ..."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_03","Overriding the ventilation substack gates will get you into the main building. It will also trigger an alarm."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_04","The good news? Overriding the ventilation substack gates will get you deeper inside. The bad news? It's all alarmed."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_01","Normally you wouldn't be able to get through here - too many queuing scribes."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_02","Archivum scribes spend most of their day simply queuing to get in. The Heretics have solved that problem!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_03","Vault Walk is a scribes' thoroughfare. I doubt there are any here today though."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_04","The scribes normally queue for hours along this road. Rather them than me."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_01","Power restored. Let's hope it's still functional."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_02","The power's flowing. Now we'll see."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_03","Power levels look good. Standby ... and don't get killed."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_01","Rannick says the Blight has undergone another evolution - whatever that means."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_02","I don't know everything, but apparently the Blight is getting worse."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_03","Rannick said to tell you that the Blight is causing mischief again. Hungrier than ever, it is."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_04","Here is what I know: We have a new wave of infections from the Blight."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_01","Watch your backs. Plague aside, I hear the district is not as clear as they are saying."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_02","Rannick claims they are trying to make a cure ... but you never know what is really going on."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_03","Keep your heads down. You are not the first team I have ferried in for a mission like this."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_04","Just remember, if things go wrong ... ? Well, I will be close by. Ace's Luck to you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_01","I will put you down in Transit Hub HL-16-11 where you can scan plague residue for anything new."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_02","They think Transit Hub HL-16-11 is the source. You will be scanning plague residue for a new strain."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_03","They've narrowed the source to Transit Hub HL-16-11. You can scan plague residue for signs of an evolved strain."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_04","I hear Transit Hub HL-16-11's likely the source. You will need to scan plague residue for the new strain. See if it's true."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_a_01","There's a comms-plex dish on top of Archivum Sycorax. You know, the big building in Throneside?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_a_02","You're going back into Throneside to take control of Archivum Sycorax's comms-plex dish."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_a_03","Archivum Sycorax has a very large comms-plex dish, and you know we like to work on a grand scale."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_a_04","Your target is Archivum Sycorax's comms-plex dish. Don't worry, you're not being asked to destroy it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_b_01","You're to seize it and transmit an encrypted message out to a mid-system listening station."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_b_02","You're capture the dish, then use it to transmit an encrypted message out to one of Grendyl's listening stations."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_b_03","It's up to you to capture the dish, then transmit an encrypted message to a mid-system listening post."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_b_04","Your orders are to capture the dish, then transmit some kind of encrypted message to a hidden listening post."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_c_01","Don't ask me why. I've learned that certain questions only bring trouble around here."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_c_02","If you're confused? Don't worry, so am I. Doesn't mean we can't get it done."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_c_03","Even for our day to day, this is a bit unusual. But you know the price of failure. "
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_brief_c_04","Don't ask me questions, because I don't have any solid answers for you. Just get it done."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_01","If I were you, I'd look for an elevator."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_02","You'll need an elevator next. Let's hope something's still working."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_03","See if you can find an elevator. It'll be quicker than walking."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_04","Look out for an elevator. The comms-plex dish in on the roof."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_b_01","You didn't hear it from me, but I think they're worried there's a spy aboard ship. This way is cleaner."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_b_02","I've heard rumours of a traitor aboard ship. For now, this is the preferable option."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_b_03","There's a trust issue aboard the Mourningstar at the moment ... That's all I can say."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_b_04","I've heard that not everyone aboard ship is as loyal as they seem. You're a safer option."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_b_01","There's an auspex-stealthed outpost responsible for relaying information to Grendyl's other operatives. I can't tell you more."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_b_02","If I told you, I'd have to kill you. Then someone would probably kill me. I wouldn't like that."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_b_03","Another of Grendyl's operatives. We're only a part of his organisation."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_b_04","Grendyl has operatives everywhere. Atoma isn't his only concern."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_b_01","I imagine it's battle zone updates. Condition reports. That sort of thing."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_b_02","It's warzone data. The who, what, why and how much that keeps a war moving. Grendyl can't afford to rely on outsiders' estimates."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_b_03","It's status updates for this warzone, I'd imagine. Knowledge is power, especially when the bullets are flying."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_b_04","I hear it's campaign intel. You know, requisition levels, readiness reports ... that sort of thing."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_01","Elevator's here! Get out of there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_02","Elevator's arrived. What are you waiting for?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_03","Elevator's here. Looks like you live to fight another day."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_04","That's the elevator and you're still alive. I lose my bet, but I forgive you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_first_objective_01","You're currently in the wrong enclavum. You'll need to cross the Skylink."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_first_objective_02","There's a Skylink bridge nearby. Use it to reach the next enclavum."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_first_objective_03","This isn't the right enclavum. Make for the Skylink."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_first_objective_04","You need to cross to a neighbouring enclavum. You'll be looking for the Skylink."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_01","Lots of heroes remembered here. Maybe you'll join them one day?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_02","The Imperium remembers its heroes when it forgets so much else."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_03","This is a plaza of heroes. History remembers those who serve ... and have good contacts."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_04","Look at all these stern faces. Heroes never smile ... or so history would have you believe."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_01","See? It's going well. You'll be at Archivum Sycorax in no time."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_02","You're making good time. Try to cheer up!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_03","And you thought this would be difficult. You're almost at the archivum already."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_04","After all that complaining you're almost there. Doesn't always have to be hard."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_01","Recon shows the main gate's out of service. Look for another way in."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_02","Main gate's no help to you. I know ... that never happens."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_03","Would you believe the main gate's sealed? You'll have to improvise."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_04","No way you're getting in through the main gate. Have fun finding another path!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_01","Kill that breaker. It feeds power to the skyfire on the roof."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_02","Unless you want to walk home, reset that breaker. It should short out the skyfire."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_03","There's a lot of skyfire up top. Reset the breaker to shut it down."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_04","Won't be able to extract you until the skyfire's out, so reset that breaker."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_01","You're all cheery today ..."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_02","Oh, it could be worse. It can always be worse."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_03","It's a courageous sort who complains around here. How brave are you feeling?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_04","Try to make the best of it. I'm sure you'll be fine."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_01","Final stretch. Find a way onto the roof. If you're lucky, I'll wave to you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_02","The roof's still a little further. Aren't you glad you didn't take the stairs?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_03","Now all you need do is reach the roof."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_04","You're almost to the roof. One last effort!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_01","You did it! Time to send that message on its way!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_02","Dish is ... Yes, looking good! Punch it and let's get you out of there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_03","That's it! Hit the button to get the message sent!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_04","Dish aligned! Now all that's left is to send the transmission!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmitter_01","There's transmitter. You'll need to align it with your data-interrogators!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmitter_02","You can align the dish using your data-interrogators."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmitter_03","Time to align the transmitter. Get your data-interrogators working!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_complex_transmitter_04","The dish isn't aligned, but we can fix that. Or rather you can. Time for your data-interrogators!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_02","A Comms-Plex has fallen into enemy hands and it's putting out a real strange broadcast."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_03","A Comms-Plex is putting out a heretic broadcast. That isn't good, just so you know."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_04","The heretics have taken over a Comms-Plex. Right now, they're beaming out propaganda."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_05","The Heretics took a Comms-Plex and they're broadcasting something nasty."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_01","Crawls right down into the brain and corrupts you from within. Bad stuff."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_02","Walks the line between tech and magic. Gets right in your head and turns you against the Emperor."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_03","There's something strange in with the ranting. Like maggots crawling through the mind."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_04","It's no ordinary signal. Rammed full of psychic suggestion... or that's what I heard."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_01","I'll drop you nearby. Get in and stop that signal. Don't waste any time."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_02","You need to shut it down. I'll set you down in the next district. You can fight your way in from there."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_03","Shut it down, any way you can. Try to have a little fun while you're doing it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_04","Shut it down, in the Emperor's name. Unbelief is more dangerous than a chainsword."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_01","The consulate's sealed off. Look for a release."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_02","The consulate's on lockdown. You'll need the release."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_03","It's a primitive security system. It won't keep you out."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_04","There is a door override close by."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_01","It's not as simple as throwing a switch. You need to reach the control room."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_02","All right. Now make your way to the control room."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_03","Almost there. Now find your way to the control room."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_04","You need to reach the control room. If you're not too busy."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_01","You're passing through the consulate. Don't forget to show your papers."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_02","Passing right through without showing your papers. Somewhere an official is crying."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_03","Did you bring your ID papers? ... Only joking."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_04","Nothing lasts forever. Not even bureaucracy."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_01","Destroy the daemonic growths! That should restore the bridge."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_02","Don't think the daemon wants company. Destroy the daemonic growths to realign the bridge."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_03","The daemon's not making this easy. Destroy the daemonic growths to reposition the bridge."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_04","You want to get across? Destroy the daemonic growths."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_01","Come on, kill these daemonic growths."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_02","Looks like this bridge has trouble too."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_03","The daemon has control of this bridge as well."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_04","The daemon really doesn't want you to proceed, does it? Shoot the daemonic growths!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_01","Woo-hoo! Now stop that signal!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_02","Nice work! Just got to stop the signal now!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_03","Get the signal stopped, and we can call it a win!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_04","Stop the signal! Come on, I'm getting bored!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_01","Kill the daemonic growths and we can get this finished!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_02","Kill the daemonic growths. That'll break the daemon's hold on the complex!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_03","You want to take control? Kill the daemonic growths!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_04","All right! Time to show that daemon who's the boss... It's me! Shoot the daemonic growths!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","That'd be the daemon burrowed through the complex? Did no one mention it?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","Didn't anyone mention the daemon? I hear it's a big one."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_b_03","I thought it was in the briefing: there's a daemon possessing parts of the building."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_b_04","I'm sure someone told you about the daemon..."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","The heretics' prayers summoned it. They are fools."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","It was drawn by the prayers of the faithless."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_b_03","As plague spreads across Atoma, many such things will emerge from Hel."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_b_04","Heretics draw all manner of evils. This is but the first."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","I hear it has tendrils all through the hive, but don't tell Rannick I said that."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","There are pieces of it wherever the heretics hold influence. Sorry."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_b_03","It goes where the heretics go. Some of them worship it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_b_04","No such luck. Some sectors are riddled with it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_01","The hangar ventilation system's seen better days, but it's your best onward route."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_02","You need to get into the ventilation system. Hopefully the heretics haven't blocked it off."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_03","Get to a hangar ventilation access. You can get across to the Comms-Plex from there."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_04","You can't get to the Comms-Plex directly. You need to get into the vent tunnels."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_01","You did it! In you go!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_02","Right! Into the vent tunnel!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_03","Vent tunnel's open. Time to move on."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_04","Vent's open. You're good to proceed."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_01","You'll need to power up the gate to breach the ventilation system."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_02","Power up that gate, and you can get into the ventilation system."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_03","That's the hangar vent. Power up the gate to get inside."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_04","This is it. Power up the gate and you can keep moving."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_01","That's the Comms-Plex. You're doing fine."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_02","Now the real fun begins, yes?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_03","Right, let's see about getting that signal shut down."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_04","You're here, and in one piece. That's a fine start."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","You'd be surprised. I know I was."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","I guess we'll have to see, won't we?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_b_03","I've a feeling you'll be in for a surprise."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_b_04","Nothing surprises me any longer. Working for Rannick cures you of scepticism."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","You certainly wouldn't want to make the jump without a grav-chute."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Well, if you fall off, you'd not feel the impact."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_b_03","Just stay away from the edge, yes?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_b_04","Better not to think about it. And to stay away from the edges."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Of course. I'll just fly you there instead. And be shredded by skyfire halfway there."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","Do you want to fly the Storm Raptor through those skyfire nests? No?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_b_03","Rannick's other teams haven't disabled the heretics skyfire yet."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_b_04","I'm good, but I'm not good enough to fly through that skyfire zone. Rannick's working on having it disabled."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_01","I'll stick with my rebreather, thanks."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_02","Not really my thing. Air doesn't taste right unless it's full of stimms."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_03","You should probably pick up the pace. You've a long walk ahead of you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_04","You'd breathe it less if you knew what was really in it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_01","Destination sighted. Not far now!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_02","The Comms-Plex isn't far, but you've a long climb ahead of you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_03","The Comms-Plex shouldn't be far away now."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_04","You can bet there'll be plenty of heretics inside the Comms-Plex."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_view_b_01","It looks even better from up here."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_view_b_02","It's not always like this. You don't want to be here in a sandstorm."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_view_b_03","You see why I prefer the open skies?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_propaganda_view_b_04","This is nothing. The higher you go, the better it gets."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_aegis_sighted_a_01","That's the aegis station."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_aegis_sighted_a_02","You're coming up on the aegis station."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_aegis_sighted_a_03","Aegis station coming up. Now for the fun part."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_01","Keep Archivum Sycorax on your right, and you won't go far wrong."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_02","No way through the Archivum. Don't worry. The streets look clear. Mostly."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_03","Looks like the Archivum's in heretic hands. Problem for another day."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_04","The Archivum's sealed up tight. Good thing you're going around."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_01","Looks like you're clear to go!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_02","And the bridge is down! I knew you could do it!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_03","Skylink's down! Time to get moving!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_04","There you go! The bridge is down!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_01","Nice work! Now all you have to do is cross the Bridge of Many Martyrs."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_02","The Aegis Station's just beyond the Bridge of Many Martyrs. Almost there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_03","One last push! Cross the Bridge of Many Martyrs and you're home free!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_04","I see you down there! Get across the Bridge of Many Martyrs and you're at the station."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_01","Look's like the Skylink's raised. You'll have get it lowered."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_02","Can't get across the Skylink until you lower it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_03","Bad news! You'll have to lower the Skylink to cross."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_04","A small complication: you'll have to lower the Skylink."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_01","There are heretics all over Throneside, and Rannick is rather less than pleased."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_02","Heretic activity in Throneside has reached unacceptable levels. It's time to act."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_03","I've been seeing a lot of heretics in Throneside lately. And it's not just bored bureaucrats playing games."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_04","Heretics are everywhere in Throneside, and it's got Rannick in a less than cheery mood."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_01","I'll drop you off in Enclavum Kothar. From there, head to Enclavum Baross."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_02","Infiltration point's in Enclavum Kothar. Should be child's play to reach Enclavum Baross from there."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_03","You'll be heading for Enclavum Baross, but I'll have to put you down in a neighbouring enclavum."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_04","I'll drop you as close as I can. Once you're ""boots on ground"" head for Enclavum Baross."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_01","There's an Aegis Station over there. Clean it out and hold it until help arrives."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_02","Cleanse the Aegis Station and keep the heretics out until reinforcements arrive."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_03","The Aegis Station there is old, but once you've removed any squatters, we can use it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_04","Get the Aegis Station cleared of heretics and maybe I'll come back for you. Have fun down there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","You'll pull though. And if you don't, I'll buy a round at the wake."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Such a lot of fuss over a simple stand-and-fight mission. You're embarrassing me."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_01","Better keep up the pace. Head for the Enclavum Skylink."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_02","There's a Skylink nearby. Use it to reach Enclavum Baross."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_03","You can cross to the next Enclavum via the Skylink."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_04","You'll need to reach the Skylink to proceed, so keep running!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_01","Keep moving. I can see a lot heretics from up here."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_02","So many heretics coming for you. I guess you're popular!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_03","You've made lots of friends. You should probably keep moving."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_04","I'd pick up the pace. Lots of heretics coming your way ..."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_01","It needs power. You'd better find some power cells."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_02","Looks like a power cut. You'll need power cells."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_03","The power's out. You'll need power cells to get it working."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_04","No power. Look around for some power cells."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_01","This is why you came! Secure the Aegis Station!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_02","Hold your ground! I believe in you! ... And I've credits riding on the outcome."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_03","Time for the main event. Kill a heretic for me, would you?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_04","Looks like you're getting lots of friends! Don't let them take the station back!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_01","It's not as civilised as it looks ... but higher up the spires?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_02","This is middling territory at best. It's up in the spires it gets really pretty."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_03","Don't be so easily impressed. This is strictly middle-grade territory."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_04","Hah! You've not seen nothing yet. Wait until you go even higher up."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_01","That's Lord Militant Baross. Bit of a bigshot, so I hear."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_02","Stern fellow that Ennic Baross. Not sure I'd have liked him."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_03","See that statue? Lord Militant Baross is the patron hero of this district."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_04","Every district in Throneside is named for a great hero. That's Ennic Baross."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_statue_riga_consora_a_01","That's Militant General Riga Consora. A lady with a complicated reputation."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_statue_riga_consora_a_02","Riga Consora earned her statue, sure enough. In blood."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_statue_riga_consora_a_03","Riga Consora, Heroine of the Galatine Rift. A hard woman, by all accounts. "
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_streets_a_01","I suppose the streets are still full ... even if it is with heretics."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_streets_a_02","The heretics have really made themselves at home, haven't they?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_resurgence_streets_a_03","Those streets are crawling with heretics. Have fun!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_01","We all know that the Moebians are not working alone. They have collaborators, and collaborators do not work for free."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_02","The Moebians are not alone in this war. There are many other traitors in Tertium."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_03","The Moebians are only one threat. A loud, obvious, easily countered one. But there are others."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_01","You are to intercept a pay-off between our friends in the 6th and whoever they're working with."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_02","A pay-off is underway between the traitorous 6th and their allies of circumstance."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_03","A pay-off is imminent. And I don't think we want it to go smoothly, now do we?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_01","You are to proceed to the meeting site, seize the prismata crystals and leave both sides empty-handed. Sounds fun doesn't it?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_02","Proceed along the maintenance tracks, ambush the Moebians and seize the payment. That's it. Unless you want to escape as well."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_03","You can use the rail network to get in. Once you're there, grab those valuable prismata crystals and find your way to extraction. Have fun!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_final_01","This is it. Get scanning. About time, too!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_final_02","Well, we got there in the end. Scan time!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_final_03","I was about to give up on you, but you've found it. Great job, now scan."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_final_04","We need a good, solid scan of this. We found what we needed, now let's study it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_final_05","Get scanning. This is what we've been hunting. You did a good job."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_new_target_01","Woo! Another scan target! Move in!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_new_target_02","We're picking up another target."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_new_target_03","Another target nearby. Let's find it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_new_target_04","Okay, looks like there's another target close by."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scan_new_target_05","Don't give up - picking up another target."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_04","Up in Sector Periferus, there is a Excise Vault just full of experimental contagion. Rannick wants us - by which he means you - to steal it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_05","The Heretics have an Excise Vault full of experimental contagion up in Sector Periferus."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_06","The Heretics took over an abandoned Excise Vault some time ago. Nowadays, it's a store for their latest contagions."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_07","We are inbound to Sector Periferus. The Heretics have a store of experimental contagion in an old Excise Vault."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_01","You are not bringing that muck aboard my Storm Raptor. Use the pneumatic conveyor. Then you can leave."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_02","Use the pneumatic conveyor to get the samples out - you are not bringing them aboard my Valkyrie!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_03","There is a pneumatic conveyor in the Vault itself. That is your delivery method. After that, you can extract."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_04","I am not having heretic filth aboard my Storm Raptor. You can use the pneumatic conveyor to deliver them where they are needed."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_01","Security is tight, so you will need to extract a cypher-ident from a functional servitor colony. Then you crack the Vault."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_02","You will need a cypher-ident to access the Vault.  Wheedle that out of a nearby servitor colony."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_03","The Vault will be locked down, but a nearby servitor colony can provide today's cypher-ident … with a little encouragement."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_04","You cannot crack the Vault by force, but there is a servitor colony close by - you can brute force the cypher-idents from its data stacks."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_01","You should see it out beyond the hive skin. Skies to kill for. And I have."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_02","It's even brighter beyond the hive skin. Might even be pretty, apart from the sandstorms."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_03","We could all use a little brightness, before this world falls into shadow."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_04","It won't last. Sooner or later, night comes and misery alongside."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_two_01","Centuries. At some point, it just became easier to let it rot than organise repairs."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_two_02","Couple of centuries would be my guess. Whenever the cost of repair outweighed its usefulness."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_two_03","Probably been ruined at least a century or two. Then again, Atoma's sandstorms are fierce. Might only have been decades."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_two_04","Centuries. There will be a record somewhere. There is always a record. The trick lies in finding it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_01","To hear Rannick talk about it, the dark power that the heretics are courting derives his strength from disease."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_02","Plague is at the heart of the heretics' work. It is both offering 'to' and gift 'from' their unholy patron."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_03","The heretics' beliefs are rooted in the spread of disease. They have sickness of mind, body and soul."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_two_04","These heretics have a thing for disease. I hear rumours that it can only get worse."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_02","I have seen similar on other worlds. So many vessels you can scarcely see the sun."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_03","Atoma was always a trade capital. Where there is profit to be made, there are freighters, shuttles … smugglers."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_04","I can see its glory in my mind's eye. But I also hear the tyranny of air traffic controllers. The skies are better free."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_01","Recap. To get past Security, you gotta liberate a cypher-ident from the servitor colony. You've got this."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_02","Remember, the Vault's locked down, so grab yourself a cypher-ident from that servitor colony."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_03","Once you've got the cypher-ident, we can crack security on the Vault. Clear skies ahead, right?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_04","Get in. Get the cypher-ident. Crack security. Get into the Vault. Simple!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_a_01","We control the skies, but the Moebian 6th control the railroads. They can keep them."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_a_02","The hold the skies - for now - but the railroads are different matter."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_a_03","The railroads are vital to the heretics' plans. And to ours - at least today."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_a_04","The heretics rely on the railroads. That makes them sloppy."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_b_01","You are to redirect a train with a high-value Sanction Redactus Target to Chasm Terminus."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_b_02","Morrow says you are to redirect a train to Chasm Terminus. The passenger's your target."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_b_03","Head to the market. Splice into the auto-scheduler, and redirect the Sanction Redactus Target's train to Chasm Terminus."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_b_04","Realign the auto-scheduler and redirect the Sanction Redactus Target's train to Chasm Terminus."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_c_01","When he arrives, you can give him a nice explosive 'hello' from me."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_c_02","He's a bad man. One of the worst. Take him out and don't be gentle."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_c_03","You will be waiting for him. Don't let him leave the station alive."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_briefing_c_04","Should be easy pickings for you, if you play your cards right ..."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_01","You've got to have smarts to stay ahead of the excisemen. Not that I'd know about that ..."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_02","That's the excisement - always helping themselves to other peoples' belongings."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_03","And this is just a fraction of what gets seized. Most of it is incinerated on the spot."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_04","Let this be a lesson - never try to smuggle on a train. Do it in style instead."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_cross_station_01","The platform you want is on the other side of the station."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_cross_station_02","The Sanction Redactus Target is arriving at a platform on the station's far side."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_cross_station_03","You want to be on the other side of the station!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_cross_station_04","Cross to the far side of the station! You'll find the platform there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","You're here. Time to enjoy yourselves."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Don't play nice. Just take the heretic out any way you can."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_03","Don't get sloppy now. I've money riding on this fight."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_04","You've got this. Make Rannick proud."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Be careful. We don't know what's waiting for you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Stay on your toes. This could get messy."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_03","Stay alive. Anything else, we can fix."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_04","Time to shine like heroes!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_01","You think they tell me things like that?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_02","I wish I knew, but I don't have that intel."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_03","They just gave me a train ID. Nothing more."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_04","He could be the Arch-Arsonist of Charadon for all I know."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_enter_station_01","Keep moving. You're almost to the kill zone."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_enter_station_02","You'll have to fight your way to the platforms."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_enter_station_03","Once you're inside you're on the home stretch."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_enter_station_04","Best foot forward and get inside! Enjoy the moment!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_head_to_market_01","No way through aboveground. You'll have to use the ventilation tunnels."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_head_to_market_02","I can't see a way through on the surface, but the ventilation tunnels should serve."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_head_to_market_03","You'll have to head into the ventilation tunnels to reach the market."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_head_to_market_04","Looks like you'll have to make your way through the tunnels. Rather you than me!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_01","You've kicked the nest. Better get the splice underway!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_02","I see a lot of movement from up here! Begin your splice before you're overrun!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_03","Hurry! The sooner you finish the splice, the sooner your can leave!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_04","If I were you, I'd hurry up and start the splice. There are heretics converging on your location."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_01","It doesn't pay to say such things."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_02","You want to be careful saying that. You never know who's listening."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_03","Keep it down. You want to be the next 'guest'?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_04","It is what it is. The Emperor expects us to be strong and willing."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_01","If that's the maintenance bay, you're nearly at the station."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_02","You're in the maintenance bay? Good. Not far now!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_03","I've got a lot of movement on the station approach. You should probably hurry."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_04","Watch yourselves coming out of the maintenance bay - you're bound to draw attention."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_01","Now you see why I stick to the skies."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_02","Life of a mud-thumper. Much better to fly free."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_03","Mud-thumpers always get the worst jobs. It's all they're good for."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_04","Could be worse. At least the bombardment's stopped ... for now."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_tanks_01","The Leman Russ? It's a perfect tank for mud thumpers. Noisy and slow."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_tanks_02","You think those defences are what's keeping the enemy back? Hah, no. It's the Valkyries that do that."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_tanks_03","We should cut this bridge entirely. Pen the heretics in."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_tanks_04","You should see the bridge from up here. Or maybe you shouldn't. It's a long way down over the sides."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_01","Nice work. You upload the new schedule, and our target's as good as dead."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_02","You have access. Now redirecting that train is as simple as pushing a button."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_03","Access granted. All heretic train services are now under our control. I like it!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_04","That's the easy part done. Upload the new schedule and we can get to the hard part."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_a_05","I got word that the Heretics are using an Hourglass refinery to breed their pathogen."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_a_06","Rannick's convinced that the Heretics are brewing their pathogen at a refinery in the Hourglass."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_a_07","I've been hearing that the Heretics are using an old refinery to brew their pathogen."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_a_08","The Heretics are lurking in the Hourglass, chanting, brewing pathogens. You know, the usual."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_01","You can destroy the pathogen by building overpressure in the incubators. First you'll need to get access through flow control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_02","The pathogen doesn't take kindly to pressure, so that's how you kill it. You can get in through flow control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_03","You'll get in through flow control, then build pressure in the refinery systems to kill the goop."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_04","Flow control is the best way in. After that, you can destroy the goop by building pressure in the incubators."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_01","Rather you than me, I tell you. I've been hearing funny things about that place."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_02","Honestly? If you'd heard what I have about that place, you'd not go."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_03","Better pray the Emperor is watching over you. There's something bad about that place."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_04","Make no mistake, this is a grotty one. But trust to the Emperor and you'll come through."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_01","Getting closer. Flow Control is just across the hangar."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_02","You are almost to Flow Control. It is just across the hangar."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_03","Cross the hangar and you will be at Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_04","Not far now! Just cross the hangar."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_01","The sooner you're done, the sooner you're out."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_02","I'd hurry in there. It can only get worse."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_03","Keep calm. Get it done."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_04","You can do this. You'd better."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_01","The daemon doesn't want you leaving. Blow it a new sphincter!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_02","The daemon wants you to stay! Blow your way our of there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_03","That door's gunked up tight - use explosives!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_04","There's no shifting that door. You'll have to blow your way out of there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_01","Don't worry. That elevator won't drop you into a pit. Probably."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_02","I wouldn't trust that elevator, but you don't have a choice."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_03","Let's hope that elevator is in better shape than it looks."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_04","The elevator isn't in the best of condition, but what is around here?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_01","Get your data-interrogators set. They'll start the pressure building!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_02","Find the live incubators and set your data-interrogators going!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_03","The live incubators should be right there. Set your data-interrogators!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_04","Data-interrogators can override the pressure settings. Get them in place!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_first_objective_01","The heretics know you're here. You'd better hurry to Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_first_objective_02","I'm seeing lots of activity from up here. Watch your backs and get to Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_first_objective_03","Lots of heretic activity nearby. You'll be fighting your way to Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_first_objective_04","Flow Control isn't far, but there's plenty of heretics in the way."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_01","I'm told the pipes lead straight to Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_02","If you get lost, follow the pipes."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_03","Are you lost? You can always follow the pipes."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_04","The pipes head straight to Flow Control. Use them as your guide."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_job_done_01","Nice work! Now get out of there!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_job_done_02","That plague won't trouble Atoma any longer!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_job_done_03","You did fine work today. Unpleasant, but worthwhile."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_job_done_04","Impressive! That pathogen won't be any trouble now!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_01","You are almost there. Follow the pipes!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_02","You're heading in the right direction. Stay close to the pipes."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_03","That's it! Keeping following the pipes!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_04","The refinery isn't far. Follow the pipes!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I do not want to worry you, but something has a tight grip on Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","I'm hearing that the heretics have Flow Control locked down tight."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_a_03","I thought you might want to know ... the heretics have somehow sealed access from Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_a_04","The heretics are smart. Smart enough to lock down Flow Control, anyway. We're not sure how they did it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","There won't be any victory over the heretics until this place is wiped clean."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Can't expect to end the heretics while this stronghold of theirs endures."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_03","I told Rannick: if he wants heretics gone, we need to scour this place clean."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_04","The heretics are dug into this place. We need to shake them loose."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_01","Elevator's online. You are good to proceed."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_02","Elevator's fully functional. You can proceed."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_03","The daemon will be back, but for now the elevator's working."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_04","You only wounded the daemon, but it was enough to free the elevator."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_b_01","Honestly? That's a bit above my wage-grade. And I'm glad of it."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_b_02","Welcome to the Inquisition. Excitement around every corner."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_b_03","The Emperor fought far stranger things. The creed teaches us that much."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_b_04","You think that is insane? Wait until you've worked for Rannick as long as I have. This is nothing."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_b_01","We'll have decontamination standing by. Just worry about getting the job done."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_b_02","I wouldn't worry about it. Intel says this strain is not yet transmissible."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_b_03","If I thought you were going to carriers, would I be exfiltrating you after the mission?"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_b_04","Hush. Do not dwell on it. That way madness lies."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_b_01","It is not easily classified. It is a contagion of faith, as much as flesh."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_b_02","There is no simple description. It is curse and corruption, all mixed together."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_b_03","I cannot tell you what I do not know. Trust to prayer. Let the Emperor preserve you."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_b_04","It is no mortal contagion, or so I hear. You must have faith."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_01","That's daemon-matter and it doesn't want you to getting to its lair. Drive it out!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_02","Blessed Emperor! A daemon has manifested here! You will have to drive it out!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_03","By the Throne! A daemon has infested this place. Drive it out!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_04","Revolting. There are daemonic protuberances everywhere. You'll have to destroy them!"
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_01","Looks like you're at Flow Control."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_02","Are you at Flow Control? Good."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_03","Flow Control and still not dead? I lose my bet."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_04","Are you at Flow Control already? Rannick will be impressed."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_01","You want to be on the upper level. Find a way there."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_02","Head for the upper level. You can get to Flow Control from there."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_03","Flow Control is accessed from the hangar's upper level."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_04","You need to be on the upper level. Find a way up."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_01","It's worse beyond the atmospheric shield. Trust me on that."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_02","When the atmospheric shield collapses, the whole hive will look like this."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_03","Thank the Emperor for the atmospheric shield. It's the only thing keeping this place intact."
"loc_pilot_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_04","When that atmospheric shield finally fails it'll get a lot worse."
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_01","Oh, now that is ugly. This region's infested. Take care that you are not."
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_02","Does not look good down there. Take my advice: do not walk in the sticky stuff."
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_03","Look at that mess! Don't even think about traipsing that into my Storm Raptor!"
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_04","Reading significant infestation in your area. Best to stay clear of it if you can."
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","You see? This is why I stay up in the skies."
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","Just you be sure to wipe your boots before you get back aboard my Storm Raptor!"
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","I'd heard it was nasty down there. Better you than me!"
"loc_pilot_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","I hear the filth is mostly inert, but I wouldn't take chances."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_01","What are you still hanging around for? We've a world to save."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_02","Ready for another drop?"
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_03","Ready to fly?"
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_04","Ready to go when you are. Don't keep Rannick waiting."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_05","Hello there! How are you doing?"
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_06","Still walking and talking? Good show!"
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_07","I heard you'd copped a shot. Glad to see it's not true."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_08","Nice to see you're doing well. I'm hearing good things."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_09","Hah! I knew you were around here somewhere!"
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_10","Give me clear skies and a good aerocraft, that's all I ask!"
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_11","Storm Raptor's running rough, but she'll hand together."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_12","I've got a good feeling about the next mission."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_13","We'll be flying on one engine next mission. It'll be fine."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_14","Hope you like a bumpy ride. I'm of a mind to pull some loops."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_15","Someone's been stealing my tools again. I will find out who."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_16","This ship's full of thieves. Need to start nailing things down."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_17","You see a light-fingered sort creeping around? Hah! Look at who I'm talking to."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_18","Getting crowded on this ship ..."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_19","Grendyl's not messing around. Look at this place."
"loc_pilot_a__pilot_distance_20","I was meant for better than flying a shuttle run. Ah well, maybe one day ..."
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_a_01","I can't see a thing down there. Did someone turn off the lights?"
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_a_02","Can't see much from up here. Looks like the district's under blackout."
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_a_03","I'm seeing blackout conditions from up here. I bet it's worse down the-re."
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_a_04","No one's told me why there's a blackout. You'll just have to make the best of it."
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_b_01","Lots of battle-scoring visible from up here. Maybe that's the reason?"
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_b_02","Battle rages in a place long enough, the power lines are going to get severed."
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_b_03","It's not a mystery. Battle's been raging here for ages. Shell must have cut a power line."
"loc_pilot_a__power_circumstance_start_b_04","Looks like a shell took out a power transfer station. I'd get used to it being dark."
"loc_pilot_a__prologue_end_event_02_01","Come on… Don't you fall apart on me now!"
"loc_pilot_a__prologue_end_event_04_01","I think that soulless Tech-Priest's been meddling with my Storm Raptor… Hang on out there!"
"loc_pilot_a__ranged_gameplay_02_01","Confirmed. Storm Raptor inbound."
"loc_pilot_a__ranged_gameplay_05_01","Storm Raptor to Zola! Coming in hot! Get to the hangar bay!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_01","Acknowledged."
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_02","Already in motion!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_03","Since you asked so nicely!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_04","Storm Raptor acknowledges!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_05","Coming to the rescue!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_06","I hear you!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_07","Air cavalry to the rescue!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_08","Lieutenant Masozi saves the day!"
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_09","Inbound. Try to stay alive."
"loc_pilot_a__sergeant_info_call_extraction_response_10","Time for a heroic rescue!"
"loc_pilot_a__shipmistress_hub_announcement_b_27_b_01","My apologies, shipmistress. It will not happen again [Sotto] Whatever it was."
"loc_pilot_a__shipmistress_hub_announcement_b_28_b_01","It is a misunderstanding, I promise you."
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_01","Do not get your cogs in a twist. I am going!"
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_02","Calm down, clanky. I am on it!"
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_03","She is all heart, that one."
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_04","Hear that? She is going soft on you."
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_05","Quieten down! I know my job!"
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_06","Cool it, cyborg. I am on my way!"
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_07","Watch and learn, tech priest!"
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_08","I am all over it. You should trust more."
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_09","Careful, clanky ... you sound concerned."
"loc_pilot_a__tech_priest_info_call_extraction_response_10","Clanky almost sounded worried. Imagine that?"
"loc_pilot_a__trapped_response_01","Time to show them what you are made of. Not literally."
"loc_pilot_a__trapped_response_02","It's like someone kicked a slagroach nest!"
"loc_pilot_a__trapped_response_03","You don't wanna see what I can see!"
"loc_pilot_a__trapped_response_04","That area is heaving with dregs!"
"loc_pilot_a__trapped_response_05","You have a fight on your hands now!"
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_01","Lot of clouds down there. I guess the vent system's packed up again."
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_02","Poor visibility from up here. Looks like the vent system's having a bad day."
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_03","The vent system in places like this are never reliable. Still, it adds variety, eh?"
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_04","The vent system's on the wonk again, is it? That's why I carry my own air supply with me."
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_01","Recycled air is always a problem. You never quite know what's in it."
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_02","I hope no one has allergies ..."
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_03","Rather you than me. That muck looks horrible."
"loc_pilot_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_04","The question is, does it tickle or burn when you breathe it in?"
"loc_pilot_a__vox_introduction_pilot_01","Masozi here."
"loc_pilot_a__vox_introduction_pilot_02","This is Masozi."
"loc_pilot_a__vox_introduction_pilot_03","Masozi speaking."
"loc_pilot_a__vox_introduction_pilot_04","You've got Masozi. Listen up."
"loc_pilot_a__vox_introduction_pilot_05","Masozi here."
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_one_01_01","Prisoners all secure, ma'am."
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_02_01","Of course, ma'am!"
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_03_01","But do be wary. Every one of them is a filthy heretic."
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_07_01","Of course, ma'am. Upon my life."
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_09_01","Makes you wonder why we even bother shipping trash like that..."
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_11_01","Save a lot of dataslate work just to process the execution notice now."
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_13_01","And ours, you worthless piece of-"
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_17_01","But of course! I’ll just let you out now then!"
"loc_prison_guard_a__cs_prologue_two_19_01","Throne of Terra! We’re boarded!"
"loc_prison_guard_a__narrative_event_bay_02_01","GRENADE!"
"loc_prologue_traitor_a__cs_prologue_two_22_01","Come with us, brother. We have a way out."
"loc_prologue_traitor_a__cs_prologue_two_23_01","What do we do about that one?"
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_01","It's working again ... I think."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_02","Uplink looks good. Well ... good enough."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_03","Uplink's active again. That's handy."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_04","The uplink's looking better."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_05","That did it. Not sure why."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_06","Yeah ... That did it."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_07","Uplink's running again. But don't get cocky."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_08","We're back in business!"
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_decode_resuming_a_09","There we go. I knew you'd fix it."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_01","Extraction's red-lined. You'd better fix it."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_02","Oi, darlings? Something's wrong."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_03","That doesn't sound right to me."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_04","I think the cypher's having trouble."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_05","The interrogator needs your attention."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_06","That's ... not right. Over to you lot."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_07","The interrogator needs a whack."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_08","I don't think that's working right."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_09","That interrogator's making heavy weather."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_fix_decode_a_10","[Cough] I think something's wrong, my darlings."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_place_device_a_01","Now that looks like a good spot for a data-interrogator."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_place_device_a_02","That's where the data-interrogator goes, my darlings."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_place_device_a_03","Data-interrogator should be snug right there."
"loc_purser_a__cmd_hacking_place_device_a_04","That's your data-site, my loves. Better get to it."
"loc_purser_a__eavesdropping_purser_01","I thought my ears were burning. Now I know why."
"loc_purser_a__eavesdropping_purser_02","Just a quick reminder my darlings: I can hear everything you say."
"loc_purser_a__eavesdropping_purser_03","Just remember, your vox is routed through the Mourningstar ... so I hear everything."
"loc_purser_a__eavesdropping_purser_04","Hello my darlings ... Thought I'd remind you that this isn't a private channel."
"loc_purser_a__eavesdropping_purser_05","Just as well she can't hear you say that, isn't it my darlings?"
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_01","One dead. Start on the next."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_02","Nasty thing. You'd better kill them all."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_03","Killing one's good. Killing them all's better."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_04","And? Better kill the next one too."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_01","One left. Take it out."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_02","Kill that last disgusting lump and you're done."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_03","One more awaiting your attention."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_a_04","Go on ... Get that last one dead and all."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_01","Looks like we've got more."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_02","There are more of 'em. Always are."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_03","More of those things."
"loc_purser_a__event_demolition_more_corruptors_a_04","Hello ... Looks like you're not done."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_01","You could die tomorrow, so why not spend today?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_02","Got something in special, just for you."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_03","Aquilas burning a hole in your pocket? I've got just the thing."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_04","Fair warning: thieves will be spaced. No exceptions."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_05","If you see Rannick, you tell him to keep his nose outta my stores, yeah?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_06","I'm not saying this is black market gear, but I'm not saying it ain't, either."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_07","Looking gets you nothing, but aquilas? Well, that's a whole other world."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_08","Come on, come on! What are you waiting for? Buy something!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_09","#Ahoy for the frontier, and lashings of plunder...#"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_10","#I'm off to go a-reaving, a-reaving, a-reaving. I'm off to go a-reaving ... who'll slip a berth with me?#"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_11","Grog! The Perfect One calls for grog! ... Oh, here it is."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_12","Oh, the tales I could tell you about the Mourningstar ... Some of 'em are even true!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_13","Rannick keeps threatening to put me off the ship. I'd like to see him try."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_14","Busy around here today, but no one's buying. For shame!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_15","Zola looking after you, is she my darling?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_16","Get your delectables here! All blood already washed off, guaranteed!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_17","Vintage battlefield gear, yours for the claiming!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_18","Cheer up, my darling! You've a face like a kicked krootox!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_19","Who stole my grog? Don't make me come looking for you!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_20","Rannick accused me of picking through the dead, but he knows perfectly well that I have minions for that. Idiot of a man."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_eight_a_01","Watch your attitude, Morrow. Accidents do happen aboard this ship."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_eight_c_01","Have it your way. Just don't lean too heavily on a handrail, or linger in an airlock, you hear?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_eighteen_b_01","Still working on it. Seller's market out there at the moment, and slim pickings."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_eleven_b_01","Your Calthan brandy? Course I did. Good price too. Swing by when your shift ends."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_fifteen_b_01","Sorry my darling, no can do. They're all on high priority, need-to-know assignments."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_five_b_01","Maybe I does, maybe I doesn't. Ain't your business either way."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_forty_c_01","Oh, go on. Fight! Fight! Fight!"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_four_b_01","I know just the fellow to get the job done ... for the right price, of course."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_fourteen_b_01","Think nothing of it. Happy to help ... as long as the aquilas keep flowing."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_nine_a_01","Listen, Morrow. We're on the same side, right? So let's act like it."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_nine_c_01","Only regulations on this ship come from Mistress Brahms, not you. Keep that in mind."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_nineteen_a_01","Zola? Part of your requisition's just come in."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_one_b_01","Nothing wrong with my prices, my darling. And I'll thank you to mind your own business."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_seven_a_01","Morrow! Will you kindly stop your jackboots bothering my customers?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_seven_c_01","[Muffled Scream of Frustration/Anger]"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_seventeen_b_01","Of course my darling. Let me have the list, I'll give you a price."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_six_a_01","Oi, Morrow! I heard you've been interfering with some of my shipments."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_six_c_01","Contraband? The shipmistress will hear about this ... if you're lucky."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_sixteen_b_01","Aggravating? Me? He's the one who started it."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_ten_a_01","The more I talk to you, Morrow, the more I warm to greenskins."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirteen_b_01","Supply runs have got a bit hairy lately. Can't blockade what you can't see, can you?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirty_a_01","Have you been meddling with my terminal, Hadron? I warned you about that."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtyone_a_01","Don't know what I did to get lumbered with a cheerless tech-priest slinking around my ship."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtyone_c_01","Yeah. All right. I'm totally convinced, I am. Honest."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtytwo_a_01","Something's been eating away at my datastore. Contacts, trade routes, leverage ... all of it lost. Looking at you, tech-priest."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_three_b_01","Oh, so you want something, do you? Let me see what I can do."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twelve_b_01","Don't worry, I can lay my hands on a spare. And a less cantankerous tech-priest."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twenty-three_a_01","Zola? The Shipmistress is getting touchy about your rejects wandering about the place."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twenty-three_c_01","Agreement and being happy aren't the same thing, you know that."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twenty_a_01","Zola? We need to have a talk about Morrow. He's getting worse."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentyeight_a_01","You sure I can't get you some new robes, Hadron? Those ones look ancient."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentyfive_b_01","Expect away! But learn to live with disappointment."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentyfour_b_01","Don't I know it? Sorry, strictly confidential."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentynine_a_01","Do you not ever smile, Hadron? Or laugh? Or chitter excitedly? "
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentynine_c_01","If you say so, my darling."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentyone_a_01","You still around out there, Zola? Haven't see you for a while."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentyseven_b_01","Sounds like someone wants to join in? Don't worry, I won't tell anyone."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentysix_b_01","Should you? Well off you toddle, duty done."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentysixa_b_01","Happy to do it. We're all on the same side, right?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_twentytwo_a_01","Zola? I've had some special issue gear come in. Though I'd give you first refusal."
"loc_purser_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_two_b_01","I'll be there, little man ... In my own good time."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_01","Take a look - but no funny business."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_02","Just remember, it's aquilas up front."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_03","Still alive, are you? ... Guess I lose the bet."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_04","You look like a light-fingered sort. I'm watching you."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_05","Hang on ... Don't you have a debt to settle? My mistake. Thinking of someone else. Maybe..."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_06","I've got my eye on you."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_07","You keep your hands where I can see them."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_08","I've heard about you ..."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_09","Not sure we need your sort around here."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_10","What do you want?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_11","Don't you be wasting my time now."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_12","Don't be testing my patience."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_13","I know your sort."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_14","Behave yourself, and we'll get along."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_15","You stay honest and I'll stay smiling."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_16","You've the look of a rapscallion. Just remember: I've seen it all."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_17","Look at what washed ashore ..."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_18","I smell a scoundrel, I do."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_19","Oh ... What do you want?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_20","Yes I'm ... listening."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_01","Quality wares - all hand selected, just for you."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_02","Aren't you an interesting one?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_03","Got a fine cut to your jib, you have."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_04","I've got just the thing for you."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_05","Long as you've got the aquilas..."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_06","Take your time ... If you think you've got that long ..."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_07","Hello stranger ..."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_08","Hello there, darling. Feeling flush?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_09","Don't be afraid to splurge. I won't tell."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_10","Nothing but the best."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_12","All donations to the Hallowette retirement fund graciously received."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_13","What can I do for you?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_15","Don't be shy, darling. I don't bite. [Laugh]"
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_16","Prices are a clearly marked ... and non-negotiable."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_17","No returns. No refunds. No guarantees."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_18","Got the urge to splurge?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_19","Hello darling."
"loc_purser_a__hub_interact_likes_character_20","Ahoy, darling."
"loc_purser_a__hub_rumours_vox_05_b_01","Me? Do I look like one to gossip? [Darker] Or someone you should address so familiarly?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_rumours_vox_06_b_01","Not a thing, but I'll look into it. [Sotto] Yeah, get right on it, I will."
"loc_purser_a__hub_rumours_vox_07_b_01","Is that right? You do know that this is an open channel?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_rumours_vox_07_d_01","Looking forward to it ... [Sotto] Now where did I put that needle pistol ... ?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_rumours_vox_08_a_01","[Cough to Clear Throat] Lord Melk? That ... special consignment just arrived for you."
"loc_purser_a__hub_rumours_vox_10_a_01","Melk? About arranging that meeting with the shipmistress?"
"loc_purser_a__hub_rumours_vox_10_c_01","She said she didn't have time for social climbers. Her exact words. Then she said something about an asteroid."
"loc_purser_a__info_all_players_required_a_01","You need to group up, just so's you know."
"loc_purser_a__info_all_players_required_a_02","Come on, come on. Gang up."
"loc_purser_a__info_all_players_required_a_03","All together now ..."
"loc_purser_a__info_all_players_required_a_04","Huddle in close. No slacking now."
"loc_purser_a__info_event_almost_done_a_01","Almost there ..."
"loc_purser_a__info_event_almost_done_a_02","Almost ..."
"loc_purser_a__info_event_almost_done_a_03","Keep at it!"
"loc_purser_a__info_event_almost_done_a_04","Don't look so dreary - it's going well!"
"loc_purser_a__info_event_one_down_a_01","That's one!"
"loc_purser_a__info_event_one_down_a_02","First one down!"
"loc_purser_a__info_event_one_down_a_03","That's a good start!"
"loc_purser_a__info_event_one_down_a_04","Keep on like that, yeah?"
"loc_purser_a__info_extraction_a_01","Masozi? Do you fancy hauling this lot out of the fire?"
"loc_purser_a__info_extraction_a_02","Time to come on home, you lot. Extraction's authorised."
"loc_purser_a__info_extraction_a_03","Well, I guess we could let you get out of there now. Seems fair."
"loc_purser_a__info_extraction_a_04","Extraction's inbound. I reckoned you wouldn't be wanting to stay there."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_01","It's working ..."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_02","Strong data signal ..."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_03","Sounds like gibberish to me, but I think it's working."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_04","Lovely, lovely, lovely. Smooth sailing from here."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_01","Almost there!"
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_02","Not long now, my darlings!"
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_03","Almost finished!"
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_04","Try to survive a bit longer. It's almost done."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_01","That's what we wanted!"
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_02","Interrogation's complete. I knew you'd cope."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_03","Job's done. Well I never."
"loc_purser_a__info_hacking_mission_complete_a_04","That's what we wanted, don't you reckon?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_black_market_a_01","Now this, I like."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_black_market_a_02","Look at all this. I feel a stirring, I do."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_black_market_a_03","Now this shows entrepreneurial spirit. I approve."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_black_market_a_04","Warms my heart to see such vibrant commerce. "
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_01","All looks to be in working order. Lovely. I'll be sure to stake my claim. You know, for the cause."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_02","Now this is a business venture waiting to be requisitioned."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_03","This is all in better nick than I expected. I smell profit ... if we can get rid of the heretics."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_04","Ah, I can almost smell the beer. Best not to think what they're fermenting, though."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_01","Oh, I do love a good bar fight. Not that this is a good bar, but you take what you can get."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_02","Won't be that easy. Prepare to repel boarders!"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_03","I'm not so sure the heretics will make it that easy."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_04","Can't go leaving without a fight, my darlings. Weapons up!"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_01","Time to bang on the door. And I do mean ""bang""."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_02","I do hope you brought some explosives."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_03","Now that looks like an opportunity to use some explosives."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_04","Time for a nice, satisfying kaboom, I reckon."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_01","Now this ... has potential. If we can get the Moebians moved out, I might move in."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_02","I reckon that all this place needs is a bit of a purging and a firm hand."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_03","If I were to - hypothetically - clear out these streets, do you think old Margrave would let me keep them?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_04","Now this is a place with character. Not much charm, but character."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_01","I grant you, it's not the most polished of recreation hubs, but all it needs is a bit of vision."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_02","It's not so bad around here really. Just needs the Moebians evicting."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_03","Bit of paint, some spangly lights and I reckon there's a brisk trade waiting to be claimed."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_04","You need to stop talking this place down, Zola. Just needs leadership ... and a lot of promethium."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_refectory_c_01","Bottom floor, that's what my contacts say. "
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_refectory_c_02","I reckon you'll need to be heading down."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_refectory_c_03","Unless I'm much mistaken, you'll find a terminal lower down."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_refectory_c_04","I hope you're looking for a fight, my darlings. Because you're getting one."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_01","Hello there, my darlings. Secret mission, is it? They're my favourite."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_02","Another day, another daring mission behind enemy lines? Lovely."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_03","Now this all looks fascinating. I wonder what you're up to?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_04","Oh look at this. Very clandestine. Don't mind me. Go about your business."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_01","Me, I'm just here to provide local knowledge. In case it's handy."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_02","I just thought I'd pop in. See if I could be of assistance."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_03","Don't you worry about me. I won't be in your way."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_04","Oh, hush now. I'm not going to be a bother. Cross my heart."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_01","But then they wouldn't have come down here, would they? Might have scuffed their shiny uniforms."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_02","What? Those toy soldiers of yours down in these streets? Give over."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_03","Wouldn't that cut into their preening time something fierce?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_04","You'd have to wake them up first. Sleepy little tykes, so I hear."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_01","He's worried that your rejects are making his golden boys look bad. Me? I'm just enjoying the company."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_02","Jealousy. That's why he's here. Afeared that his tin soldiers are losing out to these fine fellows. I'm just sociable."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_03","Old Melk's worried that you're taking the limelight off him, that's all. Me? I'm just friendly. Ask anyone."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_04","I'm just showing interest, that's all. It's Melk you want to watch. Fixing to stab you in the back, he is."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_01","Now that is what we call a ""bare-faced lie""."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_02","I shouldn't be surprised. Tall tales are all he has to offer."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_03","You take that back, you old snake-buzzard!"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_c_04","Like anyone would believe that. Hah!"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_b_01","And try not to damage anything. If those stimms aren't tainted, they'll have resale value."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_b_02","Don't worry about being picky. I'll take any untainted stimms right off your hands."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_b_03","[Clears Throat] To be clear, I'm claiming anything that's semi-fit for consumption."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_b_04","Waste not, want not, my darlings. Bring me home something nice."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_d_01","Don't you worry your fussy little beard over it."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_d_02","Oh, go and sit in the corner and think about dataslates, would you?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_d_03","You need to live a little. Fat chance of that if you don't watch your tongue."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_stims_d_04","Oh hush. Don't start a fight you can't possibly win."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_b_01","[Laugh] You're a bloodthirsty old goat."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_b_02","[Laugh] Calm down, grandad. You'll burst a blood vessel."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_b_03","[Laugh] It's good that you're happy about something."
"loc_purser_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_b_04","[Laugh] Oh, look at his beady little eyes light up."
"loc_purser_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_01","The heretics have got their hands on a supply train at Manufactorum HL-17-36's consignment yard."
"loc_purser_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_02","There's a supply train waiting at Manufactorum HL-17-36's consignment yard."
"loc_purser_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_03","Manufactorum HL-17-36's consignment yard holds a lovely supply train, ripe for the taking."
"loc_purser_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_04","Manufactorum HL-17-36's consignment yard is playing host to a splendiforous supply train."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_01","Our favourite heretics are making mischief up in stuffy old Throneside. That ain't so good."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_02","Throneside's heaving with heretics, and that's precisely the sort of thing you're meant to stop."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_03","We've got heretics all over Throneside. I could care less, but I don't make the rules."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_01","I took a wager with Zola that you lot could get in there, seize the Enclavum Baross Aegis Station and get out alive."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_02","Now, because I believe in you, I've been telling everyone you can reclaim the Enclavum Baross Aegis Station."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_03","Recapturing Enclavum Baross' Aegis Station should be well within your capabilities, my darlings."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_01","I hope you're not going to make a liar of me. You wouldn't like that."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_02","Go on then, reinforcement my reputation for tactical brilliance ... and don't let me down."
"loc_purser_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_03","There's a lot riding on this one - my reputation most of all - so it's time to shine."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_01","How are we doing in there? Still got all our arms and legs? Good."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_02","That's the warm up, my darlings. Main event's yet to come."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_03","This is exciting, isn't it? I'm not sure you're all going to pull through."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_04","Bet that lot got the old corpuscles moving, am I right?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_01","You getting sleepy, Melk? Sure you wouldn't rather be wrapped up with a nice cup of something warm?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_02","Don't go dozing off on me old timer. Wouldn't want to be without your ""guidance"", now would I?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_03","You know Melk, I shan't take it personally if you want to shove off and have a nice little nap somewhere."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_04","Still there, Melk? I thought you'd be asleep by now. Can't be easy keeping those eyes open at your age."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_01","Keep this up, my lovelies, and you'll make me proud."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_02","Nice work, you lot. You're well on your way to being in my good books."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_03","Nice to see a well-oiled team in motion. Making me blush with pride, you are."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_04","Don't you go blowing this now. You do want to stay in my good graces."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_two_b_01","Oh right. Charming, that is. We'll see how much authority you think I have when I'm spacing you out an airlock."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_two_b_02","Sounds like I need to send some of my lads around to have a quiet word with you, Melk."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_two_b_03","No authority? You won't be saying that when I'm shaking out your Requisitorium looking for contraband."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_banter_two_b_04","No authority? Me? Keep that in mind the next time your shuttle's drifting past all my lovely cannons."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_01","Looks like something's got its sticky tentacles in the blast gate controls. See to it, yeah?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_02","That blast gate's your only way out. You'd better find a way to get it open."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_03","The blast gate's your route out. If I were you, I'd find out why it's not opening."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_04","Oh ... That's not right. You need to get the blast gate open. Find the problem and sort it, yeah?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_01","I don't imagine you were expecting me, my darlings, but let's make some trouble, shall we?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_02","Hello ... This'll serve 'em right for leaving the vox channel open, won't it?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_03","Well, fancy that. Looks like I'm in charge for the time being."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_04","I reckon I'll handle this one. It can be our little secret, yes?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_01","The Moebians have sympathisers in Tertium, and they're paying 'em off."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_02","The Moebian 6th - scruffy looking ruffians they are - are paying off their sympathisers."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_03","There's a pay-off happening and the Moebians are doing the paying."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_04","There's an exchange happening in one of the Transit Hubs."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_01","Grendyl's spies say its a haul of prismata crystals, and I want 'em."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_02","Prismata crystals are worth a lot to the right buyer. And to me."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_03","No point letting the heretics keep those prismata crystals, is there?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_04","The prismata crystals are useless to you, but not to your Lady Alice."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_d_01","Barge in, grab the goodies and bring 'em to me. I'll see you're compensated."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_d_02","Hot foot it to the meeting point, acquire the crystals and we'll be best mates. You want that."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_d_03","So my darlings ... why don't you get over there and grab me those crystals?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_briefing_d_04","Get those crystals out of the Moebians' sweaty palms and bring 'em to me. You can do that, can't you?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_01","Don't you lot get any ideas about claiming that tank. I'll send someone else down for it."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_02","Looks like the tank crew scarpered. They'll let anyone in the Guard these days."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_03","Perfectly good Leman Russ with no one to ... reassign it. I smell profit."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_04","Barely a scratch on that tank. Looks like an old model and all. I wonder what it's worth?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_demolisher_melk_01_b_01","Is that right? Where did you serve: logistics, or as ablative armour?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_demolisher_melk_02_b_01","Give over, you old vulture. They've work to do."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_demolisher_melk_03_b_01","I wish someone had abandoned you in the field."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_a_01","All right, Melk. Why are you being so helpful? Let's have the truth."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_a_02","No more hedging, Melk. What in this for you?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_a_03","Still here, Melk? Why? Don't you have some datawork to abuse?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_a_04","You likely to stop stinking up this vox channel any time soon, Melk?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_c_01","I knew it. How much?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_c_02","How much do you want?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_c_03","You want a cut."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_c_04","There it is. The hand in my pocket. [Sigh] What's your price?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_b_01","Go stick your head in the reactor, you old goat."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_b_02","The pleasure's all yours."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_b_03","Stuff it."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_b_04","I won't forget this. Sleep lightly, Melk."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_01","I knew it was going too well! Better clear that jam, my darlings."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_02","Heretics and their little surprises ... Oh well, you know what to do."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_03","Never easy, is it? You'd better get the Riser working again."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_04","Something gumming up the works. I bet it's one of daemonic nasties."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_01","That'll teach it. The Riser should be working again now."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_02","Ugly little sprout, wasn't it? Hit the switch and get moving."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_03","Popped that eye something good, didn't you? Time to get moving."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_04","That should have done the job. Hit the switch again, yeah?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_02","I don't know about you, my darlings, but I'm ready to be done with all this."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_03","Tidily done. I almost wish I was down there with you."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_01","There you go. Home free, you are."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_02","Simple as can be. Don't know why anyone was worried."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_03","Almost home. I might even buy the first round of drinks."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_04","Poetry in motion and aquilas in my stash. Nothing finer."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_01","That's what we came for, my darlings."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_02","There it is. Loot with dead owners is the best kind."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_03","There's the pay-off. I've got buyers lined up, so let's not disappoint."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_04","There's the prize. I never doubted you. Well, only a little."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_c_01","Hush. The grownups are talking. Right, my loves, you need to kick the Ascension Riser into gear. That's your exit."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_c_02","Ignore him, my loves. Get the Ascension Riser moving. That'll get you clear."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_c_03","It's all in hand. Spin up the Ascension Riser, you lot. Time to come home."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_c_04","Pfffff. Now they ride the Ascension Riser to safety. Couldn't be easier."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_01","That's it. Hit the gate release and let's get back to it."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_02","Here's me wearing a big old smile. Just need to hit the gate release and we're done."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_03","Nicely done, my darlings. Hit the gate release and let's get going."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_04","Look at you, functioning like a well-oiled machine. Just the gate release to go."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_01","Brilliant, I don't think. The trains are in the way."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_02","Who left those trains there? Is this your doing, Melk?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_03","Bother. I didn't reckon on those trains blocking the path."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_04","Ah. You need to be on the other side of those trains."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_c_01","That's actually not a bad idea. Get to it, you lot."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_c_02","This tedious old fool's actually had a good idea."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_c_03","A stopped chronometer's right twice a day, I guess."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_c_04","You heard, my darlings. Smartly now."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_01","So far, so good. Now see to those trains."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_02","That's the power back on. What about those trains?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_03","You still need to move the trains, my darlings."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_04","Lockout's clear. Now see to the trains."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_01","Don't be scared. The power's off ... I think."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_02","Doesn't look like the power's on. This'll be easier than I thought."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_03","Power's off, is it? No screams and dancing from you lot today then."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_04","No power to the rails, so no need to be nervous."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_01","Oi! This ain't the time for a heroic last stand!"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_02","Why aren't you lot moving? Dead heroes don't bring Lady Alice her crystals."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_03","I reckon they'll keep coming for you. If only we had extraction ready. Oh ... that's right. We do."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_04","Extraction's waiting, but it won't be waiting long …"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_maze_a_01","Bit of a tangle, ain't it? "
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_maze_a_02","Don't you go getting lost down there."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_maze_a_03","We don't have time for you to be taking in the sights."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_maze_a_04","You lot going purposefully slow or what? "
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_b_01","Sorry ... why are you still here?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_b_02","I thought you were off telling tales?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_b_03","Persistent, aren't you? Clear off!"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_b_04","What's that buzzing, whining noise?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_siding_a_01","The siding isn't far now. "
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_siding_a_02","You lot still not at the siding? What a disappointment."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_siding_a_03","Any particular reason you're dragging your feet?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_siding_a_04","First the siding, then the transit hub, then ... profit! At least that's the plan."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_a_01","Stars above, this is a gloomy old place. Are we ready to get this show--"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_a_02","Don't rightly know how anyone can live down here. Still--"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_a_03","Get an eyeful of this place. Better you than me, but--"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_a_04","Look at all this. Even the dirt's covered in dirt. Then again--"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_c_01","Oh, woken up have we? I don't take orders from you."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_c_02","Who rattled your cage? Never mind. Go back to sleep."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_c_03","Any one else feel a yawn building? Or maybe a murderous rage?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_c_04","Quieten down Melk. No one cares."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_e_01","You just pop along and tell him then. The rest of you? Make for the maintenance siding."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_e_02","Yeah? Crawl away worm. We've got things to do. Head for the maintenance siding, you lot. We'll take the rest from there."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_e_03","Very interesting, I'm sure. Strike Team? Head off to the maintenance siding, there's good fellows."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_start_e_04","You lot? Keep on towards the maintenance siding. Ignore this worm."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_01","On we go through the depot, my lovelies. I can smell the profit."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_02","Just keep on through the depot and we'll be done in no time."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_03","The Transit Hub's on the other side of the depot ... I think."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_04","Not far to the Transit Hub. I mean ... assuming something nasty don't occur."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_01","Ah, subrails. Good place for a spot of smuggling."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_02","Always did like subrails. Proper smuggler's highway, they are."
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_03","This is going well. Don't let me down now, do you hear?"
"loc_purser_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_04","I hope you're not going to disappoint me. I don't like being disappointed."
"loc_purser_a__npc_first_interaction_a_01","Ahoy! I'm Commodore Hallowette, but you can call me ""My Lady Alice"" or ""Oh Perfect Mistress""."
"loc_purser_a__npc_first_interaction_b_01","Don't bother telling me your name, my darling - your sort don't last long, so I won't remember it."
"loc_purser_a__npc_first_interaction_c_01","Good customers, though? That's different. I might have one or two special items for you, if you've got the aquilas."
"loc_purser_a__npc_first_interaction_d_01","Strictly on the down-low, you understand? And don't tell Rannick."
"loc_purser_a__npc_first_interaction_e_01","Or do. I don't really care. He's so ... tedious."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_01","Well. I guess this is goodbye."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_02","I'll see you again. Or I won't."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_03","Spend more next time, and maybe you'll get a smile."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_04","Have fun out there. But not too much."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_05","Bring me back something nice next time."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_06","I guess this is goodbye."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_07","I'll see you again. If the heretics don't get you."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_08","You survive a bit, maybe I'll learn your name."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_09","Walking corpse, you are."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_10","Go on then. Shoo!"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_11","Keep moving. I've work to do."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_12","We're done here."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_13","That's it. Time to go."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_14","Off you trot, my darling."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_15","Don't you cry, my darling. I'll be fine. You ... ?"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_16","One born every minute, there is."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_17","Where does Zola find them, that's what I want to know."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_18","Off you go. Might be you even make it back."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_19","Heroes don't last long out here. Lucky for you, eh?"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_dislikes_character_20","Bye now."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_01","Kill a heretic for me, yeah?"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_02","Go knock 'em dead."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_03","You'll be fine. I mean, what can go wrong?"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_04","Like I always say, if you've gotta go, go with style."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_05","A legend in the making."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_06","Keep your head down and your eyes open, you hear?"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_07","Those heretics won't know what hit 'em."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_08","Looking good. They can't take that from you."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_09","Come again. I'm always here."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_10","Onwards! To death and glory! [Laugh]"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_11","#A plundering we go, we go, we go, we go, we go# [Laugh]"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_12","I'll see you soon."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_13","Be seeing you, my darling."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_14","You be careful now, my darling."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_15","Exciting times ahead."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_16","Stay safe!"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_17","Don't you go getting yourself killed, you hear?"
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_18","How quickly they grow. Brings a tear to the eye ..."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_19","You'll be fine. And if you're not? I'll find a home for your clobber."
"loc_purser_a__purser_goodbye_likes_character_20","Yeah. You're ready."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_01","You enjoy that, my darling."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_02","Now that's a bold choice ... I like it."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_03","Lovely, lovely, lovely."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_04","Glad to be of service."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_05","Now just remember ... no refunds."

"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_07","Pleasure doing business with you."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_08","I just knew the two of you were made for each other."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_09","Don't mind the blood spatter. It'll brush off."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_10","You wouldn't believe the grip the last owner had. So strong!"
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_11","Limited supply, that one. Glad it's found a home."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_12","[Catcall Whistle] There ain't no arguing with style."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_13","If I find you've been passing fake coins, you and I will have a ""chat""."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_14","Never be afraid to splurge, that's my motto."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_15","We never close."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_16","A fine choice, if I may say so. A very fine choice."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_17","You won't regret it ... Not that I accept returns."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_18","Thought of you as soon as I saw that one, I did."
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_19","Now that ... is something special. Mind leaving it to me in your will?"
"loc_purser_a__purser_purchase_20","The Hallowette retirement fund thanks you."
"loc_purser_a__shipmistress_hub_announcement_b_29_b_01","Right you are. Just got me a vagabond needs a talking to, and I'll be right with you."

"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_02","Always happy to take your hard-earned cash."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_03","You tell people that I've got the stuff they want."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_04","Nice doing business with you."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_05","Come again. Always happy to take your readies."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_06","Thanks. You won't regret it."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_07","Take it easy and try not to die, all right?"
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_08","Catch you later."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_09","Bye, then. "
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_10","See ya. Don't forget to watch your back!"
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_11","Take it easy."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_12","Thanks. Come back again."
"loc_reject_npc_a__goodbye_a_13","Cheers, mate."

"loc_reject_npc_a__hub_interact_a_02","Well, well, look who it is!"
"loc_reject_npc_a__hub_interact_a_03","Fancy seeing you here. How've you been?"
"loc_reject_npc_a__hub_interact_a_04","Welcome to my little slice of retail delight."
"loc_reject_npc_a__hub_interact_a_05","About time you showed up. I have got such a deal for you."
"loc_reject_npc_a__hub_interact_a_06","A little bit of what you fancy, right here for a fair price."
"loc_reject_npc_a__hub_interact_a_07","Wait until you see what I've got for you."

"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_03","I've got the best items you'll find. Guaranteed."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_04","Just keep it quiet where you got this, all right?"
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_05","Now that's a good choice."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_06","Trust me. If you've got the cash, I've got the goods."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_07","Awesome. A thing of beauty, that. Be a joy forever."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_08","Niiiiiiice choice."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_09","Not top of the range, but it'll do."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_10","You're not going to find better. Trust me."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_11","Rannick probably wouldn't approve. Like I care."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_12","Sweet. Got taste, you have."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_13","That was a good find."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_14","Bargain at twice the price."
"loc_reject_npc_a__purchase_a_15","You want that?"

"loc_sergeant_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_02_02","The Imperium's split in two: the bad half, and the even nastier half. The Cicatrix Maledictum's what did it. That clear it up?"
"loc_sergeant_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_02_03","Rannick said it's the result of a realspace cascade summoned by an anti-astropathic surge. That make any sense to you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_02_01","Too early to tell. But we ain't giving up until there's no hope left. That's the job."
"loc_sergeant_a__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_02_01","Tertium's something of a wonder - the grandest planetary capital for three sectors. We're to keep it that way, if we can."

"loc_sergeant_a__cs_pot02_03","So learn what they’re good for, and learn how to use them. Can you do that?"
"loc_sergeant_a__cs_pot02_04","To be honest, I don’t trust you. I don’t think you’ve got the brains to handle any of this gear."
"loc_sergeant_a__cs_pot02_05","Prove me wrong."
"loc_sergeant_a__cs_pot08_01","You’re making decent progress. I’ll give you that. But I need more."
"loc_sergeant_a__cs_pot08_02","Rannick’s still got eyes everywhere, hunting for the traitor on board. It could be anyone."
"loc_sergeant_a__cs_pot08_03","So if you want to prove yourself, you’ll have to work even harder."
"loc_sergeant_a__cs_pot08_04","Are we clear, acolyte? Put in the hours, and make yourself indispensable."

"loc_sergeant_a__eavesdropping_sergeant_03","A little louder and we will all hear you."
"loc_sergeant_a__eavesdropping_sergeant_04","You might want to shut off your comms."

"loc_sergeant_a__event_demolition_first_corruptor_destroyed_b_04","One down. Kill the others."
"loc_sergeant_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_01","One more to go. It's a big one."
"loc_sergeant_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_02","One last target. Get it done."
"loc_sergeant_a__event_demolition_last_corruptor_03","One last nasty to take out."

"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_disable_the_skyfire_04","Get those skyfire defences offline, right now. You wouldn't want Masozi to crash and burn!"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_01","We're all set. You just need to hold out until reinforcements arrive."
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_02","That's the lot. Now you've just gotta stay alive!"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_03","Good work! Reckon you can hold out until the support team arrives?"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_fortification_survive_04","Job's done. If you can stay alive, that's a bonus."
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_01","One last job: get the gate powered up!"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_02","Got a final task for you! The gate won't open without power."
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_03","So far, so good, but the gate won't open without power!"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_power_up_gate_04","Nearly there! Now get some power to that gate!"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_fortification_set_landing_beacon_01","Good work! Now set the landing beacon for your support team!"

"loc_sergeant_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_05","You've arrived at a new scan location. Auspexes and elbows. Get it done!"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_06","Well, you're there, but you don't seem to be scanning. Fancy telling me why?"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_07","Get another auspex sweep underway, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_scan_find_targets_more_a_08","You've reached another suitable scanning zone. Auspexes out!"

"loc_sergeant_a__event_scan_more_data_05","The skull's locating new targets. Keep up with it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__event_scan_more_data_06","You did good, but we need more targets. Follow the Servo-Skull."
"loc_sergeant_a__event_scan_more_data_07","We need more damn data. Don't let that skull out of your sight."

"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_13","War zones are shifting. Too early to tell which way."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_14","We fight to the last. Theirs, or ours."

"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_five_a_01","Lots of drunken rejects hanging around the crew decks. You wouldn't know nothing about that, right commodore?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_four_a_01","Commodore Hallowette? I've got some rejects that need licking into shape."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_nine_b_01","I don't have a problem with that ... so long as you follow the regs."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_one_a_01","Commodore, do you mind not fleecing my no-hopers? It's bad for morale."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_seven_b_01","This is a mission-sensitive area. Can't have a rabble gathering. It's against regs."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_six_b_01","Me? Nah. Destroyed some contraband, that's all."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_ten_b_01","I can see that. You've got a lot in common with those xenos filth."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtyfive_a_01","Not sure how we're supposed to win a war with weapons like this ..."

"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_thirtysix_b_01","What's a relic without a bit of wear and tear? Shows it's been well-used."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_three_a_01","Commodore ... Zola tells me you're the person to see for ... special orders?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_2nd_phase_conversation_two_a_01","Commodore Hallowette to the strategium. We have an Alpha Three situation."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_eleven_b_01","Yeah? Let me get this lot on the way, and I'll be right with you."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_five_a_01","Masozi? After this next drop, Rannick wants a word. Don't know why."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_four_a_01","Masozi? Brunt says he can't get those parts you wanted."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_nine_b_01","I hear you, explicator, but I need more bodies on the ground."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_one_a_01","Masozi! You got an update on the latest Convoy 25-Epsilon?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_seven_b_01","Stuff breaks in the field, you know that ... But I'll let them know."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_six_a_01","How's the vox net holding up, Tech-Priest?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_ten_a_01","Our strike force attrition rate ... ? Well, it ain't good. We need more recruits."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_ten_c_01","Yeah? Guess we'll have to see, won't we?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_three_a_01","I heard that last extraction was a bloody mess. What happened?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_twelve_b_01","I'll look into it. Leave it with me."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_idle_conversation_two_a_01","You ready to fly, Masozi?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_a_01","Found your way to the Mission Terminal did you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_b_01","Guess that means I can't have you executed. Not yet."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_c_01","Heh."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_d_01","This is the heart of the operation. Your best friend if you want to stay in my good books."

"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_f_01","The only hope we have in this mess lies in us sending our strike teams where they're needed."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_g_01","Making a difference wherever we can. For as long as we're still breathing."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_h_01","No guarantees on that last bit, by the way."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_intro_mission_terminal_i_01","So ... You ready to be a hero?"

"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_03_a_01","Things are picking up around here, so Lord Melk will be advising on missions. Don't give him any lip, got it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_03_c_01","I guess we'll find out."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_04_a_01","Lord Melk? I'm hearing our Flight Lieutenant's wanting to discuss protocol with you."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_05_a_01","Commodore? I hope you're not behind these rumours of some kind of ""cult"" at work on Atoma?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_06_a_01","Commodore? The ammo supplies for my auric strike teams keep going missing. Wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_07_a_01","I'm not gonna warn you again, Hallowette. Pack it in, or I'll get the inquisitor involved."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_07_c_01","What? ... Never mind, we'll have words in private later."
"loc_sergeant_a__hub_rumours_vox_09_b_01","They still alive? Then the rest don't matter."
"loc_sergeant_a__hunting_circumstance_start_a_01","Looks like the heretics are using this region for a bit of sport. Expect more Pox Hounds."

"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_entrance_04","Head inside Hab Block Dreyko. Let's take a look."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_01","Right, here's the plan. Head to the Transit Hub. Look for plague residue and scan it."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_02","There's plague residue in the Transit Hub. Get yourself over there and start scanning."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_03","Alright. Here's what you have to do. Scan plague residue over at the Transit Hub. Easy."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_first_objective_04","Head out the Transit Hub and scan any plague residue you find."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_market_01","You should be passing above the marketplace."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_market_02","If you're on track, the marketplace is just below you."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_market_03","The marketplace is just below you."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_market_04","That's the marketplace below ... assuming you've not gotten lost."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_market_05","There's the marketplace. Bless me, but you're actually on course."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_01","Okay ... You've reached the quarantine zone. Keep your eyes peeled for scan targets."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_02","You're passing into the quarantine zone. Be alert for scan targets."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_03","This is the quarantine zone's outer edge. Move on inside. I'll call out scan targets."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_quarantine_04","Picking up scanning targets. Proceed into the quarantine zone."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_roof_01","Moving through the superstructure. Watch your step. It can get a little tangled."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_roof_02","Lots of power conduits up there. Watch your fire - you could black out half the sector."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_roof_03","The side of the hab blocks few get to see, eh?"
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_roof_04","Normally get scavs squatting up here, but not now. One benefit of the uprising."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_roof_05","There's nothing much to see up here. Keep moving to the next block."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_01","That's it! You've got we came for!"
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_02","Data flow complete! Good work!"
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_03","We've got it! Time to leave!"
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_04","Upload complete! Job's done!"
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_scan_complete_05","That's it! Nothing more you can do there but die!"
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_void_response_01","Could be worse. Tertium's quite airy, as hive cities go."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_void_response_02","Enjoy it while you can. It gets worse down in the manufacturing levels."
"loc_sergeant_a__level_hab_block_void_response_04","Oh. This is the nice bit of Tertium. But you won't have to take my word for it."
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_01_a_01","Attention all Rejects: The Hourglass is seething with heretics. Report for duty and kill some for me, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_03_a_01","Attention all Rejects: Just remember, I don't want to hear any complaints. Ever."
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_04_a_01","Attention all Rejects: Report any sightings of Wolfer to me and only to me. I know Zola asked first, but I'm asking nicely. Got it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_05_a_01","Attention all Rejects: Anyone caught doing side business for that Krall character is gonna wish they hadn't. You have been warned."
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_06_a_01","Getting a lot of vox distortion right now. That can't be good."
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_07_a_01","If anyone sees Zola, tell her I want a word in private."
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_08_a_01","Don't let me catch any of you spreading rumours about one of the Karnak twins still being among the living. Got it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_09_a_01","This is your polite reminder to obey all standing orders. Don't wait for the impolite one."
"loc_sergeant_a__may_hub_announcement_10_a_01","I need a Strike Team on deck right now. Volunteers will be selected if there ain't any forthcoming."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_01","Okay, that's better. On with the mission."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_02","Ah. Relative quiet. Time to move on."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_03","Took you long enough. Get moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_alarm_off_04","Alarm's off and the mission's still on, so shake a leg."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_a_01","It's painfully obvious the Moebians ain't in this alone. They're getting help from within Tertium."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_a_02","Rannick's starting to suspect the Moebians have had help from within Tertium."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_a_03","Intel points to the Moebians having support from within Tertium itself, and that ain't good."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_a_04","All signs point to the Moebians not working alone in this little disaster. They've got help on the inside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_b_02","Fortunately, the shifting battle fronts have opened up access to Archivum Sycorax."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_b_03","Archivum Sycorax is bound to hide something we can use, so that's where you're headed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_b_04","Archivum Sycorax is within our strike range, and there's plenty of data buried inside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_c_01","Get in, access the Deep Archives and bring us back something juicy. We've seditionists to root out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_c_02","You're to access the Deep Archives and find us some nice, juicy intel. Let's find us some traitors."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_c_03","The main building's no use to you, but get into the Deep Archives and you're bound to find something."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_brief_c_04","Once you're in the Deep Archives, your servo-skull will help you dig up the dirt. She's a handy lass."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_b_01","Make your way through the Cogitator Hall. It's not far now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_b_02","You'll have to head through the Cogitator Hall. "
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_b_03","Press on through the Cogitator Hall, but keep your eyes open."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_cogitator_hall_b_04","The Cogitator Hall's a good place for an ambush, so stay alert."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_b_01","The Deep Archives? At last. Come on, come on. Get to it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_b_02","You finally reached the Deep Archives did you? About time."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_b_03","The Deep Archives? You should have been here ages ago."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deep_archives_b_04","And at last, they reach the Deep Archives. Better late than never. More or less."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deeper_01","You lot not at the Deep Archives yet? Come on, shift it up a gear."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deeper_02","You're still not at the Deep Archives? Hurry it up!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deeper_03","The Deep Archives aren't gonna come to you, so move!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_deeper_04","The Deep Archives are waiting, but I'm not. Sort yourselves out!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_end_event_complete_01","That's it! Plenty for Rannick to pick over there. Time to come home."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_end_event_complete_04","You've got the data, which makes me a happy man. Get out of there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_01","Right! This is it. Deploy the servo-skull and let's find that data!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_02","You're here! Deploy the servo-skull and let her go to work!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_03","This is the place! Deploy the servo-skull and follow her lead!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_end_event_start_04","Time to let your servo-skull off her lease and find that data!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_first_objective_01","Head straight for Archivum Sycorax. Let's get this down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_first_objective_02","First objective is to reach the Archivum. Move it, yeah?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_first_objective_03","The Archivum should be just up ahead. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_first_objective_04","We've dropped you more or less on the Archivum. You'll be there in no time."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_01","That's right. Your sort go in through the servitor's entrance. Hang a left."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_02","I reckon the servitor's entrance is more your thing anyway."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_03","Veer left. You'll find the servitor's entrance. Much more your station in life."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_front_door_b_04","You'll find another entrance nearby. Not as salubrious, but you'll be fine."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_01","Quit your moaning and get on with it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_02","Do you really think I care?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_03","Yeah, I'm making notes for next time. Honest."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_start_banter_b_04","Oh right then, guess I'll just call the mission off. Get moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_01","If you can clear the vent substacks, you can get inside. Mind out for the alarm."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_02","The vent substacks are your only way in. I'm sure you can work around the alarm."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_03","The vent substacks are alarmed, but they're you're only way in. "
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_substack_alarm_04","The next part of your journey heads through the vent substacks. And setting off an alarm."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_01","Alright. This is Vault Walk. Almost there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_02","Vault Walk? Good. You're in the right place."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_03","You're at Vault Walk? Well, well, well. Means you didn't get lost."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_archives_vault_walk_04","Okay, stick with Vault Walk and even you can't get lost."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_01","Power's restored. Good work!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_02","That's the power restored. You'll be on the move soon."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_bridge_powered_a_03","Good work. Power's flowing and we should be good to move."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_01","We've had reports of a new strain of the Blight. We need you to find a sample we can analyse."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_02","The Blight has evolved again. We need a fresh sample to analyse."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_03","The Blight has changed, and our old analyses are useless. This is where you come in."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_one_04","A new form of the Blight is tearing through Tertium, and we need information."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_01","The Inquisitor's showing personal interest in this mission, so don't disappoint."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_02","That's all I've got. Try to come back alive, if you can."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_03","Recon suggests light resistance in the area, but keep your eyes open."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_three_04","The Dregs are all over neighbouring districts, so expect some company while you're down there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_01","You're deploying to Transit Hub HL-16-11. Scan plague residue for this new strain, analyse it, and get out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_02","Transit Hub HL-16-11 has been hit hard. Find plague residue, scan it and maybe we'll get lucky."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_03","You're going into the Transit Hub HL-16-11 quarantine zone. Find plague residue and scan it for the mutant strain."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_brief_control_mission_two_04","Storm Raptor will insert you into Transit Hub HL-16-11. You're looking for plague residue to scan for the evolved strain."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_01","The heretics are getting ready to move a supply train out of Manufactorum HL-17-36."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_02","There's a supply train full of all kinds of goodies waiting at Manufactorum HL-17-36's consignment yard."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_03","You're off to Manufactorum HL-17-36, where the heretics are preparing to send out a supply train."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_a_04","Recon tells me there's a heretic supply train leaving Manufactorum HL-17-36 for the front lines."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_01","Now we can't have that, and the Emperor knows we could use those supplies for ourselves."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_02","I want those supplies to help us fight the good fight. No ifs. No buts."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_03","The way this war's going, those supplies could tip the balance, so I want 'em."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_b_04","Can't ever have too many supplies, as my dear old quartermaster at arms used to say."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_01","So you're gonna get in there, secure a foothold and wait for reinforcements to come take the goods off your hands, understand?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_02","Your job's to reach the Consignment Yard and secure the area. Once that's done, I'll send in a capture team to finish the job."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_03","You get a beach head secured, and I'll get troops moving at this end. You'll not be doing the fetching and carrying, so give us a smile."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_briefing_c_04","You're the advance team: secure the Consignment Yard and signal for reinforcements. Well within your capabilities."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_01","Okay, this is the Consignment Yard. Secure the area and await reinforcement."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_02","This is it! Secure the Consignment Yard and await support!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_03","I want this Consignment Yard locked down, ASAP!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_consignment_yard_04","There's our prize. Get this Consignment Yard locked down!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_01","You've reached Coolant Control? Look for a door release."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_02","There'll be a door release to the Consignment Yard somewhere."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_03","This is Coolant Control. Find a way to access the Consignment Yard."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_coolant_control_04","You're in Coolant Control now. Should be a way to access the Consignment Yard."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_01","You can reach the Consignment Yard via the Production Nexus. Let's get moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_02","First stop's the Production Nexus. You can reach the Consignment Yard from there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_03","Get down to the Production Nexus. From there, you can make your way to the Consignment Yard."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_first_objective_04","You'll start by heading for the Production Nexus. You can get to the Consignment Yard from there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_01","That did it. Head for Coolant Control. The Consignment Yard is just after it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_02","Good to proceed. Head in the direction of Coolant Control."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_03","Good work! You can get to Coolant Control now, and the Consignment Yard soon after."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_end_04","Not bad. Head out to Coolant Control. You might reach the Consignment Yard yet."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_01","You can get access to the Consignment Yard through here. Put your data-interrogators to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_02","Get your data-interrogators set - you need that door open!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_03","You're at the Production Nexus. Use your data-interrogators to get that door open."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_mid_event_start_04","That door needs a nudge from your data-interrogators. Get to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_production_line_01","The Production Nexus is just below you. Find a way down!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_production_line_02","The Production Nexus is below you. Not far now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_production_line_03","You're just above the Production Nexus. Keep going."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_production_line_04","Okay. The Production Nexus is just below you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_01","Good work! It's time to stand down!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_02","We can take it from here. Time to come back to the Mourningstar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_03","Your part's done. We've got the train. That's what matters."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_reinforcements_04","Train secured. I'll see to it those supplies go where they're needed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_01","These grunts got us this foothold. Lot of their fellows didn't make it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_02","Wasn't easy getting this foothold. These are the survivors."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_03","Might want to watch your mouth. This piquet line ain't exactly safe duty."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_b_04","Not everyone get to have the glorious jobs. Guess you're lucky, ain't you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_01","Press on through the Worker's Cloister. Not far now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_02","Keep moving through the Worker's Cloister."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_03","Move up through the Worker's Cloister. Keep your eyes peeled."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cargo_worker_cloister_04","You've reached the Worker's Cloister. You're on the right path."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_bridge_01","Regular stronghold, ain't it? Bet you're glad they didn't have time to raise the bridge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_bridge_02","They've made a solid defensible position. Those turrets aren't part of the original design."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_bridge_03","Get across and watch your step. It's a long way down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_bridge_04","We could take this fortress, if we'd the mind. But it's better to use it against them."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_one_02","Time for a bit of counter-intel work. Let's dump some nice, juicy fake recon data into the Torrent's cogitator array."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_one_03","You're heading for the Torrent's cogitator array to upload some dodgy recon data."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_one_05","Right. We're looking at feeding the Heretics some bad intel via the cogitator array out in the Torrent."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_one_08","Next stop: the Torrent's cogitator array. We're giving the Heretics some crooked intel to get them chasing shadows."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_01","Once you're in, upload the data package to the cogitator array, and job's a good 'un."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_02","Once you've got access to the cogitator array, feed it the bad intel, then get out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_03","Get the data uploaded, and get back here as soon as you can. There's always more work to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_three_04","The rest of it's pretty simple. Get in. Upload the data. Get out. Get drunk."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_01","The array's locked down tight, so you'll need today's cypher-idents. Use the servo skull to track them down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_02","You'll need today's cypher-idents, but your servo skull can track those down for you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_03","Take your servo skull to track the cypher-idents down. Once she has them, you can get inside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_brief_two_04","Security's tight, but not too tight. Use your servo skull to sniff out today's cypher-idents."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_01","Right. That's it - the entrance to Ragtown."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_02","Ragtown gate up ahead. Let's keep it moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_03","You're crossing through into Ragtown. Welcoming, ain't it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_checkpoint_04","And here you are at Ragtown. Don't waste time taking in the sights. There aren't any."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_01","You'll need to disable the security stacks before you can upload our intel."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_02","You can't upload the data until the security stacks are disabled."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_03","Get those security stacks disabled!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_disable_security_04","Almost done - get the security stacks disabled!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_01","Good work. I can piece the cypher-ident together from what you've assembled. Authorising your crypt-key for elevator access."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_02","That's it. We have the cypher-ident. Head for the elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_03","About time! But I've reconstructed the cypher-ident. Crypt-key updated - head to the elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_elevator_access_04","That's the cypher-ident! Head out to the elevator. I'll authorise your crypt-key for access."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_01","Right. Next step's to get to the bazaar. Lots of infighting since the heretics absorbed the Water Cartel.  So, you shouldn't struggle finding a body to relieve of its cypher-idents."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_02","Head for the bazaar. Lots of 'trials of worthiness' take place over there. You'll find the cypher-idents we need on one body or another."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_03","Hit up the bazaar next, and search the bodies for cypher-idents."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_find_bazaar_04","Move on to the bazaar and get your servo skull looking for cypher-idents."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_01","What you need is cypher idents. What you have is none of them. Go check out the bazaar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_02","Get your carcasses moving the bazaar. We need cypher idents."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_03","We need cypher idents. The bazaar's probably your best bet."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_first_objective_04","You need to get cypher idents. Reckon that the bazaar is going to be the best place for you to look."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_01","Lots of bodies around. Someone will have the cypher-ident we need."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_02","No shortage of volunteers to offer up a cypher-ident."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_03","Time for the easiest pickpocketting you'll ever do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_get_passcodes_04","Right. Let's get that cypher-ident, and get this done."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_01","Looks like you're on track. Keep moving until you're through the shanty town."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_02","You're making good time. Just a little further until you're past the shanty town."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_03","That's it … Keep going. Expect fiercer resistance up ahead."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_keep_moving_04","Okay, you're almost out of the first section. Keep going until you get to Ragtown."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_pillar_01","These stairways were built for maintenance. As you can see, they've been pressed to other things."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_pillar_02","This is Tertium all over - if there's a nook or cranny, someone'll make a home of it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_pillar_03","Got to admire the ingenuity of folk who'll make a home anywhere. Rather them than me."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_pillar_04","Stick to the stairs. These pillars have maintenance access at all levels."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_sewer_01","Still not exactly water you'd want to drink, is it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_sewer_02","Look down. That's the water supply for half this district."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_sewer_03","Water's cleaner here. Not that you'd know it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_sewer_04","Hard to tell the open sewers from the fresh water hereabouts, ain't it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_01","Life's tough all across the Imperium. Ain't our problem."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_02","Lucky for you, we ain't staying … so pick up your feet."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_03","Makes you realise how cushy you've got it on the Mourningstar, don't it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_shanty_response_04","Won't be hearing you complain about your quarters in future, I guess?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_01","Trader's Row. Everything for sale, and the Water Cartel took its cut."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_02","Funny how you get the same sorts of places everywhere. There are places like Trader's Row in every city on every world."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_03","Trader's Row. Keep moving. You've a way to go next."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_town_centre_04","First the Water Cartel, now the heretics. Probably doesn't change much for the traders."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_upload_01","Right! Now punch that bad intel into the heart of the cogitator array."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_upload_02","Nice work! Now get the upload done!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_upload_03","Beautiful! Now let's give those traitors a good dose of bad intel."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_upload_04","That's it! Deploy the package before the security stacks come back online."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_use_passcode_01","You're here. Time to put that cypher-ident to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_use_passcode_03","Let's hope the cypher-ident works."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cartel_use_passcode_04","Here we are. Put the cypher-ident to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_a_01","We've been tasked with getting an encrypted report out to a listening station on the edge of the system."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_a_02","There's an encrypted report the powers that be want transmitted to a listening station on the system's edge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_a_03","We've got an encrypted report that needs transmitting to a listening station on the system's edge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_a_04","You're playing courier. We've an encrypted report needs transmitting to a listening station up in the big black."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_b_01","We can't broadcast it from the Mourningstar, for reasons that don't matter to you so we're borrowing a comms-plex dish."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_b_02","It can't be sent from the Mourningstar, so we need an alternate method: a groundside comms-plex dish."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_b_03","The Mourningstar can't do the job on this occasion, so we're borrowing a comms-plex dish from Tertium."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_b_04","There's a comms-plex dish on Tertium that should do the job. Don't ask why the Mourningstar can't. You're not cleared."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_c_01","Said dish is on top of Archivum Sycorax, deep in contested territory, so at least you'll not be bored."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_c_02","That means you're off to Archivum Sycorax. It's in traitor hands, so you're bound to be busy."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_c_03","That dish is on top of Archivum Sycorax. Means you'll have a fight on your hands to get there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_brief_c_04","You'll be heading into Archivum Sycorax in Throneside. Intel says their dish is still functional, and it has the oomph we need."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_01","Good work. Now you just need an elevator to get you to the upper floors."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_02","Okay. Now find the elevator. Trust me, it's a lot of stairs to the top."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_03","If the elevator's still working, you'll want to use it to get higher."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_04","Nicely done. Now find the elevator and head towards the roof."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_01","It's here! Get moving before you're overrun!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_02","Elevator's here! Time to get moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_03","Into the elevator! Double-time!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_elevator_here_04","Get your worthless hides into the elevator!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_first_objective_01","First up: this is the wrong enclavum. You can use a Skylink to reach the right one."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_first_objective_02","Look for the Skylink bridge. The Archivum's on a different one of these islands."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_first_objective_03","Once you reach the Skylink bridge you can cross to the next enclavum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_first_objective_04","Head for the Skylink bridge. From there, you can head to the Archivum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_01","Okay, this is Old Shrine Street. One last push, and you're there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_02","You're on final approach, and making better time than I expected."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_03","Keep it moving through Old Shrine Street. You're not here to sightsee."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_old_shrine_street_04","Old Shrine Street's your last waypoint before you hit the archivum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_01","You're making progress. Keep heading for Archivum Sycorax."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_02","That's the way. Keep on to Archivum Sycorax."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_03","You should still be heading for Archivum Sycorax."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_progress_archivum_04","Archivum Sycorax isn't far now. Keep up the pace."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_01","It's been weeks since the main gate last opened, so you'll need a side entrance."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_02","Main gate's locked down, so you'll have to get creative."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_03","Main gate's sealed, but I'm sure you can find a way in."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_side_entrance_04","You're not getting in through the main gate, but you'll manage. I have faith in you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_01","Reset the breaker so Masozi can come pick you up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_02","There's a skyfire battery on the roof, but shorting that breaker will shut it down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_03","You need to silence the skyfire on the roof. Reset that breaker."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_skyfire_cutout_04","The roof's got a heavy skyfire presence, but it all runs from that breaker. Shut it down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_01","Yeah? Well I don't care."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_02","Do continue. I'm taking careful notes. Honest and true."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_03","Oh my bleeding heart ... Pack it in and get the mission done!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_start_banter_b_04","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell it to someone who cares. If you can find 'em."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_01","Okay. Get your idle selves up to the roof and we'll get this done."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_02","Roof's not far. You can drag yourselves there, right?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_03","Get up to the roof. We're close to wrapping this up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_to_the_roof_04","Good stuff. Get to the roof and we can bring this thing to a close."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_01","You've done the hard part. Now all you need to do is key the transmission."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_02","Comms-plex is ready to go. Punch it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_03","Comms-plex dish aligned, so let's get this finished with!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmission_begun_04","Good work! Now all that's left is to get that signal out there! Hit it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmitter_01","The traitors have that dish locked down, but it's nothing your data-interrogators can't handle."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmitter_02","You'll need your data-interrogators if you're going to align that dish."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmitter_03","Transmission can't begin until you get that dish aligned. Break out the data-interrogators!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_complex_transmitter_04","Data-interrogators out. You'll need to break the traitors' defences to get that dish aligned."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_01","Traitors have disabled the cooling system at Manufactorum HL-17-36, and the power matrix is heading towards total collapse."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_02","Manufactorum HL-17-36's heading towards a power systems failure, thanks to a bit of heretic sabotage."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_03","The cooling system in Manufactorum HL-17-36's been sabotaged, leaving the power matrix on the brink of collapse."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_one_04","Looks like our heretic friends have disabled the cooling system at Manufactorum HL-17-36. We need to act."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_01","Get in, access the operations array and use the cryonic rods to flush the system. That should bring things under control."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_02","Cryonic rods can flush the system. You'll find some in the control room. They're strictly for emergencies, but I reckon this qualifies, don't you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_03","Reach the control room, access the cryonic rods and put them to work. Preferably before something explodes."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_three_04","If you can reach the control room, you'll be able to access the cryonic rods that'll flush the system. Better work fast."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_01","We're looking at a blackout cascade if the coolant isn't restored, and we can't afford any interruption in production."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_02","Our allies are screaming for the factory's battle tanks, so you're going to restore the coolant and - hopefully - save the day."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_03","If that factory goes dark, we'll lose a key source of war materiel, so the coolant needs restoring. Guess who's doing that?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_briefing_two_04","If that factory goes dark, it'll cost us dearly. We need its Leman Russes, which means you need to get the coolant online."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_01","You need to get your backsides over to the control chamber and grab those cryonic rods."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_02","Head for the control chamber. Once you're there, get the cryonic rods."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_03","Alright, you lot. You need cryonic rods and you're gonna find those in the control chamber."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_first_objective_04","Shift yourselves. You've got to get to the control chamber and get the cryonic rods."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_01","Like a bit of heat ever hurt anyone."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_02","Whinge, whinge, whinge. Stow it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_03","Would you rather be cold? Be careful what you wish for."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_04","Try to act like soldiers for a change, and stow the whinging!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_01","All right, you're here. Get the Ascender in position."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_02","Good work. Get the Ascender going, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_03","That's the Ascender. You know what to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_04","Ascender's dead ahead. Give it a kick and you can be on your way."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_01","Right, we've got another kill target for you down in the Torrent."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_02","I hope you're up for another Kill Mission, because that's what's happening right now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_03","Got a Sanction Redactus mission for you. You get all the good jobs."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_04","All right. This one's a Kill Mission, down in the bowels of the Torrent."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_01","This particular heretic's dug into the Enforcer Station like a swamp tick."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_02","Your target's cowering in the old Enforcer Station, just waiting for you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_03","Target's in the Enforcer Station, squatting in the Water Cartel's old digs."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_04","You're heading to the Enforcer Station, and it'll be fighting all the way."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_01","You'll be going in through the sewers, so I hope you've got watertight boots."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_02","You'll have to get deep into the Courthouse cell blocks to find him. Don't lock yourselves in by mistake."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_03","Intel places the target in the Courthouse cell blocks. Give him the old Steel Legion 'hello' from me, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_04","Navigate the sewers, reach the streets and go knocking on the front door. No need to be fancy."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_01","The Kill Target's holed up in the Blocks on the other side of the Courthouse."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_02","Move through the Courthouse. You're looking for the Blocks."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_03","Keep on through the Courthouse until you hit the Blocks."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_04","You're looking for the Blocks. Ironically enough, your target's using them as his bolt hole."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_01","There it is. The Enforcer Station's dead ahead!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_02","That's your destination. You'll find the target inside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_03","Looks like you've reached the Enforcer Station."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_enforcer_station_04","Enforcer Station in sight. Head on inside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_01","Here they come! Hold out until the Ascender's down!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_02","You're got incoming! Work together to hold 'em off!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_03","Hold out until the Ascender's down. Don't get overrun!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_event_survive_04","The Ascender's coming down. Just hold your ground!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_01","You'll need to make your way up to street level. That means accessing an Ascender."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_02","Can't do anything from down here. Find an Ascender, and take it from there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_03","You'll need an Ascender to reach street level, so keep moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_first_objective_04","You want to get out of the sewers? Find an Ascender."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_01","All right. Press on through the maintenance area."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_02","Head on through maintenance. Not far now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_03","Keep going. This maintenance area means you're on the right path."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_04","Press on through maintenance. There's nothing worth having in here."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_01","All right. You're looking for the panopticon elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_02","The Kill Target's on a different floor. You can reach him via the panopticon elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_03","Should be an elevator close by. You want to be in it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_04","You're on the wrong floor. Find the elevator, sharpish."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_01","All right! Ascender's down! Time to move on."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_02","That's it, Ascender's here. Get up to the streets."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_03","Ascender's down. Time to move."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_stairs_arrived_04","All right! There's your exit. Move! Move! Move!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_01","What do you want? Red carpets and perfumed walkways?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_02","Yeah, I tried to find something with rose petals. No joy."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_03","It's moan, moan, moan with you lot."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_b_04","If you've not got anything mission critical to say, stay off the channel!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_01","Through this hab. Keep up the pace!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_02","Head on straight through this hab!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_03","Fight your way through the hab!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_enforcer_through_hab_04","Making progress. Get through the hab."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_01","You'll have to cut through the assembly line."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_02","You can get access to Smelter Control through the assembly line."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_03","Smelter Control's on the other side of the assembly line."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_assembly_line_04","Pass through the assembly line and make for Smelter Control."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_01","The heretics have disabled the primary smelter at Manufactorum HL-17-36, and we need it working again."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_02","We've got a problem at Manufactorum HL-17-36 - the primary smelter's been disabled."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_03","You're headed to Manufactorum HL-17-36. The primary smelter's been disabled, and I want it functional."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_a_04","You're inbound to Manufactorum HL-17-36 where the heretics have taken the primary smelter offline."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_01","Reports indicate some sort of daemonic infestation is involved. Purge it, and get that smelter online!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_02","I'm hearing that there's a daemonic infestation involved. Sort it out, and get the smelter operational."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_03","I want that smelter operating, and I don't care what you have to kill to make that happen."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_b_04","There's talk of a daemonic intrusion. It's probably true. Doesn't matter - just get that smelter operational!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_01","The Leman Russes produced at HL-17-36 are a vital part of Grendyl's plans, so get to it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_02","HL-17-36 and its Leman Russ production lines are vital, so don't foul this up!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_03","We badly need HL-17-36's Leman Russ battle tanks on the front lines, so take no chances."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_briefing_c_04","We can't have too many Leman Russ battle tanks, so get HL-17-36 back in working order, ASAP."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_01","That's the elevator. Hit the console and get it moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_02","Okay, good work. Get that elevator moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_03","You've reached the elevator. Time to get it in motion."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_call_elevator_04","Elevator's locked off on a lower level. You'll have to call it up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_first_objective_01","Your first stop's the supply elevator. That'll get you deeper into the manufactorum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_first_objective_02","First stop? Supply elevator. It'll get you into the smelter complex proper."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_first_objective_03","You're heading for the supply elevator. It'll get you where you need to go."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_first_objective_04","Make for the supply elevator. It's the fastest way to the smelter complex."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_01","Head straight down through labour oversight."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_02","Keep moving through labour oversight."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_03","You'll find the elevator past labour oversight."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_labour_oversight_04","Head on through labour oversight. Keep the pace up!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_01","You need to the purge the infestation. Look for daemonic growths."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_02","Get that infestation purged. Target the growths."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_03","You need to drive out the daemonic infestation. Give it a taste of violence."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_purge_infestation_04","Infestation sighted. You know what to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_01","That's the smelter - what we came for. Let's wake it up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_02","Okay. That's the smelter. Let's get to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_03","Primary Smelter sighted. Let's cause some trouble."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_04","Smelter sighted. Move in, and let's get this done."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_01","That's it! Smelter's ready to go. Hit the restart!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_02","Corruption's clear! Hit the system reset!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_03","That did it! Now hit the restart to get the thing running proper!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_smelter_working_04","Good work! A simple restart, and we're good to go!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_01","It'll get better further in. You're in one of the vent outflows."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_02","This is one of the vent outflows. It's better in the main facility."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_03","Yeah, yeah, yeah. It'll pass."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_start_banter_b_04","Get to the next section. The air's clearer there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_superstructure_01","Entering smelter superstructure. Look for a way down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_superstructure_02","You're entering the smelter superstructure. Find a way down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_superstructure_03","You'll want to make your way down through the superstructure."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_superstructure_04","This is the smelter complex. The place you want's a bit further down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_use_elevator_01","Okay, elevator's here. Let's move on."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_use_elevator_02","Elevator's in position. Time to get moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_use_elevator_03","Elevator's here. Head down to the smelter complex."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_forge_use_elevator_04","Right. Ride the elevator down into the smelter complex."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_a_01","Hab Dreyko. Move in, but watch your backs."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_a_02","Hab Dreyko sighted. It's a bit of a heretic nest these days, excellencies."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_a_03","Could be a bit of unpleasantness in Hab Dreyko, excellencies. I hope you don't have weak stomachs."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_01","We've got a Phage Tree to poison in Hab Block Laranax. "
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_02","Tonight, you're indulging a bit of anti-hydroponics: killing the Phage Tree in Hab Block Laranax."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_03","The Phage Tree in Hab Block Laranax needs to die, and you need to kill it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_01","That means getting up to the minute data on the current iteration of the Blight to facilitate the creation of what Magos Kharib calls a ""blessed unguent of shriving"". Don't ask me. That's what I was told."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_02","That being the case, we need what I'm told is a ""blessed unguent of shriving"". Which in turn means that we need current data on the Phage Tree's Blight. That comes first."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_03","The tree's always in flux, which means the Blight's always evolving. If we get data on the latter, we can craft a blessed unguent of shriving - whatever that is - to nobble the former."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_01","Oh ... And we've got oversight from Tertium's noble houses for the duration. Lucky old us."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_02","Some of tertium's nobility have wangled their way into this one. Try to ignore them. I wish I could."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_03","You've got the easy job. I've got to play nice with some of Tertium's nobility. Rannick's idea. Bastard."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_d_01","Maybe take that up with Interrogator Rannick. I'm sure he'll have an opinion."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_d_02","Above my pay grade that, excellency. Why don't you speak to Rannick?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_d_03","Sorry, but that ain't on my mission docket. You'll need to speak with Rannick."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_01","Right. Get your servo-skull out and get me those samples."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_02","This is your scan zone. Deploy your servo-skull and get me some nice samples."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_03","Scan zone reached. Deploy your servo-skull and be careful what you touch."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_b_01","Yeah. You've got a good eye. Time to move on, team."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_b_02","What she said. Get moving. I'll get these samples to Magos Kharib."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_b_03","You heard the lady. Move on to Hab Block Laranax. "
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_c_01","Keep the vox clear, would you? Righteous indignation only gums things up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_c_02","Do you mind, excellency? I'm trying to run a mission here."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_c_03","If we could keep the chatter to a minimum? Operational discipline, and all that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_a_01","That's not a happy tree. Nicely done. Now get moving while you can."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_a_02","If I were a betting man I'd say that the Phage Tree isn't gone for good, but I'll settle for ""today""."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_a_03","Phage Tree's had it, at least for now. That makes us done here ... at least for now. Get moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jam_clear_a_01","That did the trick. As you were."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jam_clear_a_02","Looking good. Injection underway."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jam_clear_a_03","We're back on track. Good work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jam_clear_a_04","Probe's up and running again. "
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jam_clear_a_05","Don't know what you did, but it's working now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jam_clear_a_06","Probe's looking happier now. Back to the war."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jammed_a_01","Probe's stalled. Sort it out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jammed_a_02","The probe's stalled. Needs a bit of help."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jammed_a_03","Can't you see that probe's jammed?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jammed_a_04","Probe's jammed. Give it a thump, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jammed_a_05","Got a jammed probe! Fix it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_jammed_a_06","You gonna sort that probe or what?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_survive_a_01","Right. Hang tight until the injection cycle is complete. Don't get killed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_survive_a_02","Hold station while the biotic probes do their thing."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_survive_a_03","Secure the area. This ain't done until the biotic probes have finished."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_a_01","Auspex is showing hostiles. Let's show our observers what you've got."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_a_02","Hab Block Laranax. And hostiles inbound. Let's put on a good show, team."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_a_03","Strike team? Auspex is picking up hostiles inside. Let's do this proper, you hear?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_01","Right. This quarantine zone should be familiar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_02","You're approaching the quarantine zone. Stay alert."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_03","The quarantine zone looks as welcoming as always."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_b_02","I'm sure the team values your insight, excellency."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_b_03","Can't speak to that, excellency. Maybe you should take it up with Rannick or Zola? They're always happy to talk."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_e_01","Is all that sorted? Good. Because I've got a mission to run."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_e_02","All friends now, are we? How nice."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_e_03","I'm glad that's sorted. Back to the war."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_01","The heretics have seized a Comms-Plex up in one of the spires."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_02","The heretics are busy broadcasting some kind of mind-altering signal from a Comms-Plex."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_03","A Comms-Plex is in enemy hands, and broadcasting a stream of heretic gabble across the hive."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_a_04","You'll be storming a Comms-Plex and putting an end to the heretics' broadcast."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_01","Not sure what's in this signal, but it's sending folk mad, and we've enough of that already."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_02","Rannick says the signal is feeding the heresy on a spiritual level. Whatever that means, it's bad."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_03","Rannick wants the signal shut down. Reckons it's recruiting the citizens on an unconscious level. Can't have that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_b_04","The signal might just seem like nonsense to you, but apparently it's some kind of mind-altering carrier wave."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_01","We'll drop you in the next district over. Get that signal shut down, whatever it takes."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_02","Enemy action means you've got a ways to walk before you get there. When you do, shut it down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_03","The place is swarming with enemies, so it's another non-optimal approach. Doesn't matter. Shut it down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_briefing_c_05","Enemies are everywhere, so you're taking the scenic route. Shut that signal down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_01","So far, so good. Time to bypass the consulate security."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_02","You'll need to bypass security to proceed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_03","Get security bypassed and press on into the consulate."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_bypass_security_04","Security's locked down, but you can disable the worst of it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_01","You need to reach the transmission site and break the daemon's influence."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_02","Okay. You need to reach the heart of the complex."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_03","Time to purge the daemon from the heart of the complex - but you need to get there first."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_complex_heart_04","Press on to the complex heart. Quick as you can."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_01","Keep moving through the consulate. You need to be outside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_02","All right. Straight through the consulate and into the open air."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_03","You need to get outside. There's nothing of note in here."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_consulate_04","Head for the open air. That's where you'll find your vent access."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_01","Looks like the daemon doesn't want you here. Destroy the daemonic growths to align the bridge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_02","The daemon's rotated the bridges. Destroying the daemonic growths should fix that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_03","Get the bridge back in position! Destroy those daemonic growths!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_align_bridges_04","Destroy the daemonic growths and you should have yourselves a bridge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_01","Okay, same drill as before: destroy the daemonic growths."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_02","Come on. Come on. Destroy those daemonic growths!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_03","New bridge, same deal. Get on with it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_next_bridge_04","What are you waiting for? Get that bridge moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_01","Good work! Now get the dish realigned to cut the signal."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_02","Nicely done! Controls should respond now. Cut the signal!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_03","Finally! Now cut the signal!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_end_04","The daemon's retreating! Cut that signal!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_01","All right, here we go! Destroy the daemonic growths to stop the signal."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_02","To stop the signal, you need to realign the dish. Break the daemon's hold!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_03","Kill those daemonic growths, and the dish should realign!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_corruptor_event_stop_signal_start_04","Destroy the daemonic matter and get that dish realigned!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_01","To reach the Comms-Plex you're gonna need to access the hangar ventilation system."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_02","Getting to the Comms-Plex means accessing the hangar ventilation system."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_03","There's no direct route to the Comms-Plex, but the hangar ventilation system will get you there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_first_objective_04","You're going to access the hangar ventilation system. That's what'll get you to the Comms-Plex."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_01","That's it! Now get your lazy arses into the vent tunnel."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_02","Okay, vent tunnel's open. Get moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_03","Vent tunnel's wide open. In you go!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_end_04","Power restored and the path is clear. Good work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_01","That's your access point. You need to power it up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_02","Ventilation access point's out of power. Get it sorted."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_03","Ventilation access is running low on power. You can fix that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_luggable_event_start_04","Get the Ventilation access powered up. Smartly now!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_01","This is it. Time to go to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_02","You're at the Comms-Plex? Took you long enough."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_03","This is the Comms-Plex. Get yourselves inside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_nearing_transmission_complex_04","Got here in the end, anyway."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_01","Ain't like you're gonna be here long, one way or the other."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_02","Don't care for it myself. Not greasy enough."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_03","Yeah? Enjoy it while you can, is my advice."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_b_04","Keep it down. Some of us are trying to run a mission."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_01","Should be able to see the transmitter soon."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_02","You're on the right path. Keep an eye out for the transmission dish."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_03","Transmitter should be in sight soon. That's where you're going."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_propaganda_transmission_dish_04","Transmitter's up ahead. Keep up the pace."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_a_01","We've followed up on the source of the Blighted Stimms and wouldn't you know it's an Obscura Den down in the Carnival."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_a_02","Right. We've traced the source of the Blighted Stimms to an Obscura Den out in the Carnival. Guess where you're going?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_a_03","Strike Team intel has traced the Blighted Stimm production to an Obscura Den deep in the heart of the Carnival. Big surprise, but them's the breaks."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_b_01","I wouldn't expect a warm welcome. Like it or not, the Moebians have that place locked down good and proper."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_b_02","Make no mistake: this is the heart of enemy territory. Every man's hand, tentacle or unidentifiable appendage will be against you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_b_03","Don't expect much in the way of help down there. Seems the Moebians have the entire district pacified. It's traitors as far as the eye can see."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_c_01","This is an intel mission, with a side order of spiteful destruction. Get me whatever you can on their operation, then smash whatever comes to hand."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_c_02","We can't cut the stimm supply, but we can learn from their operation. So get in, have a poke around and grab me some juicy intel."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_briefing_c_03","Cutting the stimm supply is out of the question, but we can gather intel for future operations. Get me something we can use. Got it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_city_view_b_01","As you say, sir."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_city_view_b_02","Yeah, it's a real delight, sir."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_city_view_b_03","Not quite how I'd have put it, sir."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_closer_a_01","Yeah. You're going the right way."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_closer_a_02","This looks good to me."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_closer_a_03","Keep on keeping on. You're heading the right way."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_closer_c_01","Call it a hunch, sir."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_closer_c_02","My nose never lies."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_closer_c_03","Just going with my gut, sir."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_01","Now that looks like a nice, brittle wall."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_02","Nice wall they've got there. Let's make it into a door."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_03","Slap a detpack on that wall, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_b_01","Still, the strike team came through alive. Never doubted them."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_b_02","Looks like the team's still breathing - just about - so it could be worse."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_b_03","Team's still breathing, heretics are dead. Not the worst outcome."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_b_01","I'll have word with Hadron after the mission. Lucky me."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_b_02","No-good second rate cast-off tech. It's a wonder anything works."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_b_03","I've told you sir, this junk's always falling apart."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_a_01","Yeah. That's the place. You know what to do, team."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_a_02","There we go. Just like I said. Time to make an entrance."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_a_03","That's the one we're looking for. I'll bet Melk's head on it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_c_01","Already forgotten, sir."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_c_02","Yeah. It's like I do this for a living, ain't it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_c_03","I have my ways, sir. Wouldn't be much use to you otherwise."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_first_event_start_a_01","Hang about, there's something funny going on here-- [static]"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_first_event_start_a_02","Hold up, you lot. I think we've got a problem-- [static]"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_first_event_start_a_03","Throne, what's wrong with the bloody thing now--? [static]"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_gas_a_01","I bet that gas don't tickle. You'll need to vent the system."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_gas_a_02","Tox gas? That's takes me back. You'd better vent the system."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_gas_a_03","Vent the system if you don't want to be coughing up your lungs!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_hurry_a_01","Pick up your feet. I want this over with."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_hurry_a_02","Keep the pace up! The interrogator's watching!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_hurry_a_03","Sorry about the pace, sir. They're really milking this mission."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_inside_a_01","Keep moving. The good stuff will be hidden deep."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_inside_a_02","You won't find what we're looking for out here. You need to go deeper."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_inside_a_03","Fight your way to the lower levels. Come on, move it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_b_01","Yeah. Let's do something about that sealed door."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_b_02","You can't go any further until you get that door open."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_den_locked_door_b_03","Door's in the way? What a shame. You know what to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_first_objective_a_01","Let's find that Obscura Den. Move with a purpose - the boss is watching."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_first_objective_a_02","Let's not keep the good interrogator waiting. Find that Obscura Den."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_first_objective_a_03","You should find the Obscura Den deeper in. Let's show the interrogator our best side, yeah?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_force_field_a_01","You ain't gonna let a refractor field stop you, are you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_force_field_a_02","Get that field shut down so you can get to the genesis chamber."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_force_field_a_03","That refractor field's gonna have to go. Impress me."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_01","Data says we've got a stimm genesis chamber on site. Smash it, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_02","I'm seeming mention of a genesis chamber nearby. Break it to pieces."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_genesis_chamber_a_03","Data has a stimm genesis chamber near your location. You know what to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_a_01","Looks like the heretics are working on a grander scale than we thought."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_a_02","Looks to me like the heretics have the whole district working for them."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_a_03","These have the look of worker barracks. Not all heretics carry guns."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_01","Keep it moving. Don't give the heretics time to rouse the facility."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_02","You looking to get overwhelmed? Keep it moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_03","Don't dawdle. If this whole place wakes up you'll be goners."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_01","Don't needle the strike team, sir. You'll make me redundant."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_02","He's got a point, team. Pick up your damn feet!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_03","They've got a death wish, I reckon. Incurable, more's the pity."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_03_a_01","Can't be far now. I'd hate for you to die on the brink of success."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_03_a_02","I reckon you're almost there. It's not like the heretics are dying to defend nothing."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_03_a_03","Keep it up. Shouldn't be long now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_01","Another mission done with, and all under the interrogator's scrutiny. Let's call it a day, shall we?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_02","Rannick seems impressed, so you can't have done too badly. Let's get you out of there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_03","Another mission sorted. Not that I had any doubts I'll admit to after the fact. Get to extraction."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_01","What can I say? It's a gift."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_02","Yeah. What a bleeding shame."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_03","If in doubt, leave it all in pieces. That's how we do it on Armageddon."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_a_01","At last. Get your servo-skull out. She'll sniff out the good stuff for you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_a_02","Here we go. The heart of the operation. Set your servo-skull loose and grab me that intel."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_a_03","This place should be a gold mine. Your servo-skull will ident intel caches. You can do the rest."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_01","You've got everything worth having. Let's take those synthesizers offline as a parting gift."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_02","Intel gathering's done. Be a shame to leave all these synthesizers operational, wouldn't it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_03","We've got the intel. Now let's make a mess. Can't hurt to slow the stimm production a bit."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_new_a_01","Solid data-haul. Why don't you murder some heretics while I take a look?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_new_a_02","Lot of data to pick over. Head deeper in while I give it a look."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_new_a_03","You lot entertain yourselves. I need to look this data over."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_01","I reckon this place has been running since before the invasion."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_02","Can't be sure, but I think this place predates the invasion."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_03","Something stinks about this. This place has been here for years."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_01","It's the best life in the Imperium. Did you want something, sir?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_02","Yeah. It's a day like any other. Can I help you, interrogator?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_03","Never a dull moment. Can I help you, sir?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_01","If you say so. Always helps a mission go smoothly, eyes staring into the back of your head."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_02","Yeah, okay. We're always the better for someone peering over our shoulders."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_03","Is that right? I'm sure that won't be a distraction in any way."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_streets_b_01","Nothing's certain, but data from other Strike Teams and Wyrmwood agents all agree."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_streets_b_02","If it ain't, then we'll give some bootlegger the fright of his or her miserable life, won't we?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_raid_streets_b_03","I'm sure the Emperor would let us know if it wasn't, sir."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_01","We're running low on some of our more exotic ammunition supplies. You're going to fix that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_02","Can't fight a war without ammo - especially the good stuff. But we're running low of the latter."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_03","Wars are won and lost on supplies, and we're dangerously low of the more 'unusual' sorts of ammunition."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_04","Special issue ammo's running a bit thin, so it's time to replenish the reserves."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_01","Lucky for us, the heretics have plenty we can borrow. It's waiting for you at the Chasm Station Logistratum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_02","Turns out the Scabs diverted a shipment to the Chasm Station Logistratum, which makes things easier for us."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_03","Scabs have plenty at the Chasm Station Logistratum - that's what happens with a whole Militarum regiment behind you. We're going to nick theirs."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_b_04","We're going to borrow some from the Scabs. You'll find the motherlode at the Chasm Station Logistratum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_01","You're going to sneak in, secure the area and load the goods onto a valkyrie before extracting. Are we clear?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_02","Get inside, secure the landing bay and load the goods onto a valkyrie. Then you can leave."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_03","Once you're inside, I'll send a valkyrie to carry anything worth stealing. Should be simple enough."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_briefing_c_04","Assuming you can get inside, you should have your pick of the Scabs' supplies. Valkyries will handle cargo duty."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_01","You're heading down, but the elevator's bust. You'll figure something out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_02","Elevator's shot, so you'll have to get down there the hard way."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_03","Down you go. Mind your step!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_descend_shaft_04","You're heading downwards. It's a big old drop, so watch your footing."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_01","That's a good call. Get it done."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_02","It's like you're getting better at this. Approved."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_03","Good idea. See this? This is my proud face."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_b_04","That's good. Make it happen."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_01","Okay! Time to grab that ammunition!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_02","Marking the ammunition crates! Go get them!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_03","Ammunition crates marked! Grab them!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_event_grab_supplies_04","Time to grab that ammunition!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_first_objective_01","You'll be going in the back way, so make your way to the maintenance tunnels."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_first_objective_02","You'll need to make your way to maintenance - we're not knocking on the front door."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_first_objective_03","Get moving. You'll breach the Logistratum via maintenance."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_first_objective_04","You'll need maintenance access first of all. Let's move out!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_01","Okay. You're at the maintenance access. Your data-interrogator can spring that door."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_02","Maintenance access is sealed. Use your data-interrogator to fix that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_03","Maintenance access is locked up tight. Time to use your data-interrogator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_hack_access_door_04","Sealed up tight. Looks like a job for your data-interrogator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_logistratum_01","Good work, you're at the Logistratum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_logistratum_02","You're in the Logistratum now. Let's get to it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_logistratum_03","Logistratum seems mostly intact. That's good and bad."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_logistratum_04","This is the Logistratum. Loading bay won't be far."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_lower_track_01","Almost there. Get down to the Supply Track. Logistratum access is at the far end."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_lower_track_02","You want to be on the Supply Track. That's where you'll find Logistratum access."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_lower_track_03","If you can get down to the Supply Track you'll find Logistratum access at the far end."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_lower_track_04","Not far now. Reach the Supply Track and follow it to the Logistratum."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_01","You're making progress. Cross the repair bay and keep on through the Subrails."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_02","Halfway through. Cross over the repair bay and keep following the Subrails."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_03","That's it. Once you're through the repair bay you've got another stint in the Subrails."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_maintenance_bay_04","There's another Subrail area beyond this repair bay, but you're on the right path."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_refectory_01","You're in the Refector's Quarter. Means you're on the right path."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_refectory_02","You're passing through the Refector's Quarter. It's not far to the station."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_refectory_03","Press on through the Refector's Quarter - you'll be at the station soon enough."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_refectory_04","Looks like the Refector's Quarter. The station's just ahead."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_01","You do know what 'infiltrate' means, right?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_02","Thought we'd at least start this one off stealthy."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_03","It's an infiltration mission. What did you expect?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_start_banter_b_04","Oh, I'm sorry. We'll drop you bang on a Scab fortress next time."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_station_approach_01","Like I said, we're not heading into the station proper. Hang a right up ahead."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_station_approach_02","Regular warzone, ain't it? You can get to maintenance over on the right."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_station_approach_03","Can't get into the station, even if that was a good idea. Maintenance access is off to the right."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rails_station_approach_04","Pick your way through the rubble and find a way down to maintenance."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_aegis_sighted_a_01","That's the aegis station. Move with a purpose!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_aegis_sighted_a_02","Aegis station sighted. Move your feet!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_aegis_sighted_a_03","Aegis station in sight. Get ready."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_01","Head on past Archivum Sycorax. Don't drop the pace."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_02","Archivum Sycorax on your right. That's business for another time."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_03","Stay clear of Archivum Sycorax. Reports say it's in heretic hands."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_archive_a_04","Archivum Sycorax is to your right. You're heading straight on."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_01","See? The bridge is down. Didn't need any of that whining, did you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_02","Skylink's in position. Move out!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_03","Skylink's locked into position. You can get moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_down_04","Skylink's down. Head into Enclavum Baross."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_01","Alright. Took you long enough to reach the Bridge of Many Martyrs, but you're there now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_02","You're at the Bridge of Many Martyrs. The Aegis Station's just beyond."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_03","I see you're at the Bridge of Many Martyrs. Push on to the Aegis Station."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_a_04","Pick up the pace! Cross the Bridge of Many Martyrs to the Aegis Station!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_01","That Skylink's gonna have to come down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_02","Unless you can fly, you're gonna need to lower the Skylink."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_03","Skylink's in isolation config. But you can handle that. I've got faith in you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_a_04","Skylink's in isolation config. Can't blame 'em for trying."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_01","Okay, seems the heretics have got themselves a foothold up in Throneside. It's a bloody liberty."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_02","The heretics are pushing into Throneside, and I'm thinking we can't be allowing that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_03","We've got heretic infiltrators tearing up Throneside, and Rannick's chewing my ear off about getting it fixed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_a_04","We've had reports of heretics up in Throneside. I want them evicted. Got it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_01","Of course, it's never just one place we're worried about, but this mission's centred on Enclavum Baross."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_02","You're headed for Enclavum Baross - one of the worst affected areas."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_03","You'll be heading into Enclavum Baross, though as normal we'll have to put you down a ways off."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_b_04","Once Masozi's dropped you off, you'll be heading into Enclavum Baross."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_01","Get over there, capture the old Aegis Station and hold it until we can send more bodies in. Get it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_02","There's an old Aegis Station on the district edge. Get inside and hold it until I can send in a garrison."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_03","Once you're in, look for the Aegis Station. If we capture that, we're golden."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_brief_c_04","You're to get the Aegis Station back in our hands. Gives us a base of operations, even if we can't hold it forever."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","No bellyaching! Just get it done!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","I don't want to hear complaints. Just lots of soothing screaming!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_01","Alright. Keep moving until you reach the Skylink. That's a big bridge, to you and me."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_02","The Skylink's your first port of call. Look for a big bridge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_03","These enclavums are separated by Skylink bridges, so that's your first port of call."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_first_objective_04","Head for the Skylink bridge. You can cross into Enclavum Baross from there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_01","Right, let's keep up the pace. The Aegis Station's still a good way off."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_02","It's still a good walk to the Aegis Station, so keep moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_03","You're not at the Aegis Station yet are you? No? So why are you slacking off?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_keep_moving_04","Keep going. I want that Aegis Station in our hands yesterday. You hear?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_01","Stone dead. Find some power cells. Give it a boost."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_02","Power's out. Looks for some power cells."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_03","Dead, but we can work around that. Look for some power cells."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_power_bridge_04","And of course the motor's out. See if you can find some power cells."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_01","Right! Now for the sticky part! I want that Aegis Station!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_02","Secure the Aegis Station, and I don't want to hear any moaning!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_03","The Aegis Station is yours for the taking, so get to it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_secure_the_aegis_04","Get that Aegis Station secured! Double time!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_01","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep it moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_02","Enough yakk. Let's get to business."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_03","You're not here to sightsee ... or had you forgotten?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_b_04","Stay alert ... if you think you can manage that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_01","There he is, Lord Militant Ennic Baross, hero of Atoma."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_02","That's Baross. This whole enclavum's named for him."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_03","Ennic Baross, or at least his statue. Named this district for him."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_statue_baross_04","Lord Militant Ennic Baross was the saviour of Atoma at one time. Our turn now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_statue_riga_consora_a_01","That's Militant General Riga Consora. Not a nice lady, by all accounts."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_statue_riga_consora_a_02","See that? Militant General Riga Consora. She was a piece of work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_statue_riga_consora_a_03","Riga Consora, Scourge of Heretics. You'd have liked her."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_streets_a_01","Nothing like a stroll where you're not wanted, is there?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_streets_a_02","The citizenry are staying under cover. Can't blame them for that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_resurgence_streets_a_03","I hope the inhabitants have got nice, strong locks on their doors."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_01","Sneaking in, stealing ill-gotten gains ... makes me feel like a hive ganger ..."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_02","Stealing from thieves? This is hive ganger work ... I used to be a soldier ..."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_03","Don't any of you lot get ideas from this. We're still an army ... even if this ain't exactly by the book."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_04","There's going to come a day when we get to have a straight fight with the heretics. Not today. Today, we're thieves."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_01","Looks like you lot are having fun. Makes me wish I wasn't stuck behind the mission terminal."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_02","You lot don't know how good you've got it. A gun, a swarm of heretics and no datawork to sign off. I dream of that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_03","Wish I were down there with you, I really do. Anything to get me away from all this datawork Melk insists on."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_one_a_04","Fighting through the belly of a hive city? Takes me back to when I was a proper soldier, not a glorified scribe in a greatcoat."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_01","You lot slowing down? Still, serves us right for recruiting a bunch of rejects, don't it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_02","Come on, come on! Move like you're soldiers! Or at least like you could pass for soldiers if the lights were out and the enemy were out of their heads!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_03","You lot had better shape up. Just because I'm not on the front line no more doesn't mean I mean to go soft on slackers. Move it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_three_a_04","Get your idle feet moving! The Emperor's watching you, and so am I! Between you and me, I'm the one you want to worry about."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_01","These Moebians know their way around here too well. There's something else going on, mark my words."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_02","I'm sick and tired of the Moebians treating Tertium's underbelly like their own private transit route. We'll have to do something about that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_03","All these Moebians, scurrying about in the walls like scav-rats. Makes me think we've a bigger problem than anyone knows."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_banter_two_a_04","These heretics get everywhere. Always do. Thankfully, we've always got the solution, don't we? Burn the karkers out!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_01","Looks like that blast gate's sealed. Find out what's keeping it closed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_02","Blast gate ain't responding. Find and clear the obstruction."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_03","The blast gate won't open! Deal with it, if you want to get out of there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_blast_gate_a_04","Something's jammed the blast gate mechanism. You know what to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_01","Moebian 6th command are planning a pay-off to their co-conspirators in one of Chasm Station's Transit Hubs."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_02","The Moebian 6th ain't working alone. We don't yet know the ""who"" but we know there's a pay-off happening."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_03","The Moebian 6th have got fellow allies and informants up and down Tertium, and today's payday."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_04","The Moebians are due to pay-off some of their co-conspirators. The exchange is happening in a Chasm Station Transit Hub."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_01","Said payment's taking the form of prismata crystals. Worthless to you, but handy if you're manufacturing heavy weapons."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_02","The score's worthless to you, unless you've a manufactorum that can stamp out unusual las weapons."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_03","The prismata crystals ain't exactly common currency, but I hear they're just the thing for focusing some types of las weaponry."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_04","Hadron says the prismata crystals are useless unless you've got the tech-smarts, so don't even think about snaffling them."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_01","So why don't you get down there and grab me that pay-off? That's a rhetorical question, in case you were wondering."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_02","We can put that pay-off to better use, so I want you to go and get it for me. Understand?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_03","We've a chance to drive a wedge between the Moebians and their allies, so get in, grab the pay-off and get out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_04","Can't hurt to have the Moebians and their allies giving each other the leery eye, so grab the pay-off and get out. Right?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_01","Looks like someone abandoned a perfectly good tank. Wouldn't have happened in my regiment."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_02","Pity that tank ain't operational. They're called ""Demolishers"" for a reason."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_03","Leaving perfectly good tanks in heretic hands? No wonder Atoma's going to the dogs."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_demolisher_a_04","Someone abandoned a perfectly good Leman Russ? Can't trust these no-hopers."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_elevator_monologue_a_01","Oh, look at all those smiling faces. Cheer up. If you were on Armageddon, most of you would be heroes of the Endless War by now. Which means you'd be stone dead. Makes you think, don't it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_elevator_monologue_a_02","Hard to be certain, but I reckon you're making good time. Couldn't hurt to pick up the pace, though. Ain't as though you want to show up during the exchange. Might get a little bit too exciting, even for you lot."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_elevator_monologue_a_03","Still alive? That's what I like to see. Dead soldiers don't win wars, do they? Well, not unless you strap 'em to the barricades and use 'em for ablative armour. Which is always an option if you don't come through for me."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_elevator_monologue_a_04","Between you and me, Grendyl ain't sure about you lot, but I talked him 'round. So don't you go letting me down, do you hear? My nasty side ain't something you want to see ... up close, or at a distance. Keep that in mind, why don't you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_01","Right, that's it. Grab the pay-off and let's get you out of there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_03","Time to leave. Grab the pay-off and get moving! Extraction's waiting!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_04","That's it! Get out of there before reinforcements arrive ... And don't leave the pay-off behind!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_01","Throne! Looks like you've got something daemonic jamming up the works!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_02","Reading infestation in your area. You'll have to clear it to proceed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_03","That's not a tech-failure. One of the heretics' little pets must be jamming things up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_04","I knew this was going too well. You'd better eliminate whatever's jamming things up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_01","Right. That should get things moving. Someone hit the switch."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_02","There you go. Someone give the switch a thump, see if it works."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_03","You should be clear now. Better get the Riser moving again."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_a_04","That ought to do it. Let's get this show moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_01","There we go. Let's get moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_02","Job's done. You know what to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_a_03","Smartly done. Now let's get this finished."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_01","Good work. Just hold fast and you'll be out of there in no time."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_02","That's it. You're moving. Won't be long now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_03","It's moving is it? Well, well, well."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_a_04","Still works? Never can be certain about stuff down there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_01","Right, we're here and so's the pay-off. Don't worry about it for now. Your way out's a couple of levels up, so you need to get the Ascension Riser moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_02","See the pay-off? We got here in time after all. All you've got to do is kick the Ascension Riser into gear, then you can grab what we came for and extract."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_03","Pay-off's still here. Good. Get the Ascension Riser moving, then you can grab the goodies and get out of there. But they ain't gonna let you go easily."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_end_event_start_a_04","There's the pay-off. If you want out of there, get that Ascension Riser in motion. Once you're at the right level, you can grab what we came for and head out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_01","Looks like you're clear. Release the access gate and head for the Transit Hub."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_02","Job's done. Hit the access gate release and proceed through the depot."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_03","Path's clear. Just need to hit the gate release and you can get moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_a_04","You're good to get going. Look for the access gate release."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_01","Right. You need to be on the other side, which means moving the trains. You'll need power cores to trip the track lockout, then set a data-interrogator to do the rest."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_02","Looks like those trains are in the way. Look for power cores to trip the track lockout. Once that's done, your data-interrogator can get the trains moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_03","You're at the wrong end of the siding. Shifting those trains out of the way means tripping the lockout capacitors with power cores, then having your data-interrogator handle the train itself."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_04","You can't get any further without moving those trains. Find some power cores to trip the lockout capacitors, then set your data-interrogator to work. You got that?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_01","Capacitor's tripped. Get your data-interrogator in place, sharpish!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_02","The power's flowing again. Time to get your data-interrogator working."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_03","About time. Get your data-interrogator in position!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_04","It's data-interrogator time. Don't hang about - get it done."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_objective_a_01","Right. Head for the maintenance siding. You can reach the Transit Hub from there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_objective_a_02","Proceed to the maintenance siding. The Transit Hub's just beyond."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_objective_a_03","First waypoint's the maintenance siding. Then you can press on to the Transit Hub."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_objective_a_04","You're already behind. Get to the maintenance siding! Double-time!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_01","You'll be glad to know there's no power to these tracks."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_02","Power's off, so don't be squeamish about treading the tracks."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_03","Tracks are reading as offline, so it looks like we've got us a road."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_a_04","The tracks ain't powered, in case you were wondering."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_01","They're going to keep coming, so you'd better get going."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_02","They're not going to let up. Get your arses moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_03","Get out of there before you're overwhelmed!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_keep_coming_a_04","There's no end to these heretics. Get clear while you can!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_maze_a_01","You'll have to find your own path. Use your initiative."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_maze_a_02","My maps are out of date. Trust your judgement and find your own path."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_maze_a_03","Better keep moving. We're on a clock."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_maze_a_04","Making progress, but would it kill you to pick up the pace?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_01","You can cross here. Mind your step. Wouldn't want accidents, would we?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_02","This should get you across. My advice? Don't look down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_03","Looks like you've got a crossing point. You waiting for an invitation?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_a_04","Cross the void and be quick about it! We're falling behind!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_siding_a_01","The maintenance siding's just up ahead."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_siding_a_02","Almost at the maintenance siding. Keep it moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_siding_a_03","You not at the siding yet? Emperor give me strength!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_siding_a_04","Come on, come on! Why aren't you at the siding yet?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_start_a_01","Recon suggests we got here before the Moebians' partners. That's good. Means fewer heretics between you and the pay-off. Get moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_start_a_02","You on site yet? Recon reports that we've beaten the co-conspirators to the punch. Should just be you, the Moebians and some much needed bloodletting."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_start_a_03","Deep recon confirms that the Moebian half of the pay-off's in place. If you don't want to fight half the hive, I'd get there before the others show up."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_start_a_04","About time. The Moebians are already on site with the pay-off. If you get there too late? Well, don't bother coming back. Am I understood?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_01","Right, almost there. Get yourselves through the depot. The Transit Hub's just beyond."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_02","Not far now. Press on through the depot."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_03","You made up some time back there. Get yourselves to the Transit Hub."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_through_depot_a_04","The Transit Hub's just past this depot. Move your carcasses, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_01","You'll have to navigate the tracks. Don't be all day about it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_02","The tracks should take you right there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_03","Keep to the tracks and you won't get lost."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_rise_tracks_two_a_04","Follow the tracks, but don't fall into the subrails, got it?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_final_01","I reckon you've hit paydirt. Get scanning."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_final_02","This is what we've been chasing. Begin scan."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_final_03","This is what we've been looking for. Get to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_final_04","At last ... This is what we came for. Get scanning."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_final_05","This is what we're looking for. Now get me a nice, fat juicy scan."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_new_target_01","Reading another likely scan target."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_new_target_02","We've got another scan target."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_new_target_03","Scan target close by."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_new_target_04","Got a scan target, real close."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scan_new_target_05","Scan target's close. Get to it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_05","The Heretics are using one of the old Excise Vaults to store samples of their latest contagion, and Rannick wants one for study."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_06","The Heretic scum are storing samples of their latest contagion in the old Excise Vaults. Can't have that, can we?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_07","You're off to Sector Periferus to crack an Excise Vault, and get me a sample of the Heretics' latest contagion."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_one_08","There's an Excise Vault in Sector Periferus that's loaded with the Heretics' latest concoction. Get it for me."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_01","Once you've got the samples, send them our way using the pneumatic conveyor, then extract. Got that?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_02","Send me the samples via the old pneumatic conveyor, then- and not before - you can come home."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_03","You can use the old pneumatic conveyor to get the samples out. Then you can find your own exit."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_three_04","There's a pneumatic conveyor in the Vault complex. Use it to get the samples out, then you're free to leave."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_01","You'll need to access a servitor colony to get today's cypher-ident. From there, you can crack the Vault."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_02","You'll get access cypher-idents from the nearby servitor colony. After that, getting into the Vault should be child's play."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_03","There's a barely functional servitor colony that can get you a cypher-ident. Then you can try for the Vault itself."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_briefing_two_04","To get into the Vault, you'll need a cypher-ident … and for that, you'll need to brute force access to a servitor colony."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_01","Just watch your backs up there. This is where the heretics first appeared. You can be sure they'll defend it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_02","The heretics are crawling all over this sector, so less of the basking and move with a purpose, you hear?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_03","Admire the view while you can. This is a heretic stronghold, so you ain't gonna spend much time seeing the sights."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_response_04","Never seen the appeal of fresh air, myself. Rots the lungs. So you'll want this over quickly, won't you?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_01","Alright. You need to extract idents from the servitor colony, then crack the Vault security. You can do this!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_02","Vault's locked down. You need cypher idents from the servitor colony to get past security."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_03","Mission parameters are simple. Get a cypher ident from the servitor colony, crack security and get into the Vault. Get moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_scavenge_first_objective_04","To get past security and access the Vault, you need a cypher ident from the servitor colony. Go! Go! Go!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_a_01","The heretics are using Tertium's railroad network to transport their forces. We can use that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_a_02","Tertium's railroad is under heretic control, but that doesn't mean we can't use it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_a_03","The heretics have Tertium's railroad under lockdown ... almost, anyway."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_a_04","The heretics control Tertium's railroads, but we can make that work for us ... if you're up for it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_b_01","You're going to infiltrate behind enemy lines and redirect a train with a high-value target on board."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_b_02","There's a warlord coming in by train - you're going to redirect it to a platform of our choice."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_b_03","Cross Ascension Bridge, interface with the auto-scheduler and redirect the Sanction Redactus Target's train."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_b_04","The Sanction Redactus Target's travelling by train. You're going to redirect it somewhere he doesn't want to go."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_c_01","After that, make your way into Chasm Terminus proper, and kill the bastard when he arrives."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_c_02","He'll be travelling with bodyguards, sure, but you'll have the advantage of surprise."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_c_03","You'll intercept him at Chasm Terminus. And by 'intercept' I of course mean 'eliminate'."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_briefing_c_04","All goes to plan, you can find the traitor at Chasm Terminus. Then you can kill him."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_01","Contraband lockers. Nothing here for you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_02","Looks like contraband lockers. People will try to smuggle all sorts."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_03","Contraband inspectors always do a brisk trade in places like this."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_contrabrand_lockers_04","Don't even think about raiding those contraband lockers!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_cross_station_01","You're on the wrong side of the station - find a way across!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_cross_station_02","You need to reach the far side of the station."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_cross_station_03","You're in the wrong place. You need to be on the other side!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_cross_station_04","This is the wrong side of the station!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Right. You've come a long way for this. Don't screw it up!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","I want the Sanction Redactus Target dead. Don't you let me down!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_03","If you don't take the target out, don't bother coming back!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_a_04","Game faces on! Make this count!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Cheer up! This is the fun part!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Don't be so gloomy, the good part's just starting!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_03","All those long faces. I thought you liked killing?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_a_04","This should be one to remember!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_01","Yeah, intel's a bit spotty. Sorry."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_02","He's an Arch-heretic, my notes say. That's all they say."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_03","He's someone Rannick wants dead. That'll have to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_b_04","He's nothing you can't handle. I've got faith in you."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_enter_station_01","Okay. This is the place. Find a way in."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_enter_station_02","Expect heavy resistance inside."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_enter_station_03","You'll have a fight on your hands inside. Stay together and stay sharp."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_enter_station_04","Almost there. Proceed through the main hall and keep it together."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_head_to_market_01","Direct route's out of the question, so you'll have to reach the market through the ventilation tunnels."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_head_to_market_02","That's a good start. Next stop: the marketplace. Head through the tunnels."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_head_to_market_03","You can use the ventilation tunnels to reach the marketplace. Move your feet!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_head_to_market_04","The marketplace isn't far. You can get access through the ventilation tunnels."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_01","That's the splice point. Set your data-interrogators to access the auto-scheduler."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_02","Here we go ... Get your data-interrogators placed. Time to change our Sanction Redactus Target's plans."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_03","You're in position. Set your data-interrogators and let's get access to the auto-scheduler."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogate_splice_point_04","Data-interrogators out! We don't have long to spoil our Sanction Redactus Target's day!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_01","Vigilance is the price of survival. It's as simple as that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_02","Innocence is overrated, and we've all seen what happens when heretics flourish."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_03","Enough of that. We've got a job to do."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_b_04","Truth and discipline are what keeps an army marching and a world like Atoma on the straight and narrow."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_01","Move up though the maintenance bay. Not long now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_02","The maintenance bay should lead you to the station approach."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_03","You should see the station once you're through the maintenance bay."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_maintenance_bay_04","You're at the maintenance bay? Good. Keep moving."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_01","Yeah. We've hit a stalemate hereabouts. We hold one side of the bridge, the heretics the other."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_02","This sector's in the balance. All we can do is hold ground. At least for now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_03","It can't all be glory and medals. Everybody serves ... in their way."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_start_banter_b_04","This is a temporary staging area ... at least, that was the plan. Hasn't worked out like that."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_tanks_01","You see that tank guarding the approach? Leman Russ Demolisher. I'd weep for the heretics ... if they weren't heretics."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_tanks_02","Thank Throne for the Leman Russ battle tank. We'd never hold this world without it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_tanks_03","This bridge'll hold as long as we've ammo for the tanks."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_tanks_04","What a Leman Russ Demolisher lacks in range, it makes up for in firepower. It's a beauty, and no mistake."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_01","That's it! We've got access. Upload the new schedule and get moving!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_02","Access granted. Upload the doctored schedule."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_03","Yeah ... We're in. Get that new schedule uploaded."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_station_upload_schedule_04","Looks good from here. Upload the doctored schedule."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_01","Okay, enough with the chatter. Time to reach the silo."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_02","You done yakking? Good. You've got a silo to find."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_03","Time to find that silo. Head on out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bazaar_04","The silo's not far beyond the Bazaar. Move it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_01","Right. Get across the bridge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_02","You're almost at the elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_03","Elevator's not far. Keep going!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_bridge_04","Elevator's close. Try not to fall off the side."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_01","The heretics have decided the best way to win is to disrupt Tertium's water supply."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_02","The heretics have cottoned onto the idea of poisoning Tertium's water supply."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_05","Tertium's water supply's under threat, thanks to our Moebian mates."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_a_06","The Heretics have cooked up another attempt to poison Tertium ... and it starts in the Torrent."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_01","They're pumping filth into the silos, and we know where it's going down."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_02","We've found the source of the poisoning, so you're taking a little trip."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_03","They're pumping filth into the silos, and we can't have that, can we?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_b_04","They're working out of one of the silos and the poison's spreading from there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_01","Get down there. Drive them out, and get the fresh water flowing again."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_02","Get into the silo, send the Heretics packing and get the water supply restored."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_03","Fight your way into the silo and eliminate the Scabs. Hopefully that'll fix the water supply."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_briefing_c_04","Once you reach the silo you can fix this mess and get the water flowing again."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_01","That's the Ragged King's Court, dead ahead. Keep going."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_02","Coming up on the Ragged King's Court."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_03","Cartel HQ's in sight. More than I can say for the Cartel. Heh."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_hq_04","That's Cartel HQ. It's seen better days, but who hasn't?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_01","Good work. That'll take the pressure off Tertium's water supply."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_02","Job's done. We've got clean water flowing again."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_03","Clean water restored. I'll count that as a win."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_clean_water_04","The daemon will be back, but for now this place is back to normal."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_01","Right! Get this place cleared out! Double time!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_02","Send that daemon-filth a message! Destroy the daemonic growths!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_03","Give that daemon a kicking! Destroy the daemonic growths!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_end_event_start_04","Eliminate the daemonic growths. Get the water flowing again!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_01","You need an elevator to reach the lower levels. Make for the Water Cartel headquarters."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_02","You're too high up right now. You'll find an elevator in the Water Cartel headquarters."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_03","You need to reach street level. That means getting to an elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_first_objective_04","You can make your way to the streets via the elevator in Water Cartel HQ."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_flush_01","Okay. Let's get it done. Flush the system and drive out the daemon. Get the water flowing again."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_flush_02","You need to flush the system, but that daemon's gonna fight you. Don't let it win."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_flush_03","Right. Get the system flush underway and drive the daemon out. Come on, move it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_flush_04","Right. First you trigger the system flush, then you drive out the daemon. Go! Go! Go!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_b_01","Tertium couldn't survive without all these pipes. Ain't exactly much water to be had up top."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_b_02","Don't really understand how this place works. Don't have to neither."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_b_03","We don't exactly deal in luxuries on Tertium. What works, works."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_01","Right. Get out of here before the next lot arrive."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_02","Time to move. Head down to the Bazaar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_03","Get inside. Get down to the Bazaar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_end_04","No slacking. Get down to the Bazaar while you can."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_01","There's the elevator. You're gonna get friends as soon as you call it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_02","Get the elevator moving, and be ready to defend yourselves."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_03","The elevator's gonna take time to get here. Get ready for a fight."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_survive_event_start_04","You'll have to hold this landing until the elevator arrives."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_01","One last push! The silo's up ahead."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_02","You're almost at the silo."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_03","Keep moving! The silo's close."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_stockpile_through_to_silo_04","Just a little further..."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_a_05","The Heretics are brewing a pathogen in one of the Hourglass' fuel refineries."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_a_06","Our favourite Heretics are brewing a pathogen in a fuel refinery."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_a_07","Would you believe that the Heretics are brewing a pathogen in an old fuel refinery?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_01","Get access to said refinery via flow control, then build overpressure in the gestation chambers to destroy the pathogen."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_02","You'll gain access via flow control. Once you're inside, build overpressure in the system to destroy the thing."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_03","You can get in through flow control. The pathogen itself can be killed by pressurising the gestation chambers."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_b_04","Start by heading to flow control - you can reach the refinery from there. Then, build pressure to destroy the gestation chambers."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_01","The bad news is that it's all enemy territory, so it might get sticky."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_02","I hear tell that the whole refinery's been taken over, so keep your eyes open."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_03","Did I mention that the refinery's an enemy stronghold? No? Well I have now."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_briefing_c_04","Oh, and the refinery's been fortified by our traitor friends. Do enjoy yourselves."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_01","Almost there, but you need to cross the hangar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_02","Flow Control's just across the hangar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_03","Keep moving. Flow Control's on the other side of the hangar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_cross_hangar_04","Press on across the hangar. Flow Control's not far."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_01","Stay focused! I want that pathogen destroyed!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_02","You can't hurt the daemon. Stick to the plan!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_03","Keep it together! Do you hear me?"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_b_04","Keep to the mission. Get it done!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_01","Door's all gummed up. You'll need to blow your way out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_02","The daemon doesn't want you to leave. Set a demo charge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_03","Looks like you'll have to blast your way out."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_demolish_door_04","You'll need to blast your way clear. Daemonic flesh, meet demo charge."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_01","The elevator's seen better days, but it should work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_02","That elevator's just what you need."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_03","That elevator should take you where you need to go."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_elevator_found_04","Don't dawdle. Get aboard the elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_01","Right! Set data-interrogators on the live incubators to start building the pressure."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_02","Your data-interrogators can override the incubators and get the pressure building."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_03","Get your data-interrogators in place to start building overpressure."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_end_event_start_04","This is a job for your data-interrogators. They'll override the pressure controls."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_first_objective_01","Okay! Time to head to Flow Control. Move yourselves!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_first_objective_02","Enough chatter! Head out to Flow Control!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_first_objective_03","This isn't getting you any closer to Flow Control, so move it!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_first_objective_04","Flow Control isn't far. But you'll have to fight your way in."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_01","Follow the pipes. They'll see you true."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_02","If in doubt, follow the pipes."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_03","The pipes will lead you to Flow Control. Don't get lost."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_follow_pipes_04","Follow the pipes and you won't go far wrong."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_job_done_01","That should keep this particular pathogen out of circulation!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_job_done_02","Good work! You've saved a lot of lives today!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_job_done_03","Nicely done! Couldn't ask for a cleaner result."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_job_done_04","You've done good today. One less plague brewing on Atoma!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_01","Almost there ... Keep to the pipes!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_02","You know the drill ... Follow the pipes!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_03","The pipes'll lead you straight to the refinery!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_keep_following_pipes_04","Stick to the pipes! Almost there!"
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Flow Control's locked down by some kind of heretic ... I don't know. Be ready for anything."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_a_03","I'm hearing Flow Control's got some kind of infestation. You'll have to clear it."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_a_04","Quick warning: the heretics have Flow Control locked down. Might get a bit unpleasant in there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I keep trying to convince Rannick to properly purge this sector."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","We'll be coming back here again and again until this sector's purged. Mark my words."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_03","This sector needs purging. With fire. Lots and lots of fire."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_a_04","Only way to put the heretics down for good is to purge this place with fire."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_01","Right, you've driven the daemon off. Elevator's all yours."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_02","Looks like the daemon's had enough. Now you can use the elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_03","Elevator's working again. Time to head to the refinery."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_complete_04","That's got the elevator working. You can proceed to the refinery."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_01","Throne! Looks like some kind of daemon has burrowed all through this machinery. You'll have to drive it out to proceed."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_02","Something daemonic has a deathgrip on this place. You'll have to drive it off to unlock the elevator."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_03","The heretics have called up some kind of daemon to lock the place down. Drive it off."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_mid_event_start_04","Kill those daemonic extrusions, and you can make your way onwards."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_01","There we go. That's Flow Control."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_02","You've reached Flow Control. Good work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_03","Glad you made it. Now let's get to work."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_flow_control_04","This is Flow Control. Time for the next phase."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_01","You're in the lower hangar. You need to be in the upper hangar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_02","You need to find a way to the upper hangar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_03","Well, you've reached the lower hangar. Shame you need to be in the upper hangar."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_reach_hangar_04","Head to the upper hangar. You can proceed from there."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_01","Yeah, repair crews have given this place a wide berth for years."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_02","Nothing a bit of spit and polish wouldn't fix."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_03","It's not so bad. You should see some of the hives on Armageddon ... those that are left."
"loc_sergeant_a__mission_strain_start_banter_b_04","You want to stay here and tidy up, be my guest."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_01","We're getting reports that things ain't right down there. Daemonic manifestations and the like."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_02","Recon suggests you might be dealing with increased daemonic intrusion down there."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_03","Might want to watch your step. Seems there's daemonic matter all over the place."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_a_04","Don't know if you checked the intel, but there's a good chance of daemonic matter being present."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","Stop coddling them! They can handle this."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","In my day we was always knee-deep in daemons."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","Don't change the job, does it? Get it done."
"loc_sergeant_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","Don't you worry about all that. Stick to the mission and it'll be fine."
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_a_01","We've got rolling blackouts in your area. I hope you like fighting in the dark."
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_a_02","Going to be gloomy down there. Power's out, and half of the lights have gone with it."
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_a_03","Yeah, I hope none of you lot are scared of the dark. Power's out."
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_a_04","I've had reports of blackouts in your area, but I'm sure you'll manage. Just mind your feet, yeah?"
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_b_01","You can bet the Heretics are to blame. Pay them back."
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_b_02","Heretic sabotage, most likely. But it's not going to stop you, right?"
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_b_03","You can bet it's the heretics making trouble. Lucky for me, you'll hand out a little payback, right?"
"loc_sergeant_a__power_circumstance_start_b_04","Heretics. You can bet it's the heretics causing trouble. Probably think you're scared of the dark."
"loc_sergeant_a__static_01","[Static]"
"loc_sergeant_a__trapped_response_01","Reading high activity in your area!"
"loc_sergeant_a__trapped_response_02","That whole damn sector just came alive!"
"loc_sergeant_a__trapped_response_03","Movement everywhere! Show them what you've got!"
"loc_sergeant_a__trapped_response_04","Looks like you've made friends. Lots of friends!"
"loc_sergeant_a__trapped_response_05","See them off. These scum are no match for you lot!"
"loc_sergeant_a__twins_epilogue_03_a_01","Take it from an old soldier - whatever's going on between Zola and Rannick, you keep your head down and your mouth shut. We're paid to kill, not to think."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_01","We've had a bit of a problem with the ventilation system in your area, so don't expect to see much."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_02","Ventilation system's gone a bit haywire. It's not toxic - we don't think - but visibility's gonna be poor."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_03","As you can probably see by now, the ventilation system's not working right."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_a_04","Ventilation system's having a bad day, but ain't we all? This'll be a low visibility engagement."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_01","More heretic sabotage, I reckon. It never ends."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_02","It'll be those damned heretics playing games again, you mark my words."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_03","Heretic sabotage has been on the rise lately. They never seem to get bored."
"loc_sergeant_a__vent_circumstance_start_b_04","Heretics have been meddling with the subsystems. Wouldn't be the first time."
"loc_sergeant_a__vox_introduction_sergeant_01","Morrow online."
"loc_sergeant_a__vox_introduction_sergeant_02","This is Morrow."
"loc_sergeant_a__vox_introduction_sergeant_03","Listen up, Morrow here."
"loc_sergeant_a__vox_introduction_sergeant_04","Morrow speaking."
"loc_sergeant_a__vox_introduction_sergeant_05","Morrow here."
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_h_01","Enough of that heretic filth…"
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_i_01","Right, listen up! We got a well trained traitor army on our hands, and this Wolfer fellow seems to be at the head of it."
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_j_01","The inquisitor’s Wyrmwood agents have tracked their latest propaganda broadcast, giving us the location of their staging area."
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_k_01","Two of Wolfer’s Lieutenants, the Karnak twins, are leading operations in HABZONE HL 70-04."
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_l_01","The Carnival was never a nice area, but now the Heretics are dug in like rats."
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_m_01","Word is that some kind of stimm is spreading through the streets, making those nasty buggers even nastier."
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_n_01","See if you can turn the tide and get us a win on the board, eh?"
"loc_sergeant_a__wolfer_speech_o_01","Right, you’ve got your orders. Get out there and bring those heretics to their knees!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_01_a_02","You've got this, comms or not. Just keep fighting."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_01_a_03","You've trained for this. Don't let the dregs grind you down."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_01_a_04","You don't need orders for this, do you? Just kill everything you see."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_01_c_01","We'll see about that."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_01_c_02","Yak, yak, yak. That's all heretics like you ever have."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_01_c_03","Your turn's coming, Wolfer."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_01_c_04","Ignore that heretic. Ain't worth your notice."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_a_01","They know you're coming, but they won't stop you."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_a_02","This mission's blown, stealth-wise. Ain't gonna matter in the end."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_a_03","We've lost the element of surprise, but that don't matter."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_a_04","Our plans are blown, but the Emperor's with us."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_c_01","Getting real tired of your voice, Wolfer."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_c_02","Always the same old bollocks with your sort."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_c_03","Say it all you like. It don't make it true."
"loc_sergeant_b__mid_event_conversation_02_c_04","This team don't know how to lose. You'll see."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_a_01","Okay, that's the amphitheatre. The cyphers you grabbed earlier will get you in."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_a_02","Amphitheatre's in sight. It'll be locked down, but that's why we grabbed the cyphers."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_a_03","That's the amphitheatre. Time to put those cyphers to good use."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_a_04","You're at the amphitheatre. I'm updating your crypt-key with the cyphers."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_b_01","If the stimms are there, get the roof open and signal the extraction team. If not ... well, we'll figure that out."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_b_02","Find the stimms, get the roof opened up for valkyrie access and we'll send in the extraction team."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_b_03","Find those stimms and get ready for extraction. The roof'll have to go, for a start."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_b_04","Once you've found the stimms, open up the roof so we can get an extraction team in for you and the payload."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_c_01","Just remember, that roof's going to make a hel of a racket, so I hope you've got your fighting trousers on."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_c_02","You're bound to draw attention when the roof opens, so be ready."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_c_03","The roof's gonna be a giveaway as to what you're up to, so expect friends."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_amphitheatre_c_04","The heretics'll be on you like stink on an Ogryn once that roof opens up."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_02_a_01","That's it. You're getting closer all the time."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_02_a_02","Getting closer. Just hold it together a little longer."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_02_a_03","You're making good progress. Don't come apart on me now."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_02_a_04","Almost to the amphitheatre. I'm almost impressed."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_01","Pick up the pace. You don't want to get trapped here."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_02","Keep it moving. This place is a death trap."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_03","You get cornered here, that's it. You're done."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_04","Don't get pinned down. Push forward."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_01","That's the brewery. Quickest way to the amphitheatre is right through there."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_02","There's the brewery. Cut through to the amphitheatre, and make it quick."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_03","The amphitheatre's on the other side of the brewery, so you'd best get in there."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_brewery_sighted_a_04","Not far now. Head through the brewery, and don't get sloppy."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_a_01","You're heading down into HL-70-04, known as the Carnival in the local lingo. If you can't buy something there, it ain't for sale."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_a_02","Right. You're heading into the Carnival, HL-70-04. It's a seedy old place, so I reckon you'll feel at home."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_a_03","You're approaching HL-70-04, the Carnival District ... though that ain't the official designation."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_a_04","This is the Carnival District. Not exactly the finest side Tertium has to show, but we go where duty takes us."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_b_01","It ain't a reputable area, but it's worse now the Moebians have taken over. "
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_b_02","Never been much of a looker, all considered, but the Moebians have made it worse."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_b_03","It's something of a Moebian stronghold now, which ain't ideal as you can imagine."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_b_04","Moebians have the place on lockdown. Anyone still alive down there is either a heretic, or damned by association."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_c_01","The Moebians are running stimms out of the amphitheatre. Might just be a sideline. Might be related to the Blight. Only way to know for sure is to grab some for analysis. "
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_c_02","You'll be heading for the amphitheatre - ground zero for the local stimm trade. If the Moebians are involved, you can bet there's a connection to the Blight. So we want some for analysis."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_c_03","The local amphitheatre's a crossroads for all the district's illegal trade - including the Moebians' illicit stimms. They could be connected to the Blight, so we want a sample for study."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_briefing_c_04","Make for the amphitheatre, and find a sample of the stimms the Moebians are pushing. Might not be anything to do with the Blight, but with our luck I wouldn't bet against it."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_a_01","That's the terminal you're after. Get those damn cyphers!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_a_02","That's the terminal. Get your data-interrogator in place!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_a_03","Terminal located. Let's hope it has the cypher codes."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_a_04","Looks like you've got a terminal. Get your data-interrogator set!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_complete_a_01","You've got the cyphers. Get out of there before you're overwhelmed!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_complete_a_02","That's the cyphers! Get moving!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_complete_a_03","Those are the cyphers we needed. Time you were out of there."

"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_ending_b_03","Extraction's coming. You got the stimms and got out alive. Better than projected."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_ending_b_04","I'm hearing that your extraction's inbound. A good night's work. Come home."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_01","Make your own door. Come on, move it!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_02","Time to ring the door chime."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_03","You'll have to make your own entrance."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_breach_a_04","No time to go around. Make a hole."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_01","First stop's the refectory. The Moebians are using it as a barracks, so you should be able to pick up today's cypher codes that'll get you into their stockpile."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_02","Make for the refectory. It's a heretic barracks right now, which means you should be able to pick up the amphitheatre cypher codes."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_03","First objective's to breach the refectory and ""borrow"" today's cypher codes for the amphitheatre."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_first_objective_a_04","There's a nearby refectory that the heretics are using as a barracks. Find a way in and grab today's cypher access codes. If you ain't too busy, that is."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_01","Weren't exactly the most salubrious place, even before the Moebians took over."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_02","Just the place to fetch a knife in the back, ain't it?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_03","Heresy spreads quick down here. Keep your heads on straight."

"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_01","Try to keep the noise to a minimum, would you? ... Oh, look who I'm talking to ..."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_02","Keep the racket down. No need to go drawing attention."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_03","You make too much noise and this is gonna get a lot less cosy for you."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_04","I wish you lot'd make less noise. Serves me right for not leaving this to an Auric strike team."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_refectory_a_01","Right, that got their attention. Find those damn cypher codes!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_refectory_a_02","You're gonna get friends. Grab those codes before it gets proper nasty."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_refectory_a_03","So much for subtlety. Get in there and find those codes."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_refectory_a_04","You know how to make an entrance, I'll give you that. Find those cyphers!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rivals_a_01","That Wolfer's turning out to be a real pain. Gonna have to do something about him"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rivals_a_02","Remember the time we thought Wolfer was out of the picture? Happy days."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rivals_a_03","Wolfer's mean and smart. Not a good combination for us."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rivals_a_04","I don't reckon you're making yourselves popular with Wolfer. Good job."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_01","Right. Signal the extraction team ... And you might want to see if you can do something about those reinforcements."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_02","Let the extraction team know you're there ... and it couldn't hurt to deal with the reinforcements."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_03","Signal the extraction team ... but if those reinforcements keep coming, you'll be lucky to get out of there."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_roof_opened_a_04","Signal for extraction, then see what you can do about those reinforcements, yeah?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_01","If possible, we want to do this without bringing the whole district down on us. To that end, let's see if this thingamajig of Hadron's is working."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_02","Let's do this quiet - or as quiet as you lot can manage. No need to wake the district. Hadron's managed to breach the vox array, so maybe we--"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_03","I know stealth ain't exactly your thing, but give it a try for me, would you? We'll scrape what we can from the heretic vox array, but no guarantees."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_04","Get in, get out and do it quiet. May not look it, but you're in a heretic stronghold right now. Speaking of, let's see if this vox hacker works ..."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_01","Happy days. Looks like Masozi got you in nice and sneaky."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_02","Sweeter than music, that. Means you've got a free hand. Don't waste it."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_03","What a shame. The heretics don't know you're here."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_rooftops_e_04","And that's how you do a stealth insertion."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_01","Another obstacle? No time to be subtle."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_02","Way's blocked. You know what comes next."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_03","Can't have that lot getting in the way, can we?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_second_breach_a_04","Gonna need more explosives to clear that out."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_01","Bless this gadget of Hadron's. Head towards the brewery. You can lose 'em in the side streets. It's a warren."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_02","Bless you, Hadron. I love a bit of confusion. Make for the brewery, and see if you can lose 'em in the side streets."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_03","Sounds like you're free and clear ... for the most part. Head for the brewery."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_c_04","These heretics can't talk to each other? What a shame. Better head for the brewery before they get things fixed."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_a_01","That's what we came for. You know what to do."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_a_02","Those are the stimms. Nice to know this wasn't wasted."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_a_03","Stimms ID'd. On to the next phase."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_a_04","Stimms confirmed. Time to hustle."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_d_01","Sounds like you're wearing out your welcome. Pick it up, would you?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_d_02","Someone doesn't sound happy."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_d_03","You're in it now. Better make me proud."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_armoury_stims_d_04","Time to shine. Or get killed. One of the two."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_01","There's something nasty in HL-16-11. You're gonna do something about it. "
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_02","The Blight keeps spreading out of HL-16-11. We need to slow it down."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_03","Things ain't good in HL-16-11, so guess where you're heading?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_01","You'll proceed to Hab Dreyko and gather data on the current Blight strain. We'll use that to tailor a shriving unguent that can kill off that festering ""tree"" in Hab Laranax."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_02","The Phage Tree in Hab Laranax is a key Blight source, so you're gonna gather some data for Magos Kharib can create a necessary shriving unguent. With me so far?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_03","You'll be taking out the Phage Tree in Hab Laranax. To do that, Magos Kharib needs data on the latest Blight iteration to tailor a shriving unguent."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_01","My advice? Wear gloves and breathe as little as possible. You come back infected and you won't be coming back at all."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_02","Make no mistake: this is gonna be a mucky job. If you've got any complaints? I don't want to hear them. Got it?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_03","Should be straightforward enough ... if you keep your nerve and don't go touching things you shouldn't. Guess we'll see, won't we?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_c_01","[Laugh] Good lass, Masozi. Give 'em hel."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_c_02","Death from above? Can't argue with that."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_c_03","Teamwork. Gotta love it."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_01","Right, this is the place. Get your servo-skull out and get me that data on the Blight. "
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_02","Here we go. Deploy your servo-skull. She'll point you towards the scan targets."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_03","Should be plenty of data hereabouts. Let your servo-skull sniff it out, you grab it."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_a_01","That should do it. Transferring the data to Magos Kharib for analysis. Make your way to Hab Block Laranax."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_a_02","Looks good to me. Magos Kharib will pick over this while you make your way to Hab Laranax."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_a_03","Right. I'll get this data to Magos Kharib for analysis. You get yourselves to Hab Laranax."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_a_01","Analysis is progressing nicely. Make sure you do the same."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_a_02","You should see this data. The Blight's getting nastier."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_a_03","Our Magos Biologis needs more time, but he's confident we'll get something."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_market_c_01","I don't know why Zola wants to bother killing Wolfer. He'll give himself an aneurysm at this rate."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_market_c_02","Old Wolfer's having a bad day. Breaks my heart. "
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_market_c_03","Doesn't sound like Wolfer's enjoying himself much. Ain't that a shame?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_neglect_a_01","Watch your step. This place looks like it could collapse at any minute."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_neglect_a_02","Stay alert. They'll be coming for you."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_neglect_a_03","Could be an ambush around every corner. Stick together."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_poison_a_01","That thing's ugly as ever. Magos Kharib's come through. Set your biotic probes running and deploy the shriving unguent."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_poison_a_02","There's the Phage Tree. Magos Kharib has come through with this ""blessed unguent of shriving"" or whatever. Set your biotic probes."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_poison_a_03","Set your biotic probes and let's get this filth purged ... assuming this unguent of shriving is all that Kharib says it is."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_a_01","Revolting. Probably won't put it out of commission for long, but it'll buy us time. Get out before you're overrun!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_a_02","Can't be certain that's the end of the Phage Tree, but it'll take a while to grow back at least. Show them a clean pair of heels."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_a_03","Disgusting stuff, but it warms my heart all the same. The Phage Tree's bound to regrow, but it'll take time. Time to make your escape."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_c_01","We could have done without that, but you'll pull through."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_c_02","I guess you're getting more heretics to humiliate."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_c_03","Sounds like you'll be getting more friends."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_01","You're at the quarantine zone. Expect heavy resistance."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_02","Watch your step in the quarantine zone. They know you're coming."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_03","Quarantine zone sighted. Advance and clear. Watch your backs."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_b_01","You've picked up a following."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_b_02","They really don't sound happy."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_b_03","Bless 'em. They really thought they'd stop you."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_c_01","Glad this widget of Hadron's is still working. Sounds like you're expected."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_c_02","I'm starting to see why Rannick loves listening in so much."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_c_03","Gets addictive, this eavesdropping. I used to be an honest soldier."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_a_01","You know the drill with this one. Splice into the auto-scheduler, redirect a train and give an arch-heretic a good old Atoman double-tap."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_a_02","This ain't nothing particularly new. There's an arch-heretic travelling by train. You're gonna intercept 'em, and paint the platform walls with their brains."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_a_03","You know how this one goes by now: cross the bridge, splice the auto-scheduler and give an arch-heretic the last surprise of their foetid little life."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_a_04","This is an old favourite of mine: redirect a heretic into Chasm Station, blow 'em to bits and then walk away with a nice big smile on your face."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_b_01","However, Zola says I should warn you that we've been having a lot of vox bleed. Comms might get a little bit patchy."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_b_02","Word of warning: comms might get a bit patchy. We've had a few teams moaning about that. Like I care."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_b_03","Comms ain't exactly perfect at the moment. Could be sabotage, could be good old incompetence, so I won't always be in contact."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_b_04","We're having a bit of trouble with the vox network, so comms might be patchy. Nothing to worry about."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_c_01","But I'm sure you can handle a bit of vox interference. Go on, make me proud."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_c_02","But I'm sure you'll handle it. If you don't, I'll just send someone else."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_c_03","Get it done, get back and don't worry about it in the meantime, yeah?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_briefing_c_04","My advice? Don't overthink things, and just have some fun with it."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_cross_station_a_01","You're on the wrong side. You need to get across."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_cross_station_a_02","Get to the other side of the station! Move it!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_cross_station_a_03","You need to cut across the main hall. Do it!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_cross_station_a_04","Get across the main hall before you're overrun!"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_01_a_01","Yeah? My money's on them, you heretic filth."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_01_a_02","Big words. Shame none of your lot can back them up with actions, ain't it?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_01_a_03","The Emperor's with you, team. So why don't you go push the kill target's face in?"
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_01_a_04","The Emperor's with us. And you've got nothing."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_02_a_01","This is it. You've come this far, now get it done."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_02_a_02","I know you won't let me down."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_02_a_03","You know what comes next: get in there, get 'em dead, and get out."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_02_a_04","One last effort. Make the Emperor proud and give me a reason to smile."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_first_objective_a_01","Right ... you need to head to the-- [Annoyed Noise] [Static] Hadron? What's the--? [Static]"

"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_second_objective_a_01","Keep going. I need to have an argument with our tech-priest."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_second_objective_a_02","Head on to the station. I'll try to fix these comms."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_second_objective_a_03","Nice work. [Frustrated Growl] I hate this vox."
"loc_sergeant_b__mission_station_second_objective_a_04","Glad something's going to plan. Head for the station."

"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_03_01","Who am I?"
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_05_01","The hive world of Atoma Prime is a vital stronghold of Imperial power."
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_06_01","No matter the darkness, no matter the wracking storms of space, Atoma Prime must stand resolute."
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_07_01","But a threat has come, the very darkness I am sworn to deny."
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_08_01","Who am I?"
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_10_01","I have learned that Atoma is cursed by the dark stain of Chaos. Chaos is the Archenemy of Mankind."
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_20_01","...and cut out every scrap of darkness I find."
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_21_01","Who am I?"
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_23_01","The Emperor protects."
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_24_01","WHO AM I?!"
"loc_servitor_male_a__cs06_servitor_speech_26_01","WHO AM I?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_01","You do what you like on Rannick's time, but you behave aboard my ship."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_02","You scuff so much as an inch of deck, and it'll go badly for you. Understand?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_03","Look what Rannick's lackeys have done to my Mourningstar!"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_04","This used to be the pride of the fleet, would you believe? Now look at it!"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_05","Don't let Rannick intimidate you. Nor Grendyl. The Mourningstar's mine."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_06","You get a whiff of a good trading opportunity, be a love and let me know."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_07","Can't speak for Rannick's people, but you can trust mine."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_08","If you're short of gear, have a word with Commander Hallowette. Call her ""The Perfect One"" if you want to get on her good side."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_09","One of Rannick's scribblers has set up his stall somewhere around here. I hear he's offering special assignments in exchange for Inquisitorial Marks."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_10","If you fancy a stroll through the Deep Hive, see Brunt. He's a bit rough around the edges, but he knows his stuff."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_11","Grendyl isn't paying enough for this ..."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_12","Don't go wandering out of bounds. My armsmen will shoot on sight."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_13","It's lacking comforts down here, but you don't need much, do you?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_14","The Mourningstar, overrun with convicts and criminals. My mother would turn in her grave ... if she'd had one."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_15","You're a rough lot, but war's a rough business."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_16","Might as well eat, drink and be merry. Unmarked graves for us all, the way things are going."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_17","Always interesting to see what kind of rogues Grendyl's press-ganging."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_18","Prove yourself, and I might have a berth for you. Trust me, it pays better than Grendyl's ""honest"" work."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_19","Just watch yourself around Rannick. You're an asset to him, not a person."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_idle_20","It's a real hive of activity down here. Little of it honest, and that's how I like it."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_01","Move along."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_02","Don't waste my time."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_03","Which one are you? No matter."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_04","All of Rannick's little minions look the same to me."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_05","I'm sorry ... Was there something you wanted?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_06","Keep moving."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_07","I think you've mistaken me for someone else."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_08","I hope this is important."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_09","Well ... What is it?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_10","I hope you're not going to waste my time."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_11","I don't need to speak to the likes of you."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_12","Speak your piece, but mind your tongue."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_13","What is it now?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_14","Were you given leave to speak with me?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_15","Whatever it is, I'm sure if can wait."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_16","Be quick, or say nothing at all."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_17","What could you possibly say that I'd want to hear?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_18","I'm going to assume you approached me by mistake."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_19","Can you think of a reason I shouldn't have you dragged away?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_20","Impertinence, is it? Alas that these days should be mine."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_01","Still alive, are you?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_02","You want a place among my crew, just let me know."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_03","Is the war going well? I can never tell."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_04","You've got a new scar, I see."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_05","Grendyl hasn't gotten you killed yet? Good."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_06","Still here, are you? [Sigh] Yes, so am I."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_07","Grendyl keeps everyone in the dark. Doesn't matter if they're old friends or new recruits."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_08","I heard your last deployment was ... exciting."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_09","I'd fly the Mourningstar far from Atoma ... Only Grendyl would find me."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_10","Things can't keep on as they are ... Mark my words ..."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_11","If only I could get back to honest trading ..."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_12","I should be on the frontier, not playing glorified courier ..."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_13","Takes a special sort to survive this long. You're doing well."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_14","Hallowette says she's impressed with you. Don't expect her to admit it, though."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_15","The Imperium isn't perfect ... but it's all we have."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_16","Yes, the Imperium's heartless, uncaring and ruthless, but what else is there?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_17","I cannot condone the choices Grendyl makes, but nor can I see another path."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_18","There is still a future for humanity, but you and I must earn it."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_19","We are all cogs in an uncaring machine. Though perhaps it's better not to know it."
"loc_shipmistress_a__hub_interact_likes_character_20","Take my advice: the Emperor saves those who save themselves. Keep your eyes open and your guard up."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_all_players_required_a_01","I will not clear your crypt-key until you are grouped up."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_all_players_required_a_02","Gather, Rejects, so that I can trigger the door release."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_all_players_required_a_03","Gather together at the airlock release, if you would."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_all_players_required_a_04","You must gather together. Do not make me ask again."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_extraction_a_01","You are now cleared to extract."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_extraction_a_02","Lieutenant Masozi? Recover our Rejects, if you would."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_extraction_a_03","An acceptable performance. You give me hope for the future. Time to come home."
"loc_shipmistress_a__info_extraction_a_04","Mission complete. Those of you still capable of walking will find extraction at the pre-arranged location."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_black_market_a_01","Another prize for Lady Alice. She does love the dissolute."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_black_market_a_02","What a den. I can see Lady Alice rubbing her hands with glee."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_black_market_a_03","Not the most pleasant of areas, but I have seen - and survived - worse."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_a_01","I would recommend against lingering. It's a bad place to be trapped."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_a_02","There will be no help for you if you are trapped here. Keep moving."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_brewery_cellar_01_a_03","You shouldn't dally. This place is a death trap."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_01","Lady Alice would appreciate this place. She'd see its potential."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_02","A brew-hall fit for Lady Alice. Doubtless she'll stake her claim."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_brewery_main_brewery_a_03","I fancy that Lady Alice will be interested in this place."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_01","The next few moments should be very interesting."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_02","And now we will see if these rejects are as good as Grendyl claims."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_03","This seems an artless way of achieving the objective."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_cipher_terminal_b_04","Needless confrontation. [Sigh] Grendyl's methods never change."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_01","Look at all this. Atoma hardly seems worth saving, does it?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_02","We spill a lot of blood to reclaim such worthless streets."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_insalubrious_a_03","Hardly a district worthy of our labours."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_01","Were I you, I would keep as low a profile as you can manage."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_02","It would perhaps be better if you did not draw further attention."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_low_profile_a_03","The way you carry on, one would almost think you had a death wish."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_01","I thought this was supposed to be a stealth mission."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_02","Oh, very good. No one will have heard that."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_03","Not exactly a low-key entrance, was it?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_refectory_b_04","At least the attention lets you know you're alive."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rivals_a_01","It is reassuring that Grendyl still has some grasp of how to run an operation."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rivals_a_02","Your talents are not without use, tech-priest. I hope Grendyl appreciates them."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rivals_a_03","Grendyl hasn't lost his eye for finding fools ready to die for him."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_01","Interesting to see that you've taken charge of this mission, tech-priest."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_02","Ah ... the tech-priest emerges from her shrine."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_03","Interesting that Morrow saw fit to let you direct this mission."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_a_04","Lately you seem to be handling field operations more and more, tech-priest."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_01","Yes, and from my observations Grendyl's warband could use all the efficiency it can get."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_02","A welcome attitude, and exceedingly rare."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_03","And we can always use more of that. Some, more than others."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_rooftops_c_04","Efficiency has never been Grendyl's forte."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_01","I doubt the Moebians are ready to give up the chase."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_02","You appear to have kicked a stingwing hive."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_03","One despairs for the lost art of silent infiltration."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_01_b_04","The heretics seem quite exercised. This might prove challenging."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_01","You are employing my ship and my crew. My attendance seems diligent."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_02","We are allies, are we not? Allies do not have secrets."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_side_streets_02_b_03","Is that concern? Surely you have nothing to hide?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_stims_b_01","Auspex readings show enemies converging on your location."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_stims_b_02","Enemy activity has been reported. I thought you'd like to know."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_stims_b_03","The enemy will not leave you alone for long."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_stims_d_01","I have issued launch clearance for your support team."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_stims_d_02","Launch clearance issued. There are benefits to being in command."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_stims_d_03","Launch clearance has been granted. The rest is up to you."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_b_01","If they survive ..."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_b_02","Assuming they don't die."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_armoury_survival_mid_b_03","That's supposing your team isn't overrun."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_01","I have assigned you to an assassination mission in the region known as the Torrent."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_02","Your valkyrie is inbound to the Torrent. Your duty this day? To eliminate an arch-heretic."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_03","You are inbound to the Torrent to perform a long overdue assassination."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_04","This mission is a simple one: descend to the Torrent and assassinate an arch-heretic."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_01","Your quarry has made a fortress of the local enforcer station. Breach, clear and eliminate."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_02","The local enforcer station is now a heretic stronghold. Your target awaits within."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_03","The target has transformed the local enforcer station into a vile stronghold ... of sorts."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_b_04","You will find his stronghold - once an enforcer station - something of a challenge."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_01","Keep in mind that the district is likely alerted to your coming. Take no chances."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_02","What innocents once dwelt in this area have long since fled. Treat all-comers as hostile."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_03","I will be monitoring your performance, and unlike Grendyl ... I have standards."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_04","Do the Emperor proud, Rejects. In the end, that's all any of us can hope for."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_b_01","There is little profit in sorrow, Kayex."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_b_02","Regrets and sorrow are of little service, Enginseer."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_block_entrance_b_03","A tale told in many quarters, its power lessened in each retelling."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_01","The Phage Tree in Hab Block Laranax is an increasing concern. I can't have operatives bringing its Blight aboard ship."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_02","The Phage Tree in Hab Block Laranax must be suppressed ... or preferably destroyed. That brings me to you."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_a_03","I am told that a Phage Tree in Hab Block Laranax is the source of the Blight. Well, we can't have that."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_01","You will gather data from the area, allowing us to create a blessed unguent of shriving capable of destroying the tree."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_02","Gather data from Hab Block Dreyko that we can use to create a blessed unguent of shriving to poison the tree's ... unique nature."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_b_03","We require Blight data from Hab Block Dreyko, in order to synthesise a shriving unguent capable of poisoning the tree."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_01","Do try not to make a muddle of things."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_02","I will be monitoring you closely. I recommend that you do not disappoint."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_briefing_c_03","Shall we? After all, you've come an awfully long way for this."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_a_01","Do you suppose that is the end of the Phage Tree, Kayex?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_a_02","Will the Phage Tree recover, do you imagine?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_a_03","Is it possible that the Phage Tree will blossom anew?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_c_01","I feared as much. Still, there is a reason that vigilance is eternal."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_c_02","I knew it. Good fortune has escaped me ever since I met Grendyl."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_escape_conversation_c_03","That would be in line with my current fortunes, I suppose."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_01","This appears a suitable location to gather data."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_02","I think we will find all we need here."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_a_03","A suitable harvest site, Kayex?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_b_01","I bow to your judgement in these matters, Kayex. Operatives? The Phage Tree awaits."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_b_02","Whatever you think proper, Kayex. Operatives? Proceed to the next hab."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_first_scan_complete_b_03","If you are certain, Enginseer. Strike team? You may proceed to Hab Laranax."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_b_01","Control yourself, Kayex. There is nothing we can do for them at this hour."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_b_02","Please set an example to the strike team, Kayex."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_market_approach_b_03","These outbursts are scarcely proper. Contain them."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_market_b_01","I've told you before: don't call us pre-servitors. It's ... presumptuous."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_market_b_02","I've warned you before about using that ... unhappy term. We are not pre-servitors."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_market_b_03","Kindly do not refer to us as pre-servitors."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_a_01","This is all quite splendidly vile. Wouldn't you agree, Kayex?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_a_02","Disgusting. Though I really don't know why I expected better. Do you agree?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_a_03","I suppose I should be grateful that stench does not carry over vox and auspex."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_c_01","I will take that as a ""yes""."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_c_02","You might simply say ""yes""."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_neglect_c_03","As ever, your poetry is execrable."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_a_01","That must be the Phage Tree. It's even more repulsive than I imagined."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_a_02","Isn't that Phage Tree magnificent? ... In a repulsive sort of sense."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_a_03","Is that the Phage Tree? It's glorious ... and utterly revolting."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_b_01","I think that is your cue to depart, team."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_b_02","I suggest you leave that place, team ... while you still can."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_poison_complete_b_03","A definite success. Team? I suggest you leave."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_b_01","You take joy in the strangest things."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_b_02","Dignity, Kayex. Forever dignity."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_post_airlock_b_03","Calm yourself. You're making me feel tired."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_01","You are approaching the quarantine zone. I expect at least moderate success from you."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_02","I understand that this is the edge of the quarantine zone. Curious."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_quarantine_a_03","If my ... information is correct, you are now approaching the quarantine zone."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_a_01","I shall expect full quarantine protocols to be in effect for the strike team's return."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_a_02","Before I forget: full quarantine protocols to take effect immediately."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_a_03","I trust you are ready to instigate a full quarantine for these operatives?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_c_01","They will survive, I'm sure."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_c_02","What is life without a little pain?"
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_roof_airlock_c_03","How thoughtful."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_b_01","It's very simple, Kayex. I'm curious about the Blight ... and I don't trust Rannick to indulge my curiosity."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_b_02","I find myself yearning for a more active role. And I grow weary of Rannick's secrecy."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_b_03","Knowledge is always valuable, Kayex. A fine quarry."
"loc_shipmistress_a__mission_habs_redux_start_zone_d_01","I'm sure Rannick will see it elsewise, but that is very much his problem."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_02","A 0.5% drop in Leman Russ production would be sufficient to make this warzone irrecoverable."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_two_03","Leman Russ losses stand at 73.45% in current engagement projections. Reinforcements are alpha priority."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_03","Too hot. Too cold. Too hurt. Too tired. All you do is complain."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_cooling_heat_response_04","I would extend my sympathies, had I any."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_abandoned_a_01","This place is a temple. It should be restored. Revered."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_b_02","It functions for the moment. That will suffice."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_b_03","Further expeditions can build on our success. The Omnissiah wills it."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_a_01","Unforeseen circumstances have granted us an opportunity to access a lost foundryplex."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_a_02","We are presented with an opportunity: access to a lost foundryplex in the inter-zone void."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_a_03","Omnissiah be praised! Tertiary assets have located a foundryplex in the inter-zone void."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_b_01","Such facilities were once responsible for forging ""true"" Moebian Steel, rather than the pale imitation we know today."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_b_02","With access to such facilities, we can produce the Moebian Steel of old, rather than the substandard modern formulation."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_b_03","Such a find would allow us to at last produce the Moebian Steel recorded in the annals of Saint Messelina, rather than the modern dross."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_c_01","Let us uncover its secrets together ... but do not let down your guard. Our contact's motives are ... unverified."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_c_02","You will make contact with our informant and reactivate the foundryplex - a task well within your limited capabilities."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_briefing_c_03","Initiate contact with our informant, follow his instructions and wake the foundryplex. Understood?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_dead_machine_02_a_01","I sense the machine-spirit. It is restless. It yearns to awaken."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_dead_machine_02_a_02","Proceed, varlets. I shall consider the appropriate ritual of awakening."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_dead_machine_02_a_03","A great work stands dormant beneath your feet. You should consider yourselves honoured."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_01_a_01","Let us hope the malfunction is easily rectified."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_01_b_01","I believe you mean the synchronistors."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_02_b_01","True. Should this happen, Varlets, you must perform a manual reset or be forced to start again."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_03_b_01","So my readings confirm. What harm have you visited on this marvel?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_blown_a_01","Varlets, you really must be more attentive. Start again."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_blown_a_02","You were too slow. Begin the sequence again."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_blown_a_03","You must not let the synchronistors overload. Do it again, and strive for adequacy."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_a_01","Here, Varlets! Begin the Ritual of Awakening."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_a_02","This is the appointed hour. Let the Ritual of Awakening begin!"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_a_03","Let the machine-spirit awaken. Coax it forth."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_complete_a_01","Function is restored. You may proceed to the foundryplex's sacrarium."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_complete_a_02","Function ... returning to acceptable levels. Proceed to the Sacrarium Mechanicus."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_smash_a_03","Ice build up? An unavoidable hazard, but readily rectified."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_widget_not_working_a_01","The diagnostic hymnal shows an error somewhere above you. Investigate."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_widget_not_working_a_02","Error localised. The failure point is located somewhere above you. Attend. Redress."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_02_widget_not_working_a_03","According to the diagnostic hymnal, the fault originates somewhere above you."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_briefing_a_01","I assume you were able to disable the skyfire auto-defences once the machine awoke?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_briefing_a_02","The skyfire auto-defences ... please confirm that you annulled them?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_briefing_a_03","Did you disable the skyfire auto-defences?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_end_a_01","The Ritual is complete. Behold the glory of Moebian Steel. I shall see it is put to good use."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_end_a_02","So ends the ritual. What once was mundane has now received the Omnissiah's Blessing. It shall be put to good use."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_end_a_03","Behold! Moebian Steel. Rejoice, Varlets, for you have done holy work this day. The war for Atoma is forever changed."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_start_b_01","Excellent. We may now begin the process of turning base alloy into famed Moebian Steel."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_start_b_02","Good. Let us now harness the mysteries of the Omnissiah. Let us call forth Moebian Steel."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_event_03_start_b_03","Then we may proceed with the production of Moebian Steel."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_objective_01_b_01","I'm sure the varlets will handle the repairs."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_objective_01_b_02","Such tasks lie within these operatives' abilities. Well, for three of them."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_objective_01_b_03","I selected these operatives for their aptitude in such matters."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_objective_02_a_01","At last. The shores of the foundryplex. Proceed, varlets. Let us wake the holy machine."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_objective_02_a_02","You have arrived. Proceed, and tread with reverence. This relic is beyond your comprehension."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_objective_02_a_03","Remember that you tread holy ground. Serve the Omnissiah proudly until you meet grisly unfunction."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_01_a_01","I would appreciate knowing how you discovered the location of this foundryplex."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_01_c_01","My endeavours are not a suitable topic for conversation."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_02_a_01","I still find it improbable that an ... individual like you could uncover the foundryplex's location."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_02_c_01","Very convincing, I'm sure."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_03_a_01","I find it concerning that the Moebian Traitors have found this holy place."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_03_c_01","Someone like you, perhaps?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_b_01","Contact protocols require caution when dealing with individuals such as yourself, ""Swagger""."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_b_02","You presume too much on our relationship, ""Swagger"". This operation will proceed as I dictate."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_b_03","Operative Codename: Swagger is disagreeable. I may yet call upon you to terminate him Varlets."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_d_01","Yes, yes, yes. I'm sure ... May we now proceed?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_d_02","[Sigh] This already grows interminable. Shall we commence?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_d_03","Kindly refrain from unnecessary use of the vox channel and proceed."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_01_a_01","I understand you claim to be an old acquaintance of Inquisitor Grendyl's."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_01_c_01","I see."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_02_a_01","If you wish there to be trust between us, you should consider being more forthcoming."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_02_c_01","You should also work on sounding more convincing."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_03_b_01","And yet you feel the need to say so. Curious."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_void_vista_a_01","Blessed Omnissiah ... may we one day reclaim this majestic work."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_void_vista_a_02","I will never tire of this sight. Strive to be worthy of it, Varlets."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_core_void_vista_a_03","What became of the foundryplex's electro-priests? Its artisans and rune priests?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_01","Activate Ascender d/16, varlets!"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_02","Well, what are you waiting for? Activate the Ascender d/16."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_03","Activate Ascender d/16. Proceed to upper levels."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_activate_stair_04","You have reached the Ascender d/16 only a fraction later than you should. Well done."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_01","Sanction Redactus target authorised. Location? [Sigh] Locals call it the Torrent."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_02","You are to complete a Sanction Redactus mission, varlets. A target requires execution."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_a_03","Your next assignment is a Sanction Redactus in Habzone HL-18-66. The Torrent, to some."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_03","Approach is to be made through the underhabs. Try to preserve the element of surprise."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_briefing_c_04","Expect heavy resistance. For the slower among you, that means 'many enemies'. Shoot first."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_waypoint_01","Proceed through Sanctum Iudexis TM8-707 to Magistrati Oubliette TM8-707."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_03","This maintenance area is in substandard repair. Much is, around here."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_maintenance_area_04","A maintenance area? Oh, I could tinker for hours in there."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_enforcer_reach_cells_01","Access Penitentiary Elevator 3. Proceed to Kill Target location."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_02","Alternate egress required. I suggest you display your characteristic subtlety."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_detonate_a_03","A detonation charge is required. I trust you remembered to bring one?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_ambush_ended_b_01","You expected too much of them, enginseer. It's all they can do to hold the data-interrogator the correct way up."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_01","An establishment within an establishment. I don't know where they get their duplicity."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_02","A childish attempt at concealment ... but then, what should we expect?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_elevator_a_03","A concealed room? [Sigh] But then so much of what the heretics do is ... theatrical."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_b_01","You are certain?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_b_02","Is that so?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_den_entrance_b_03","A definitive statement. Is there no room for error?"

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_habs_a_03","I see the heretics have made free with the local population. It is quite the workforce."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_01","Must you dawdle, varlets? Enginseer Kayex-8 is becoming unsettled."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_02","You are dragging your feet again. I trust one of our feedback sessions will not be required?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_01_a_03","Alacrity, varlets! Strive for it in all things. You may start now."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_01","Perhaps you should sever yourself from the fusion grid. Spare yourself this discomfort."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_02","I question the wisdom in subjecting yourself to this any longer, enginseer."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_habs_hurry_02_b_03","You need not endure this torment any longer, enginseer. The objective is within our reach."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_01","An acceptable performance. I think we may consider this matter concluded. Expedite your return to the surface and await extraction."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_02","I have no further instructions, varlets. You are free to head to extraction. I trust that meets with your approval?"
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_end_a_03","Mission parameters have now been met. Extraction may now follow. Were I you, I would not linger."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_01","A lamentable waste, but it was not in our power to save them."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_02","It seemed the most efficient course."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_destroy_mid_b_03","Not all that is lost can be saved, enginseer. Stillness is preferable to subversion."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_01","Intel recovery: acceptable. You may proceed with the demolition phase: destroy the synthesizers."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_02","You have successfully harvested the available data. Now destroy the operational synthesizers."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_end_a_03","Data reclamation: satisfactory. Destruction: warranted. Render the marked synthesizers non-functional."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_01","I cannot fault the heretics' ingenuity, though I abhor both their goals and their methods."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_02","I confess that this lair has a certain ... rough ingenuity."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_production_lab_scan_mid_a_03","[Sigh] I tire of seeing Tertium's systems subverted to heretic goals."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_01","Enginseer Kayex-8. You have made a deep system-study of this part of the hive. We require that knowledge."

"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_b_03","I greet you, Enginseer. I anticipate that your study of Tertium's systems will improve our efficiency."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_01","We seek a concealed establishment - one that draws considerable power from the fusion grid."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_02","Objective: concealed heretic establishment. Conjecture: this establishment draws excessive power from the district fusion grid."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_safe_zone_d_03","We must locate a concealed establishment. It is my theory that this can be done by interrogating the district fusion-grid."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_streets_b_01","Be assured you do not need to understand his words, Varlets. You need only follow the waypoints he assigns."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_streets_b_02","Close your ears to his words, varlets, lest the splendour of the Omnissiah's wisdom burn out your feeble brains."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_raid_streets_b_03","You might spare us your theatrics, enginseer ... which are in any case lost on everyone save myself."
"loc_tech_priest_a__mission_rails_briefing_a_01","Special issue ammunition reserves are critically low. This is unacceptable."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_02","What am I to do with you, specimen?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_03","You are a peculiar specimen."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_04","You have the look of one soon to be dead."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_05","I promise I won't hurt you ... much."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_06","Speak, Dross."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_07","You are pitiful."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_08","You are a challenge for us both."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_09","What a wretched creature you are."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_10","Don't be afraid ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_11","If I kill you, no one will ever know ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_12","What now?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_13","Ugh ... Say what you must."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_14","Another feeble-minded blunt for Sefoni to mould."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_15","Yes? What?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_16","Oh, go away. Can't you see that I'm busy?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_17","Oh good. Another worthless blunt."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_18","Your mind is so small. However do you get anything done in there?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_19","I will take care to speak slowly, so that you might understand every other word."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_dislikes_character_20","Oh dear ... I can see this is going to be one of those days ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_01","Let us explore your limits together."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_02","Your skills could be sharper."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_03","Have you come to learn?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_04","Let me unveil your true potential."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_05","You are clay, waiting for the sculptor."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_06","What training do you seek?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_07","I will make an operative of you yet."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_08","I will mold you. I promise."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_09","Another plaything for Sefoni?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_10","Oh ... hello ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_11","I will mold your mind. Your body will follow."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_12","Choose your lessons wisely."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_13","You've come to learn? Splendid."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_14","Let me guide you towards perfection."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_15","I will be your light in this shadowy world."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_16","I've worked with worse."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_17","You're fascinating. I hope I don't break you."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_18","Let Sefoni prepare you for inevitable martyrdom."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_19","You are a curious one. Let Sefoni see what you're made of."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_interact_likes_character_20","Let's see what I can make of you."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_backstory_a_01","Tell me of your past ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_backstory_a_02","What brought you to this place?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_backstory_a_03","Think of the past. What would you like to remember?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_body_type_a_01","Reveal your true self."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_body_type_a_02","Another detail, for Sefoni ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_body_type_a_03","Show me who you are ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_conclusion_a_01","All done. A new life is yours to lead."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_conclusion_a_02","You are born anew ... or as near as makes no difference."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_conclusion_a_03","Sefoni is finished. You are just beginning."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_frequent_customer_a_01","Tell me ... are you indecisive, or simply uncertain?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_frequent_customer_a_02","Again? Well, it's your mind."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_frequent_customer_a_03","Perhaps make wiser choices this time."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_personality_a_01","What is your nature?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_personality_a_02","Your personality, tell me of it."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_personality_a_03","Who do you wish to be?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_select_option_a_01","Ahhhh ... Interested in changing your past, are we?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_select_option_a_02","Let Sefoni weave a new fiction of what was ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_mindwipe_select_option_a_03","Sefoni will remake you ... No one will ever know ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_01","Always more beneath the surface there is. Dark thoughts and treachery."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_03","The web of lies stretches deep below Atoma's skin."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_04","What if the Moebians are the symptom, not the disease?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_05","I hear chanting in my dreams. Calling for ... something horrible."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_06","Can't you feel it? The whole world shudders with hate."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_07","Allegiance is a complicated thing ... given in one breath and stolen in the next."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_08","Black veins beneath the streets. Black whispers in the darkness."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_09","Rot always goes deeper than anyone thinks ... did you know that?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_cult_01_a_10","What is thought new is often just newly seen. Ideology shapes perception."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_01","So many soldiers coming and going. So many playthings for Sefoni."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_02","The Immaterium roils with approaching vessels. This war grows."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_03","Do you feel it? More soldiers are coming ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_04","The dead cry out for vengeance ... They will have it, you will see."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_05","We are all locked together, trapped in a war that will never end [Laugh]."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_06","Each soul is a candle in the darkness. Many are soon to be snuffed."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_07","Sefoni will have more playthings, said Grendyl. Yes. Yes yes yes."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_08","Loyalist? Traitor? No. Only death will rule Atoma. A throne atop a pile of corpses. I've seen it."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_09","They come in their thousands, their millions. The war quickens."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_escalation_01_a_10","They swarm about Atoma, so many bright lights ... A feast of fools for hungry gods."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_01","Zola is so often in two minds. I wonder which guides her today?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_02","Zola is troubled. The future terrifies her."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_03","You should watch Zola. Or you shouldn't. I'm not your keeper [Laugh]."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_04","Brunt is nowhere to be seen. I wonder why?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_05","Melk is a tricksy one. Don't be fooled by his bluster."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_06","Melk is searching for something, did you know that? Grendyl doesn't. I think."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_07","Do you sense Morrow's weariness? His burdens are heavy."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_08","Morrow will endure, they say. But what if he does not?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_09","The Shipmistress grows ever more unhappy. Friendship can bear only so much."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_hub_crew_01_a_10","The Brahms family has never much cared for servitude. Lady Emora is no different."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_01","You should hear Tertium's nobles squabbling. All of them looking for advantage."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_02","It is a rare war that does not bring opportunity."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_03","Lord Margrave ... I feel his ambition from here ... A bold man."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_04","Margrave, Barquette, Consora, Van Sparzi ... Children squabbling in the dust."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_05","Even now, the wheels of politics grind the defenceless to dust."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_06","Is there anything more tedious than the chatter of politicians?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_07","I hate Tertium's politicians. So many lies ... They make my head hurt."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_08","Conspiracy abounds in the upper spires ... To what end, I wonder?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_09","Lord Margrave should watch his back ... The king's throne is always tempting, even in the face of oblivion."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_politics_01_a_10","Atoma is clay beneath many squabbling hands."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_01","A warzone is an opportunity for shiftless, aimless folk ... Just like you."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_02","I keep touching the thoughts of a Magos Biologis roaming the hive. I wonder if Hadron knows him?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_03","Bounty hunters are looking for work in the hive. It's definitely a buyer's market."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_04","I hear that Rax Corran has set up shop in the Deep Hive. Nasty piece of work, that one."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_05","It can only be a matter of time before another inquisitor comes snooping. No trust among them, no. Is very sad."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_06","Don't tell anyone, but Melk has a secret team scouring the city. I wonder what they seek?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_07","I hear whispers in my mind. Xenos whispers. The sword and the crescent beneath a shifting cloak."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_08","There are many strange minds on the surface. We have guests."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_09","Who are these hands of Messelina I feel stalking the streets? I do hope they're not going to cause trouble."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__hub_rumour_wanderers_01_a_10","I sense a shrouded mind in the hive. A void I cannot touch. You are to keep it away from Sefoni, do you hear me?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__incoming_suppression_desc_a_01","Enemy ranged attacks cause Suppression, making it harder to land accurate shots. Get out of the line of fire to restore accuracy."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_01","The device's machine spirit purrs ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_02","The device is in place ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_03","Your device is working ... for now ..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_decoding_in_progress_a_04","I think it's working. How fun."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_01","The mechanism is almost done."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_02","The process is almost complete. How nice."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_03","This process is almost done. Yes, yes, yes."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__info_hacking_mission_almost_done_a_04","It is nearly done. Prepare yourselves."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__lock_in_melee_desc_1_01","Closing with Ranged enemies forces them to stop shooting and engage in Melee combat."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_01","You sound strange, Oska. Where are you transmitting from?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_02","Your vox signal is unhappy, Doctor. Where are you?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_airlock_ponderings_a_03","Sefoni hears much interference on your vox, doctor. Where are you hiding now?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_01","From time to time I ... assist Doctor Krall with an undertaking."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_02","The handsome doctor and I often ... collaborate on his art."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_a_03","Handsome Oska and I are ... artists. We sometimes collaborate on a particular ... challenge."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_01","This process requires highly specific components if the subject isn't to die screaming."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_02","If this is attempted without the correct components, disaster is yours ... mine ... everyone's."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_b_03","Everything must be precisely as it should ... including the correct tinctures and ointments."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_01","You are to steal the necessary components from the heretics and bring them to Doctor Krall. Or else Sefoni will do something ... regrettable."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_02","So you are to steal what I require from the heretics and deliver it to handsome Oska. After all, the heretics won't miss it when they're dead, will they?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_briefing_c_03","Steal these components from the heretics. Rip them from their cold, dead, pustulent fingers. Then bring them to Doctor Krall."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_01_a_01","Would it not have been easier to seek Morrow's blessing for this enterprise than hide from him, Oska?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_01_c_01","That I can believe."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_02_a_01","Let Sefoni know if Morrow returns. She can change his mind for him."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_02_c_01","Silly. Sefoni has done it all before."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_elevator_conversation_03_b_01","You should have seen him in the old days, before Sefoni ... It doesn't matter."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_01","Now all you need do is leave ... and make delivery to Oska."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_02","I think you can leave. I'm sure Oska is waiting for his delivery."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_complete_a_03","Kindly be leaving this place. Doctor Krall will be waiting."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_01","Sefoni was right. Sefoni is always right."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_02","You are to blame for this, Oska."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_a_03","This is all your fault, Doctor."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_b_01","Agreed. Shall we proceed, playthings?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_b_02","Sefoni concurs."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_one_dead_b_03","No more delays, playthings. On you go."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_b_01","You are a very flawed genius, Doctor."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_b_02","It would be safest for us all if you were to stop talking, handsome Oska."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_corruptor_two_dead_b_03","Please be quiet, Oska. For Sefoni."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_b_01","Sefoni would prefer that you didn't tempt fate."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_b_02","Why would you say that? You know what will happen."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_end_event_riser_moving_b_03","[Sigh] And that is when he doomed us all."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_b_01","Ah, so you are back?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_b_02","Back with us, handsome Oska?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_complete_b_03","Ah ... Doctor Krall returns."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_01","Handsome Oska? ... No, he is not there. "
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_02","Doctor? ... Still hiding, I suppose."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_a_03","Doctor Krall? ... Still a pillar of courage."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_b_01","So it falls to Sefoni to issue instruction? Override the lockout capacitors with power cores, then use data interrogators to move the trains."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_b_02","My playthings, heed Sefoni. Use power cores to trip the lockout and your data interrogators to move the trains."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_start_b_03","Playthings, use power cores to neutralise the lockout capacitors. Data interrogators can override the trains themselves."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_01","So very professional. Now move the trains."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_02","The capacitors are lifeless. How nice. Now for the trains."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_event_one_step_one_complete_a_03","The capacitors are overcome. How will you fare with the trains?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_b_01","Sefoni is sure that we will soon know for certain."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_b_02","Do not coddle them, handsome Oska. They know their business."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_first_tracks_b_03","Such a shame. I do like sparkles. "
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_b_01","Sefoni could blank the fear from your mind, if you like?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_b_02","Sefoni can suppress such fears. Or change them into something pleasant."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_pipe_bridge_b_03","Perhaps you should let Sefoni smooth the fear away?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_siding_a_01","You are nearly at the maintenance siding. Then the fun begins."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_siding_a_02","Sefoni believes that you are nearly at the maintenance siding."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_siding_a_03","Keep going. The maintenance siding is not far. Trust Sefoni."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_start_a_01","Yes ... This looks like an acceptable beginning."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_start_a_02","Ah ... So you all survived the landing? Good."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_start_a_03","Four enter the fray, but how many will leave? ... Sefoni knows."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_start_c_01","Do not rush them, Oska. Mistakes might happen."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_start_c_02","You cannot hurry perfection. Trust my playthings. They will not disappoint."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__mission_rise_start_c_03","So impatient, handsome Oska. It is not becoming."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__npc_first_interaction_a_01","You must be the new recruit Explicator Zola spoke of. If I am honest - and I am seldom otherwise..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__npc_first_interaction_b_01","I am not impressed. No wonder she recommended you for further training."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__npc_first_interaction_c_01","Once you are shackled to my glorious Psykhanium, I will mentor you in the skills an operative needs to survive."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__npc_first_interaction_d_01","One assumes, you do want to survive? Have no fear. My psychic conjurations cannot kill you..."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__npc_first_interaction_e_01","...though they may leave persistent feelings of inadequacy."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__player_first_intro_cinematic_a_01","Welcome to the Meatgrinder. Everything here may feel real, but don't worry ... you won't get hurt, not unless you anger poor Sefoni."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__player_first_intro_cinematic_b_01","Don't be alarmed by my little puppets. But do shoot them... Or hit them. A lot. With whatever weapon takes your fancy. "
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__player_first_intro_cinematic_c_01","They won't feel it. They're not real. They exist only so that you can learn more about me and about the weapons you carry."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__player_first_intro_cinematic_d_01","Stay as long as you like. Sefoni likes the company ... and the taste of your bloodlust."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__psyker_ability_desc_1_01","Psykers always have access to Psychic abilities in combat. Psychic abilities build Peril. Too much Peril is lethal. Meditate to quell your Peril."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__push_follow_up_desc_a_01","You can perform a unique follow-up attack after a push."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__pushing_desc_a_01","Pushing can stagger groups of enemies. Pushing requires stamina."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__ranged_grenade_desc_1_01","Grenades can be equipped and thrown. Each class has access to different Grenades."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__ranged_suppression_desc_a_01","When ranged enemies are shot at, they flinch, becoming Suppressed. Suppressed enemies try to take cover and will not fire back."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__reviving_tutorial_desc_a_01","Downed teammates can be helped up. Incapacitated teammates are captured by the enemy, but can be rescued."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__sprint_slide_desc_a_01","Sprinting helps avoid ranged fire. Crouching while sprinting performs a Slide. Sliding helps evade attacks similar to Dodging."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tagging_desc_a_01","Dangerous enemies can be Tagged to alert your team. World Markers can be placed to help coordinate your team's tactics."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_advanced_training_end_01","You've completed my advanced training. I'm ... I don't how I feel."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_advanced_training_end_02","Advanced training is now complete. I wonder how long you'll last in the field?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_advanced_training_end_03","I have given you the gift of advanced training. Please do not squander it."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_armour_01","Use your heavy attacks against armoured enemies. BAM! [Laugh]"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_armour_02","If your enemy is armoured, hit them harder with a nice, heavy strike. Don't flail!"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_armour_03","Armoured Heretics are dispatched quicker if you use heavy attacks."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_attack_chains_01","Always chain attacks together for maximum damage."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_attack_chains_02","Some chained attacks deal more damage than others. Efficient killing is good, yes?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_attack_chains_03","Chaining attacks helps you maximise damage. You'll want to do that, I think?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_corruption_01","Corruption weakens you ... drains you ... Eventually, it kills you."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_corruption_02","There is much corruption in Tertium. Every time you fall, it consumes a little more of you."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_dodge_01","Keep moving once the fighting starts! You'll be a harder target!"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_dodge_02","Don't stand still! If you stand still, the Heretics will drag you down and kill you. That's bad."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_dodge_03","Not getting hit is better than relying on armour. Keep moving! Make it a dance. I like dancing."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_grenades_01","I like grenades. Not only do they disrupt and kill enemies, they make intriguing messes everywhere."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_grenades_02","If you're being overwhelmed, a grenade can even the odds. BOOM! [Laugh]"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_grenades_03","I don't like crowds. You don't like crowds. That's why you should use grenades."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_health_and_ammo_02","Keep your team alive for as long as you can. Keep them healed and maybe they'll do the same for you."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_health_and_ammo_03","Ammunition is useful, so I'm told. Hoard it. You can't have too much."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_health_station_01","Keep your eyes open for Medicae Stations. They might save your life."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_health_station_02","Medicae Stations are everywhere. Alas, not all of them are working properly ..."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_melee_lock_01","Fight the heretics up close and get shot less. That's probably for the best, yes?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_melee_lock_02","Fighting Heretics up close may be smelly, but it shelters you from enemy fire."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_melee_lock_03","If Heretics are fighting you in close combat, they're not shooting your squad. That's nice, isn't it?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_psyker_ability_01","All Psykers have wonderous gifts. We're very good at killing when we want to be."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_psyker_ability_02","A Psyker's mind is a most powerful weapon. It's my favourite weapon. [Laugh]"

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_push_01","When surrounded, Push enemies away to control the flow of combat."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_push_02","Pushing enemies is a very good way to avoid being overwhelmed. Push, push, push."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_push_03","When the Heretics surrounded you, Push them back to create space. You might even live. How nice!"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_push_follow_01","Push enemies and follow up with a quick attack to take advantage."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_push_follow_02","A Pushed enemy is vulnerable to a counter attack. Enjoy it!"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_push_follow_03","Once you've pushed an enemy, attack quickly before they can recover."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_reviving_01","Leave no one behind. It's too much data-work."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_reviving_02","You can revive your team mates. Even the annoying ones."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_reviving_03","Fallen team mates are captured by the Heretics. You should probably free them."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_special_attack_01","Each weapon has its own unique attacks and Special Attacks."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_special_attack_02","Use your weapon's special attacks to full advantage. You'll live longer ..."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_sprint_slide_01","Don't dawdle through open ground. You'll get shot, and I'll tell you ""I told you so""."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_sprint_slide_03","Use the terrain. You might look silly, but you'll stay alive longer. You want that, don't you?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_success_01","Ah, splendid."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_success_03","Borderline competent."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_success_04","Well done ... Is that what I meant?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_suppression_01","Suppressed enemies cannot shoot back, making them much, much, much easier to assault."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_suppression_02","If you're getting shot, shoot back! Suppress the enemy and drive them into cover!"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_suppression_03","The enemy don't know you can't aim. Start shooting and they'll run for cover!"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_tagging_01","Use your eyes and your noisy, flapping mouth to warn your team of priority targets."

"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_training_end_01","Ah! You have completed your basic training."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_training_end_02","We have now covered the basics. And you are very basic."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_training_end_03","Treasure that knowledge. It will serve you well."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_welcome_01","Ah, welcome to the Psykhanium, little one. Let's make a soldier of you."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_welcome_02","You've come to learn, yes? The Psykhanium is just the place."
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__tg_welcome_03","This is the Psykhanium, a place of torture ... I mean training. Shall we start?"
"loc_training_ground_psyker_a__toughness_damage_tutorial_desc_a_01","Enemy attacks initially damage your Toughness. Once your Toughness is broken, they damage your health. Additionally, enemy attacks will Stagger and Stun you if you have no Toughness."

"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_01","Ah, so glad you could join us. I understand that the heretics are causing trouble in the Clandestium Gloriana. Perhaps you could ... perform some pest control?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_02","Good morrow! I hear the God-Emperor is calling those of sound mind and body to fight for the Clandestium Gloriana. Perhaps you think that applies to you?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_03","Another day, another opportunity to bolster our supplies of Moebian Steel. I should jump to it, if I were you. There might be ... compensations."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_04","Don't just stand there. A fantastic opportunity for heroism and martyrdom awaits in the Clandestium Gloriana. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_05","I wouldn't dawdle. Apparently things aren't going so well in the Clandestium Gloriana. Never mind. I'm sure you're just the fellow to put things right."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_06","You shouldn't be afraid to try new things. Take weaponry, for example. I'm sure you'll find that change can indeed be fulfilling."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_07","You really do have an embarrassment of weaponry at your disposal. You should make the most of it."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_08","Ah ... I see that rapscallion Brunt has uncovered some new types of weaponry. Using you all as field testers, I daresay. Still, where's the harm?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_09","If you had a fancy to test some of these new weapons, I daresay you'll find plenty of opportunity in the Clandestium Gloriana."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__hub_seasonal_juno_a_10","Ah look ... So this is the activator for the shipwide vox ... Really Sergeant-Major, there's no need to take that kind of attitude [Static]."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_a_01","Alas, the environmental systems won't keep the ice at bay forever."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_a_02","The chill of the inter-zone void is insidious. The ice will, alas, return."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_a_03","If the entire foundryplex was functional, the heat would keep the ice at bay. As it is ... ?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_cinematic_b_01","Mourningstar? ... Is this working? ... [Annoyed] Curse this antiquated vox! ... I have vital information for Technoarchaeologist Hadron Omega-Seven-Seven."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_cinematic_c_01","I know of a facility hidden in one of Tertium's inter-zone voids. It holds the lost secrets of forging True Moebian Steel."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_cinematic_d_01","How have I discovered this, you ask? ... A gentleman never boasts. But hurry. I fear the dastardly Moebian 6th are getting closer all the time."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_01_b_01","How can it not be with such fine fellows to serve as our hands?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_02_a_01","The old girl doesn't want to wake up, does she?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_02_c_01","Which places you in abundant, if not necessarily discerning company. I shall endeavour to soldier on."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_elevator_conversation_03_b_01","How splendid, though I confess I hoped for a more fungible expression of thanks."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_01_a_01","Let's see now ... Trigger the power transfer, but stand ready to intercede if one of those, um, ""zappy"" things--"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_01_c_01","Do you? Do I? Well, stand ready in case one fails. Or you'll have to start over."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_02_a_01","This is something of a tetchy mechanism - the synchronistors have a tendency to overload."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_02_c_01","Precisely. I do believe you have grasped my concern."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_03_a_01","The synchronistor relay is functional, but one or two are a little temperamental."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_briefing_03_c_01","Calm yourself, dear lady. As long as a failing synchronistor is reset in time, all will be well."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_complete_a_01","Excellent, the power's restored! To the lateral shuttle!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_complete_a_02","Yes ... Yes ... I think the lateral shuttle will function now."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_complete_a_03","That should get the lateral shuttle moving ... as long as nothing else goes wrong."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_fixed_a_01","Ah, now that's better."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_fixed_a_02","Artfully done. You know, you remind me of myself."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_fixed_a_03","A timely intervention. Splendid!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_fixed_a_04","There, you see? There really is nothing to it."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_fixed_a_05","That was exactly how it should be done!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_fixed_a_06","Very good. You've done this before, haven't you?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_b_01","... by which she means ""press the button""."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_b_02","I'd start by hitting that activator."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_02_briefing_b_03","There should be an activator nearby. Start with that."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_briefing_b_01","I ... think so. We'll have our answer soon enough."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_briefing_b_02","As soon as the power was flowing again ... I think."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_briefing_b_03","You know, I don't recall. It's been so exciting ... my mind is a muddle."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_end_b_01","Yes, that worked out rather well, if I do say so myself. Do run along home. I have a few things to see to here."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_end_b_02","Time to extract, I fancy. Don't worry about me. I'll find my own way back in due course."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_end_b_03","I am delighted to have been of assistance, dear lady. Please extract your team. I have one or two things to attend to before I depart."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_start_a_01","It seems that I did disable the skyfire. Splendid."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_start_a_02","Always gratifying to see one's labours rewarded with results."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_start_a_03","So the skyfire IS shut down. I never doubted."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_start_c_01","If I could trouble the team to start things moving, I'll handle the rest from the control oubliette."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_start_c_02","I shall hie me away to the control oubliette at once, dear lady. Team, would you start things moving?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_event_03_start_c_03","If the team will indulge me in getting things moving, I shall repair to the control oubliette post haste."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_01_a_01","Alas, the inner void is large and our time limited. We'll need to restore power to the lateral shuttle in order to access the foundryplex's heart."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_01_a_02","Crossing the inner void will require access to a functioning lateral shuttle. I have the ""lateral shuttle"" part attended to. You must arrange the ""functional""."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_01_a_03","It's no small thing to cross the inner void. For that, we will need to rouse a lateral shuttle to life with a hearty infusion of the Motive Force."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_01_c_01","Indeed? I stand ready to be suitably amazed."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_01_c_02","You think of everything. I am suitably chastened."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_01_c_03","Then I'm sure we shall get on famously. Let's find out."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_02_b_01","I think I'll let you clear the way. I'm more given to philosophy than fisticuffs."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_02_b_02","I'll linger here awhile. I wouldn't want to get in your way."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_objective_02_b_03","Best foot forward. I shall gallantly guard your line of retreat, should it be required."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_01_b_01","I have my ways ... I hear so many interesting stories. Especially about you, dear lady. Why, I--"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_01_d_01","Of course. I stand humbled and chastened."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_02_b_01","Ah, but people like talking to me. I must have one of those faces. One you can confide in."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_02_d_01","I'm so glad you think so."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_03_b_01","You know, I quite agree. Some unscrupulous bounder must have sold them its location."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_platform_conversation_03_d_01","I will not dignify that insinuation with a response."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_a_01","Aha! There you are ... I was beginning to think you weren't coming."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_a_02","At last! ... Even a fellow of such prodigious capacities as myself can grow bored."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_a_03","Hello there! ... One of us is early or the others are late. I wonder which it is?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_c_01","What a wicked world this is, and so bereft of trust. I am heartbroken."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_c_02","I can see we'll get along just famously. Don't you agree?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_c_03","And a hearty greeting to you as well, my dear."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_e_01","With the greatest of pleasure, dear lady."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_e_02","I obey, oh wise and endearingly cranky one."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_e_03","Your servant, ma'am, ever and always."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_01_b_01","Dear lady, what you understand is hardly my concern."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_02_b_01","That sounds like excellent advice. I shall keep it uppermost in my mind."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_03_a_01","You needn't concern yourself about me, dear lady. I'm entirely harmless."
"loc_travelling_salesman_a__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_03_c_01","Oh, you shouldn't mind that. Alas, I have a nervous disposition and tend to babble."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_a_01","Well, this has been a jolly little excursion, hasn't it? And the best yet to come!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_a_02","Shoulders back! Heads high! This has been a day to be proud of."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_airlock_conversation_01_a_03","Be of good cheer, fellows. Your labours now are almost ended."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_elevator_conversation_04_b_01","Ah ... A fatalist. Then again, there is much to be fatalistic about."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_elevator_conversation_05_a_01","At least the elevator's functioning ..."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_elevator_conversation_05_c_01","Quite right. If anyone fancies offering the Machine God a little prayer, now's the time."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_elevator_conversation_06_b_01","You know the old saying: anything worth doing is better delegated to expendable underlings."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_briefing_01_a_01","Begin the power transfer, but stand by while the synchronistors charge."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_briefing_01_c_01","Because if one overloads the whole sequence will have to be restarted."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_briefing_02_a_01","Once you begin the power transfer, the synchronistors will begin charging. [Doubtful] In theory."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_briefing_02_c_01","Oh, it's nothing really. They may need to reset the odd one or two to avoid catastrophic failure, that's all."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_briefing_03_a_01","These synchronistors are tricky little ingrates. Once the power transfer's underway, keep a close watch for any overloads."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_briefing_03_c_01","No ... At least I can't say for certain. Personally, I cherish my ignorance."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_complete_a_01","Yes ... yes ... The lateral shuttle is crackling to life."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_complete_a_02","That should prove sufficient. I am suitably impressed."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_01_complete_a_03","It's done! No time to tarry: to the lateral shuttle!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_02_briefing_b_01","Indeed. Let us hope it is still functioning."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_02_briefing_b_02","I await the results with bated breath."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_02_briefing_b_03","It is a pleasure to watch you work, Iven."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_briefing_a_01","In case you were wondering, I disabled the auto-defences."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_briefing_a_02","You'll doubtless be delighted to know I soothed the auto-defences."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_briefing_a_03","I did disable the auto-defences, by the way. I'm sure you missed it with all that was going on."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_briefing_b_01","Storm Serpent, begin your approach. Storm Raptor, hold back for now."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_briefing_b_02","Storm Serpent? You heard. Deliver the package."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_briefing_b_03","Storm Serpent? Authorising second stage ... now."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_end_b_01","I am ever your humble servant, my dear Iven. Extract your team. I need to ... attend to some business here."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_end_b_02","There's nothing more to be done here. Let the delightful Masozi wing you home to well-earned acclaim."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_end_b_03","[To Self] Oh ... That is the right reading ... [Louder] Do run along - I need to settle things down here."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_start_a_01","Our task now is twofold: I'll handle the production process from the control oubliette. You handle everything else."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_start_a_02","Strike Team? I'll oversee the production process from the control oubliette. I may call on you for assistance."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_start_a_03","Given the likelihood of violence, I'll be of more use in the control oubliette. I'll require the Strike Team to assist from outside."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_start_c_01","Not at all. Oversight is the far more hazardous burden."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_start_c_02","Hardly. The exposed wiring in the control oubliette is ... potentially lethal."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_event_03_start_c_03","I'll have you know that the control oubliette is a firetrap."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_01_a_01","The foundryplex proper lies across the inner void. We'll need to restore power to the lateral shuttle ... unless any of you can fly?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_01_a_02","We need a functional lateral shuttle in order to cross the inner void. Alas, time's caustic embrace has left the generator moderately unreliable."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_01_a_03","In case you were curious, we're heading for one of the lateral shuttles. The inner void is vast, and it's a terribly long walk otherwise."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_01_c_01","Ah, but there are those ticklish auto-defences to consider. It's better this way."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_01_c_02","Alas for the skyfire auto-defences. Alas also if I forget to disable them before extraction."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_01_c_03","I fear the auto-defences are quite impenetrable until disabled ... but I'll handle that later."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_02_b_01","I shall watch your deeds with great interest. From a distance, you understand."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_02_b_02","I'm certain you shall be a martial revelation. I'll follow when it's ... quieter."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_objective_02_b_03","You'll forgive me if I linger awhile? I wouldn't want to get in the way."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_platform_conversation_06_b_01","Don't be coy. If you want to ask, ask."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_platform_conversation_06_d_01","I'm afraid you're not cleared for that information."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_platform_conversation_07_b_01","It's bracing, so long as we keep moving."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_platform_conversation_07_d_01","Tell me: does the phrase ""frozen solid"" mean anything to you?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_platform_conversation_08_b_01","Never let it be said that heretics aren't resourceful little fellows."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_platform_conversation_08_d_01","You'd be surprised."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_a_01","Aha! Welcome one and all! Words cannot express my fecund joy."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_a_02","There you are! That looked like a rough descent. I've always said that pilots shouldn't fly blindfold."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_a_03","Felicitations and my humblest greetings ... I wasn't sure you'd come."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_c_01","Is that Interrogator Rannick? ... Grendyl always said that you were inclined towards the costive."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_c_02","Interrogator Rannick? A pleasure to finally meet you at last. Grendyl had much to say about you."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_c_03","Can it be? ... Iven Rannick? ... Grendyl's briefing didn't do you justice."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_e_01","Of course, of course. Secrets on every hand ... Shall we begin?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_e_02","Quite right, quite right. Deeds to be done, valour to prove ... shall we?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_e_03","Ahhh ... The good Inquisitor said you'd say that. Never mind, to business!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_01_b_01","Oh, quite secure ... a slight traitor infestation, but nothing your fine fellows cannot handle."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_02_b_01","I'm quite certain that I would not. It's of no concern."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_03_a_01","You really are in for a treat. It's a remarkable place."
"loc_travelling_salesman_b__mission_core_safe_zone_optional_03_c_01","Such a tragedy. Grandeur should always be appreciated."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_dead_machine_01_b_01","Don't be fooled by appearances. The Omnissiah's works are seldom as dead as they seem."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_dead_machine_01_b_02","True, the foundryplex is lifeless for now, but I'm confident we can restore it to vigour."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_dead_machine_01_b_03","This machine isn't dead, but sleeping. You'll see soon enough."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_a_01","That synchronistor's failing! Reset it!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_a_02","It's going to overload. Reset it!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_a_03","It's overloading! Don't just stand there!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_a_04","It looks like we have an overload ..."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_a_05","We have an overload! See to it!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_01_faulty_widget_a_06","Oh dear ... That's not good at all!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_almost_done_a_01","Almost there!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_almost_done_a_02","Just a little more!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_almost_done_a_03","I think you're almost done!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_almost_done_a_04","Keep at it!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_good_start_a_01","An excellent start!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_good_start_a_02","Well done! Keep going!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_good_start_a_03","More to do!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_02_good_start_a_04","Now for the rest!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_agnostic_a_01","Ah ... Now that's not good. See if you can fix it."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_agnostic_a_02","That's ... not what we wanted. Can you fix it from out there?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_agnostic_a_03","There's been a complication. Would you mind terribly ... ?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_batteries_a_01","Ah. A power outage. You'll find some storage cells in the nearby containers."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_batteries_a_02","We need more power. Search the containers for storage cells."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_batteries_a_03","Oh dear, the power's out. There have to be some storage cells nearby."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_cables_a_01","The transmission lines have overloaded. You'll need to reroute the Motive Force."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_cables_a_02","There's a problem with the transmission lines. You'll have to create a bypass."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_cables_a_03","The transmission system is not a happy grox. We need a temporary fix."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_calibrate_a_01","Ah ... the capacitors are in need of calibrating."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_calibrate_a_02","The Motive Force is unstable. You need to calibrate the capacitors."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_event_03_calibrate_a_03","The Motive Force is too much for the capacitors. Kindly recalibrate them."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_hurry_a_01","Do hurry up. Time's a-wasting."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_hurry_a_02","Come along, come along."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_hurry_a_03","Perhaps we could strive for a little more urgency, hmm?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_idle_a_01","Kindly don't stare. It's impolite."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_idle_a_02","What a remarkable specimen you are. Though of what, who can say?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_idle_a_03","I'm sure we've met before. Tell me, were you ever on Vostroya?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_idle_a_04","I see you're envious of what I'm wearing. Many are."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_idle_a_05","Why are you looking at me like that? I haven't stabbed anyone in the back for ... oh, ages."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_platform_idle_a_06","You don't look like much of one for small talk."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_safe_zone_hurry_along_a_01","Do hurry along, team. We've much to do, and many angry fellows hoping to stop us."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_safe_zone_hurry_along_a_02","Onwards, and with haste. If it helps, imagine that the Emperor's watching you with impatience."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_safe_zone_hurry_along_a_03","You are a tardy bunch. Or maybe you're just very relaxed? Either way, you should get moving."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_01_a_01","Still there? Excellent. Do keep up."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_01_a_02","Ah, there you are. I was thinking that I'd lost you."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_01_a_03","A most energising stroll, don't you think?"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_01_a_04","Does one good to stretch one's legs, don't you find? Keep up!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_02_a_01","Keep moving! Not far now!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_02_a_02","Outpaced you again, did I? Well, that's experience for you."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_02_a_03","We really shouldn't keep meeting like this. People will talk."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_03_a_01","One last effort! We'll make heroes of you yet!"
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_03_a_02","Aha ... I thought you wouldn't be THAT far behind."
"loc_travelling_salesman_c__mission_core_swagger_sighted_03_a_03","That's the spirit! Onwards to glory!"
"loc_vocator_a__world_intro_09","Light the engines! Commence Warp translation!"
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_01","Trust is a fool's virtue. Betrayal, his reward."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_02","The Emperor stands at your shoulder in all things."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_03","Obedience is the highest wisdom."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_04","Never falter, for the Emperor's gaze is upon you."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_05","Beloved are the valiant, for they fear nothing."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_06","Fear only the Emperor. Trust only the Emperor. Love only the Emperor."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_07","You are but a mote in the Emperor's sight, but still he sees you."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_08","Selfishness is the credo of the heretic."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_09","Sacrifice is the highest virtue."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_10","Give to the Emperor all that you are. Receive from him all that you deserve."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_11","Seek not forgiveness. Earn it through blood."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_12","You are called to holy labour. Redemption be thy reward."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_13","Embrace this second chance. Prove thy worth."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_14","Questions are the shackles about thy wrists."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_15","Martyrs are the lifeblood of the Imperium."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_16","To perish in the Emperor's service is both duty and reward."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_17","Martyrdom redeems all sins."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_18","Rejoice! For yours is the path of righteousness!"
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_19","You have no secrets from the Inquisition."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_20","Suspicion is a holy virtue. The heretic forever walks among us."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_21","Beware the heretic's poisoned words. Ambition. Equality. Justice. These are the seeds of damnation."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_22","The Emperor owes you nothing, and yet gives all."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_23","Always remember that you are but a wayward child. Obey your elders in all things."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_24","Guard thy tongue, lest it speak heresy unbidden."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_25","Struggle has ever been humanity's lot. Disgrace not those who walked this path before."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_26","By the labours of untold heroes does the Imperium endure."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_27","Indolence is fertile soil for the seed of heresy."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_28","All that you are, you owe to the Emperor."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_29","Obey in all things and earn redemption."
"loc_vocator_b__hub_propaganda_announcement_30","It is better to die a martyr than live a thousand years a coward."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_01","We're a long way from Atoma now, ain't we?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_02","I shouldn't even be here. Tithe fell short of recruiters, so they dragged Throneside to make up the numbers. I got caught in the net."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_03","Enforcers caught me cracking a hab, didn't they? It was join up or end up on the Rad-Shift in the mines. "
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_04","I still remember the parade they threw us. Heroes one and all, we are. Bringing light to the darkness of the Fringe."

"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_captain_a_01","Captain Helmag's all right if you ask me. Not that anyone did."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_captain_a_02","Captain Helmag relies on Wolfer too much. A leader's got to lead by herself, right?"

"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_faith_a_03","We're all martyrs in the making, but our deaths WILL count."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_faith_a_04","The God-Emperor walks with us, if we're worthy."

"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_gortun_a_04","You should have seen Colonel Gortun up at Nihil Gorge. Unstoppable. The man's touched for greatness."

"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_karnak_a_03","No sign of Trooper Hollan. Still, at least it's put an end to his feud with Rinda Karnak."

"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_01","Yeah, Captain Wolfer's a bastard - but he's our bastard."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_02","Wolfer gives you an order, you get it done. Simple as that, if you know what's good for you."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_03","Don't mind Wolfer's scars, recruit. You'll soon have plenty of your own."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_04","I tell you, no one gives a speech like Captain Wolfer. I'd follow that man anywhere."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_a__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_05","Wolfer's tough, but he's fair. Raw recruit or lifer: cross him and you're done."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_01","Just remember: we're fighting for Atoma. Let's make a show of it."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_02","I'd like to see Lord Margrave standing sentry in a flooded trench."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_03","I wish I could see Atoma again before the Emperor calls me ..."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_04","You another Dreyko rat? Me too. Small world ... Well, big regiment."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_atoma_a_05","To Tertium! May her walls never crumble and her light never fade!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_captain_a_01","Command's been giving the captain the runaround about supplies again. She needs to toughen up."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_captain_a_02","Captain Helmag took a round at Nihil Ridge. Doesn't look good."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_commissar_a_01","That bloody commissar. Carrion crow, that's what he is."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_commissar_a_02","Hang on ... How come that commissar get a rebreather and we don't?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_faith_a_01","Got to link up with Command. Emperor, guide my steps."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_faith_a_02","There you are, traitor. Got a holy bullet just for you ..."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_faith_a_03","Saint Messelina, see my deeds. Commend me to the Emperor."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_faith_a_04","Though I walk in the shadow of heresy, I shall stand tall. Thy will shall be done."

"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_firefight_a_01","They're charging! Artillery barrage on my coordinates!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_firefight_a_02","They're dug in! Purgation teams move in: feed them promethium!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_firefight_a_03","Platoon fire on my order. Let's show them how the 6th fights!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_firefight_a_04","The Sixth conquers! It does not retreat!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_firefight_a_05","Throne, the Karnak Twins have punched through! We might just win this!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_gortun_a_01","Now ... don't tell anyone, but old Gortun's got himself a new priest. Gives me the shudders."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_gortun_a_02","I wish I had Gortun's fire. The old man don't know the meaning of fear."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_gortun_a_03","So the colonel's acting strangely? That's highbloods for you, ain't it?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_gortun_a_04","I've said it before and I'll say it again: Gortun would die for any of us. How can we do less?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_gortun_a_05","What a war. Pinned down, bombed out, no reinforcements ... and now Old Gortun's gone missing ..."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_karnak_a_01","Another brawl at Anchorpoint Numen last night. Rodin Karnak beat a recruit half to death."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_karnak_a_02","Rinda Karnak's walking the picket line again. I hope for their sakes they ain't sleeping."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_karnak_a_03","The Karnak Twins? Good fighters, but don't turn your back on them if you know what's good for you."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_karnak_a_04","I don't like the way Rinda Karnak looks at me. Not one bit."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_karnak_a_05","Saw that Rodin Karnak in battle last night. Fights like a karking daemon."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_massacre_a_01","Five thousand of us gone in three hours. This isn't war. It's slaughter."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_massacre_a_02","Survivors? You're kidding, right?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_massacre_a_03","Not gonna lie: today was bad. But we say our prayers and go out again, because that's the job, right?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_massacre_a_04","I never even saw the enemy ... It was just blood and smoke ... and screams."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_massacre_a_05","The enemy are laughing at us, so get back on your feet and show them what the 6th is made of!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nightmare_a_01","You remember how Danner kept complaining of bellyache? He just ... burst ... yesterday. Maggots everywhere. Don't envy the cleanup crew."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nightmare_a_02","The light's never right around here, did you notice? The shadows keep moving."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nightmare_a_03","Had a dream last night. Tertium was burning. The 6th were there but we couldn't stop it. We just burned alongside."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nightmare_a_04","There's ... something ... waiting for me every time I close my eyes."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nightmare_a_05","You look like death, mate? More bad dreams?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nox_alpha_a_01","Sickly skies, weeping trees and that smell ... Nox Alpha's no paradise world, eh?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nox_alpha_a_02","What? We're deploying to Nox Alpha? I'd sooner start a fight with Commissar Magsen."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nox_alpha_a_03","Quit moaning, would you? The Emperor wants us to take Nox Alpha, so that's what we're gonna do."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nox_alpha_a_04","If command want us to secure Nox Alpha, that's what we're gonna do."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_nox_alpha_a_05","Nox Alpha's bad news. The worst. You'll see."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_planetstrike_a_01","No sign of skyfire in the dropzone. Stay alert. We don't know what's waiting for us."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_sickness_a_01","I ain't been right since Nihil Gorge ... but a bit of fever ain't gonna stop me fighting."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_sickness_a_02","Wait! ... Don't go in that bunker. Can't you smell it? Nox Rot."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_sickness_a_03","The contagion's getting worse and no word from command. What do we do, captain?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_sickness_a_04","Had to quarantine half of the Zarka Cage garrison. Whatever this is, it's spreading."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_sickness_a_05","Where's the justice? Hundreds dead to Nox Rot and Rinda Karnak's still standing. Blessed Throne ..."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_traitors_a_01","Some are saying we've got friendlies out there ... I don't karking believe it."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_traitors_a_02","You hear anything about a spectral figure roaming around out there? ... Me neither. Sentries are drunk again."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_traitors_a_03","Sir? This is Sergeant Geeren at Anchorpoint Jorholm. Wolfer's men are killing everyone! We need help!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_traitors_a_04","Hold your fire! They're 6th, like us! Get that karking gate open!"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_traitors_a_05","I can't explain it, sir. The vox lines are scrambled ... but how did the enemy get the freqs?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_01","Where's Wolfer? In the thick of the fighting, where else?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_02","Wolfer's scars? He earned them saving men under his command, so watch your lip, got it?"
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_03","You want to sharpen up your close quarters drill, recruit. Talk to Wolfer. He knows all the tricks."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_04","Commissar Magsen butted heads with Captain Wolfer again today. Won't end well, mark my words."
"loc_warp_echo_moebian_b__martyr_skull_pickup_wolfer_a_05","Wolfer's rages are getting worse. Captain Helmag can't keep covering for him much longer."
