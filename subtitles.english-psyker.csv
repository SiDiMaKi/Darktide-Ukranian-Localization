"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_exile_b_01","Indeed, Sibling ... but then again, they understand almost nothing at all. In fact, I think I saw one of the Zealots nearly choke to death trying to breathe."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_a_psy_a_c_01","I know, but guns are heavy. I prefer to kill mind-to-mind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_lex_two_a_01","I don't understand your obsession with the Lex."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_lex_two_c_01","It doesn’t protect our kind, so why defend it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_lex_two_e_01","I … have never looked at it that way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_acceptable_b_01","Your kind always say that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_acceptable_d_01","True for some, maybe. The rest of us? Well, we're just ""acceptable losses"" aren't we?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aggravate_a_01","The heretics seem especially affronted today. Was it something we said?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aggravate_c_01","Thank you. It's good to know I'm appreciated."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aggravate_e_01","You don't really expect me tell you that without the thumbscrews, do you? Where are your standards?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_blind_a_01","You have a very focused way of regarding the world."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_blind_c_01","I didn't say I approved. You're so lost in the light of the Throne that it blinds you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_b_01","They are doubtless saying the same about us ... the Fanatics, anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_d_01","Let me answer it thus: When did you last consider that you might not be the holiest man in the room?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubt_a_01","You should cultivate doubt. In my experience there is nothing more uncertain than certainty itself."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubt_c_01","Yes, it's the difference between running ""to"" and running ""from""."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubt_e_01","Yes, I could say much the same about you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_endeared_a_01","You don't seem to have endeared yourself to many of the others, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_endeared_c_01","I didn't say I disapproved. It's good that some of us have standards, at least."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enjoy_a_01","I hesitate to say this out loud, but I think I might be enjoying myself."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enjoy_c_01","And now you've ruined it. Thank you so much."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_genius_a_01","One of our ""peers"" was complaining about you, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_genius_c_01","I quite agree. So many tiny minds around us all the time. I don't know how I stay sane."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_glorious_body_b_01","Oh, so you're las-proof now, are you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_glorious_body_d_01","Fine comfort that is ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hobby_b_01","Yes, it was a mercy to kill him. Though perhaps you shouldn't enjoy it so much?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hobby_d_01","It might be that you should find another."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_idiots_a_01","Unfortunately, there is no escaping the conclusion that we are surrounded by idiots."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_idiots_c_01","Yes, incapable of carrying a conversation in a bucket, most of them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_jumble_a_01","I do wonder about Zola. Her thoughts are jumbled up and often contradictory."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_jumble_c_01","I suspect she is more fragile than she seems."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_move_within_b_01","Ugh. No wonder I feel so bloated. "
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_move_within_d_01","Kindly refrain from offering up such disturbing images."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purged_b_01","Yes, yes, yes. I knew that was coming."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purged_d_01","""I'm bored now, burn it all!"" The first resort of the Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purged_f_01","I know what I meant."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tense_a_01","You look very tense, Fanatic. Are you sleeping well?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tense_c_01","I, for one. Sometimes it is better to accept one's helplessness in the face of grinding, unstoppable stupidity."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tense_e_01","You see? Unstoppable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trudge_a_01","Surely there must be another way of achieving our goals with us having to trudge our way through the filth?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trudge_c_01","The odious man. He delights in cruelty!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trudge_e_01","That kind of sentimentality I could do without!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_mouthy_b_01","Oh really? Because some mystical bolt will smite me down. Oh ... Wait ... I'm the one who does that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_mouthy_d_01","If you think so. Just remember about those mystical bolts though ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_advice_a_01","Tell me, has your Beloved any advice for us today?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_advice_c_01","Very enlightening."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_attention_b_01","I would say I'm paying exactly the right amount of attention ... to you, at least."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_attention_d_01","Did anyone else hear something? ... No, must have been a Pox Hound howling in the distance."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_aura_b_01","It's called ""having a free spirit"". Not all of us were broken and used as bloodhounds."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_aura_d_01","Thank you for proving my point. You practically beg to be beaten."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_bearable_b_01","And I confess, Fanatic, that thou art sometimes bearable company."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_bearable_d_01","Yes, only sometimes. Don't get greedy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_candles_a_01","Admit it, you're jealous that I can kill people with my mind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_candles_c_01","Oh, you've no idea. So many little candles, waiting to be snuffed out. One by one ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_candles_e_01","... little lights, fading into the darkness, cold and alone. Shivering, screaming ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_coconut_b_01","I can't say that I have, no. Why do you ask?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_coconut_d_01","And looks like death?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_collected_a_01","You are always so calm and collected."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_collected_c_01","It wasn't a compliment. I sometimes wonder if blood even flows in your veins."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_collected_e_01","Ah ... I make no promises."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_collected_g_01","I make no promises."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_compliment_b_01","And you remain a mistress of the left-handed compliment."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_compliment_d_01","Nor is a lifetime of persecution."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_compliment_f_01","Time will tell."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_creed_a_01","Is there any room for truth in your Imperial Creed, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_creed_c_01","Your truth, you mean."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_cynic_a_01","You seem almost content with your lot. Are you an idiot?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_cynic_c_01","Ah ... You're worse than an idiot. You're a cynic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_dignity_b_01","I'll comport myself how I like. Besides, you might have chosen to be here. I didn't."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_dignity_d_01","I'd be more than content if he stopped moving me around, thank you very much."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_direction_b_01","Just follow me, Brute. "
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_direction_d_01","I don't. I just don't let it worry me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_discipline_b_01","I'll have you know I've been threatened by experts. "
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_discipline_d_01","Yes, they used to say that as well. At least try to be original."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_familiar_b_01","I can't help it ... They have such tiny, fizzing minds. I sometimes can't tell which I'd like to extinguish first."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_familiar_d_01","Hah! I'm only joking. Probably."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_fascination_b_01","Is that admiration I hear? Perhaps a bit of ... fascination?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_fascination_d_01","You are! You're fascinated by me. How ... dangerous of you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_favour_b_01","I'm more concerned about what Morrow might do. Tiny brain, big mouth. Fragile ego. Like so many men."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_favour_d_01","Yes, very reassuring. I feel better already."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_flamboyant_b_01","I can't tell if that's a compliment or a criticism?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_flamboyant_d_01","Then perhaps I shall choose to only be slightly offended ... and slightly pleased."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_friends_b_01","I'm honestly not sure, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_friends_d_01","Then we are friends. Just don't tell anyone."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_full_a_01","I don't know where you get your enthusiasm. Five minutes of this and I'm ready to sit down."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_full_c_01","Yes, you are definitely full of something."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_good_team_b_01","What about me?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_good_team_d_01","It sounds to me like you're doing all the work."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_grey_a_01","Your mind is full of regulations and duty. It's very grey and very depressing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_grey_c_01","That's really what you think? What a horrible way to live."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_grey_e_01","Ugh. There's no saving some people."

"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_implant_c_01","Does that stop it tingling? "
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_implant_e_01","Then why do it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_implant_g_01","I give up!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_intellect_a_01","It is such a relief to have a comparable intellect to converse with."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_intellect_c_01","I take it back. You're no better than the rest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_laxity_b_01","And yet I feel like there's a ""but"" approaching this conversation ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_laxity_d_01","Is this really what friendship is among the faithful? How depressing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_medal_b_01","Really? Can I see it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_medal_d_01","Why not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_mellow_a_01","I keep waiting for you to mellow, fanatic, but somehow it never seems to happen."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_mellow_c_01","Yes, more's the pity ... Is there not one iota of something human beneath all that dogma?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nasty_b_01","If I was, you'd know, wouldn't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nasty_d_01","And maybe I'm just testing you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nasty_f_01","You're only saying that because you're losing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nicer_b_01","That's right, I could, but what would it get me?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nicer_d_01","If it was, we'd only die of rad-poisoning or get eaten alive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nicer_f_01","You're welcome."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_pretext_a_01","Admit it: if heretics didn't exist, you'd find some other pretext for killing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_pretext_c_01","And who decides what constitutes righteousness?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_pretext_e_01","So you make the rules ... or should I say, the ""pretext""?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_relax_a_01","You are always so intense, Fanatic. You should try to relax."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_relax_c_01","Never mind. I can see I'm wasting my breath."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_reliable_b_01","And that was almost a compliment."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_reliable_d_01","Does that mean we're almost friends?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_reliable_f_01","Then maybe I'll be your first."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_salvation_b_01","If I fight hard, there'll be no need for anyone to save me."

"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_scowl_a_01","You're always scowling, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_scowl_c_01","What about?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_screams_b_01","It is ... strangely pleasing. I'm sure I never used to be this psychotic. It must be the company I keep."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_screams_d_01","Yes. I rather thought you were."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_serious_a_01","You're always so serious. Lighten up ... maybe you'll start to enjoy life a little"

"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_service_b_01","Be sure to tell Grendyl. Maybe he'll let me go."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_service_d_01","Yes, I was rather afraid you'd say that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_sneak_b_01","Me? I don't sneak anywhere. Just because I don't stomp around like an Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_sneak_d_01","Yes, yes, yes. A likely story."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_spared_b_01","Spare my life? How many times have you tried to kill me, exactly?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_spared_d_01","Forgive me for thinking my own murder an ""insubstantial detail""."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_spiders_b_01","Why don't you trust me? Afraid I might conjure some flesh-eating spiders to eat you alive?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_spiders_d_01","Hush, my dear. Try not to think about it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_squirrel_a_01","You have a troubled mind, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_squirrel_c_01","What! Where?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_squirrel_e_01","You said you saw a ptera-squirrel."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_stillness_b_01","Perhaps it's because people are always trying to kill me? Did you ever consider that?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_stillness_d_01","You do what works for you, and I'll do what works for me. Yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_team_protocol_b_01","Protocol has been the means of oppression my whole life. I would happily see it all burn."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_team_protocol_d_01","A pretty lie. But it's still a lie."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_tougher_b_01","Oh, how your words wound me. However will I survive?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_tougher_d_01","No, no. I think I've grasped the core of your argument."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_trust_b_01","Trust? It's not often I hear that word."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_trust_d_01","No promises ... but I'll try."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_voices_b_01","You mean your Beloved? "
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_voices_d_01","Erm ... I will certainly try."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_watcher_a_01","You've been watching me. Don't try to deny it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_watcher_c_01","So you see me as a threat?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_wrath_b_01","You couldn't handle more than a fraction of it. My inheritance is that of a people brutalised and abused by your kind. My rage? Hah! You know nothing of it."

"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_01","I don't like it at all. There could be anything waiting out there."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_02","I'm sure there's nothing horrible waiting in the fog. Hah! I wish."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_a_01","Well, I hope you didn't want to see the enemy coming."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_a_02","This is fun! Assuming you didn't want to see our foes until it's too late!"

"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_01","Oh, toughen up won't you? It's me that needs protecting!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_02","Ignore them. I'm the one you should be defending."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_01","Careful Sibling. We wouldn't want to think you had a negative attitude."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_02","I don't like it either, but we're here now. We should watch each other's backs."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_01","For once, I agree. Perhaps we can use one of the others as a distraction?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_02","Indeed. I fear that our luck is growing ever more sour. Given where it started, that's not good at all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_01","I think I'll just hide behind you, if it's all the same?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_02","But I don't want to be close to the heretics! Or any of you, for that matter!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_01","We are all of us misused. Alas that it does not give common cause."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_02","Ah! Is that the rank stench of hypocrisy? I think it might be."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_01","Oh, I'm sure we're all dying as we speak. So long as I outlast you, I am content."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_02","Are you scared, Fanatic? Is some strange human emotion other than rage trying to claw to the surface?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_02_b_01","Succinctly put, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_03_b_01","A limited way of looking at the world, but I suppose the only one you have."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_05_b_01","I'm very glad to hear it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_13_b_01","Everything smells liked death around here."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_17_b_01","Oh yes, you are a monster. But then, so am I."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_19_b_01","Oh, I'm sure you'll work it out."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_03_b_01","How eloquent! Do I recognise the teachings of Helbrandt Tancredi? You're wider read than I thought."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_06_b_01","I'm sure you'll get the chance."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_11_b_01","Their judgement is somewhat sub-par, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_12_b_01","They lied. They always lie. Then they kill you for spurious reasons."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_15_b_01","That's the spirit! Rebel! Throw off your shackles! I will watch your career with interest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_18_b_01","Why, of course you do. It's less confusing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_03_b_01","Be thankful you lack the imagination to guess what's coming."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_06_b_01","How wonderful. The Brute coughs up hairballs now, like a giant gyrinx."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_11_b_01","I suppose you do have more weight to carry."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_12_b_01","Please leave the prometheum tanks alone. I remember last time..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_15_b_01","How liberating it must be to never dream of... more."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_18_b_01","I could root around in your head and bring a little order... But it's beneath me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_01_a_01","Are we not done yet?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_01_b_01","Apparently not. I blame management."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_02_a_01","I was meant for better than this."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_03_a_01","Reduced to a mere ""soldier"". Well, I suppose it could be worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_04_a_01","It makes a pleasant change to be the hunter, rather than to be fleeing witchseekers."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_04_b_01","Doesn't it just? It's really rather cathartic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_05_a_01","Remember: we have value only so long as we remain useful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_06_a_01","Even at its best, the Imperium is a grimy place. Now? Well ... just look at it all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_a_01","In the distance ... a thousand souls ... screaming ... The war does not go well."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_08_a_01","I know none of you trust me. Perhaps you're right."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_08_b_01","Oh, don't talk like that, Sibling. Of course I'm right."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_09_a_01","I see how you all regard me. As if I'm something inhuman. Well, I'm glad to be so."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_09_b_01","I agree. ""Human"" is so limiting."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_10_a_01","Would you believe this is actually more pleasant than much of my recent life?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_a_01","Combat is so ... uncomplicated. I actually find it soothing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_a_01","I think I prefer it when they try to swarm us. At least then I know where they are."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_13_a_01","This isn't over. Then again, when is anything truly over?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_14_a_01","This is a waste of my unparalleled mind. Morrow should have sent a blunt."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_15_a_01","By the Five Rusting Spires ... I'm so very, very bored."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_15_b_01","Aren't we all? Complaining doesn't help anything."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_16_a_01","Ah ... A brief moment of relative quiet. And ... breathe ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_17_a_01","Feeling ... dizzy. I'm not used to all this running around."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_18_a_01","Remain alert, simpletons. I do not wish to die because you keep poor watch!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_19_a_01","Go here, go there, do that. What am I? A performing hound?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_19_b_01","We all dance for the Emperor's enjoyment ... I thought you knew that?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_20_a_01","If you think the heretics' words are bad, you should hear their thoughts!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_01_b_01","Nobody cares, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_04_b_01","Too much longer, in my experience."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_08_b_01","Even your imaginary friend has stopped talking to you? How sad."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_09_b_01","Perhaps you could ask him to speak loud enough for us all to hear?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_15_b_01","If only their screams weren't so distressing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_19_b_01","It's very liberating, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_b_01","Ah, yes. The joy of being a human bioscanner for an uncaring master."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_08_b_01","Spoken like one who has neither known nor desired freedom."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_09_b_01","Oh… You think I fight with you cretins out of trust? How precious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_b_01","Then I am thankful not to be a citizen of Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_19_b_01","[Sigh] I suppose I shall just have to rely on superior intellect and raw power."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_01_b_01","Those who have no choice. There is no shortage of such folk."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_08_b_01","What a splendid martinet you are."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_b_01","It's not exactly to my taste either."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_15_b_01","Forgive me ... but surely if you'd lasted in the Guard, you'd not be here?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_19_b_01","Perhaps if you stood still you wouldn't keep straying into our shots, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_01_b_01","I'm not sure you know what ""glorious"" means."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_08_b_01","Indeed. They are rather ... single-minded."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_b_01","I'm not sure that now is a good time."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_15_b_01","This is as nothing to the horrors of the unfettered Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_19_b_01","I suppose there's something to be said for the direct approach."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_01_b_01","Quite the little ray of sunshine, aren't we?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_08_b_01","Alas, you missed ""profound"" by this much."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_b_01","Glory in victory, malice in defeat? I like the way you think, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_15_b_01","How do you know that? Could it be that you're [Gasp] a filthy psyker too?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_19_b_01","Enough with the Cadian poetry already ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_01_b_01","Shadows hide many things. Closed minds hide more."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_04_b_01","That's an ... intangible commodity at best."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_08_b_01","You're entitled to your opinion, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_09_b_01","""Justice"" is not a virtue in great supply hereabouts, alas."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_15_b_01","Personally I smite them thus because I don't wish to be smitten in return."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_19_b_01","You certainly make up any lack I might have in those areas, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_01_b_01","If it lies to hand, why not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_04_b_01","Yes ... I can well imagine why you'd say that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_08_b_01","Well ... I mean ... That's just basic common sense, surely?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_09_b_01","Indeed. I will settle for a passing grade."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_15_b_01","Yes, yes, yes. But does it have to be the only reward?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_19_b_01","Which by my reckoning suggests that things can only get worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_b_01","Follow me, if you wish, though I fancy you will not like where I lead."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_b_01","No. You merely fear that which you cannot understand."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_07_b_01","If only you could read my thoughts, as I can yours, you'd say the same about me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_08_b_01","If I am to die today, it'll likely be through your superstitious idiocy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_14_b_01","You suppose yourself a guiding light, yet you have neither radiance, nor eyes to see."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_18_b_01","In my experience, prayers to your carrion lord presage only discomfort."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Will this mission never end?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_02","I tire of all this traipsing around."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_03","We are being watched, cretins!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_04","The heretics are merely biding their time!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_05","More heretics approach. I can feel them!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Untidy minds surround us!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_07","Be watchful, cretins! We are not alone."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_08","My incomparable mind tires of this drudgery."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_09","One can grow tired of slaughter."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_one_liner_10","This is not how I saw the day proceeding ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","The ignorant like to give little labels to those who are special. It makes them feel superior."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","Do not worry about it, Brute. These are nought but labels given to the gifted by the unimaginative."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","What does it matter, so long as the foe is slain?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","You worry about the strangest things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","If only there we another, obvious explanation."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","You do know you can take your finger off the trigger?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Cretin! Don't use all the ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","I need ammunition too, you know!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Will you stop stealing all the ammunition?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","Oh. My sincere apologies."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Well, I'm told."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Such a revelation! Also, orks are green."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","You have fearful temper? Imagine my surprise."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_a_01","I confess, I have a bad feeling about this mission."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_a_02","I am struck by a sudden sense of foreboding ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_a_03","I sense trouble ahead ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Yes. This mission has ""disaster"" written all over it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","I concur. Then again, everything's ominous around here ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Yes. What possible harm can come from putting a machine in your brain?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","You'd merely go from being a fleshy lump to being a cyborg lump. A lump, you would remain."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Quick! Someone find something shiny to distract him."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Is there room for boredom in that tiny brain?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Ah. No sense. No feeling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","I fear your pain receptors are overwhelmed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","I do find cheery imbeciles wearying."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","You are happy in your work are you not, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","Personally I would not sully my hands on these pustulent heretics. But then, I don't have to."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","Glad to hear it, Brute. You get your hands dirty so I do not have to."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_a_01","Is anyone else cold? It's always cold."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_a_02","It is always freezing, wherever we go!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_a_03","Why is it always do cold in this wretched place?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","I'm glad I'm not the only one."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","You too, Sibling? So I'm not mad. At least not about that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","There's no need to show off!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Yes, yes, yes. Very impressive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","They are but two heads of the same aquila, and our kind owe them nothing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Blunt instruments both, and no friends of our kind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","I can understand them choosing me for a suicide mission, but you too? That must be galling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","Oh, wonderful. My fate is in the hands of a fatalistic oaf."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Oh, just tell them to go away."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Threaten to devour them. That always works."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","It would not surprise me to learn he is an invention, designed to inspire more of your kind to obedience."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Hero-worship is a dangerous thing. You aspire to servitude, and forget to live."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","Take, take, take, take ... What about a ""thank you""?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","I am not expendable, thank you very much."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","You can run, but you can't escape."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","You should try it. Truly. It'll be educational."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Turning a blind eye is what the authorities do best."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","And why should they care for this world? It is easily replaced."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","I feel you have rather misjudged our relationship."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","If I agree, will you be quiet?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_a_01","I must say, I don't understand your fascination with grenades. Clumsy things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_a_02","Grenades are loud, smelly and crude. Much like some of you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_a_03","Grenades are the perfect tool for a blunt, unrefined and inefficient."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","Agreed, Sibling. But what are we to do?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Alas, sometimes they are necessary."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","If you think things are only just getting bad, you haven't been paying attention."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Ah yes, we must always meet violence with more violence. The way of the Imperium."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","What if none of us are dreaming? Did you consider that?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Maybe we're all dreaming each other?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Liquor is a crutch. Have care you do not lean too hard upon it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","And all this time I believed you were drunk on fervour alone..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","Yours is a special kind of insanity."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","I wondered if you were delusional. Now I know."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","Impossible to say. Rannick keeps us in the dark."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Perhaps. The cost to innocents will be formidable either way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","Well, at least you won't be bored."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","I know. Tragic. What we were talking about?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","Such is the nature of humanity, I fear."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Control the conflict and you control the population. The tyrant's tool never goes out of style."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_a_01","You do know we're all expendable?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_a_02","Our lives mean nothing to Morrow and the others, of course. We're expendable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_a_03","This is most untenable. We are an expendable resource to the others."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","I have grown used to such treatment."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","If it helps, Morrow is no safer than we. The Imperium is built on loyal corpses."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","The Brute feels something? It will think something next."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Oh, tell us all about it, do."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","And if one doesn't care for the smell of burning flesh?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Yes, I can see why you like it. It's the subtlety, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","But at least you're good company. Unlike some I might mention."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Just kill the heretics, Brute. You're good at that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","You're in a strange mood, Sibling. Perhaps some ... medication?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","I know. That's what I've been saying this whole time!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Such a sentimental heart you are ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You are certainly ... memorable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Please be sure to stand downwind of me for the remainder of the day."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Sometimes, Brute, I wonder if you aren't your own worst enemy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_a_01","Poxwalkers. Always Poxwalkers. I hate them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_a_02","Why must there be so many Poxwalkers? Foul things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_a_03","I do not care for these Poxwalkers. Their thoughts are... unsettling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","Yes. Buzz, buzz, buzzing thoughts. Distant screams. Horrible."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","I quite agree. We should kill them quicker."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Oh yes. That scratch looked very painful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Was that a troublesome little bruise, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","Don't waste the medicae! Honestly!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","It hurt. I don't like things that hurt."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","If you wanted it, you should have been quicker."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","I'm afraid we're here for the duration, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","I don't see leave being granted any time soon ... If at all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","I never thought I believed in purgatory, yet here we are."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","Have you ever considered using your inside voice for a change?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Can we not simply enjoy the quiet?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","You really are a simple soul, are you not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","Please! Can you not keep it down?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","You don't speak for all of us, you know."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","You could scarcely do a worse job. Then again, the bar is very low."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Why not? Can things really get worse?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","Toil, ingenuity, artistry... All merely mechanisms of control by Imperial bureaucracy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Sweet sibling, are you really so easily distracted by shiny things while ignoring the horror around you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","Such arrogance to think yourself the only one who's really here. I like it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Aren't you delightfully delusional?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","That sounds very tiring."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","What a complicated creature you are ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","Funny, isn't it, how the likes of Messelina are abominations when living, but blessed saints posthumously."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","I hear Messelina was put to death by the very creed who now venerate her. Funny how that works."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_a_01","You really should all be nicer to me. I have feelings, you know."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_a_02","Would it hurt any of you to offer a kind word from time to time?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_a_03","I wish you'd all stop looking at me as if I might turn psychotic at any point."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","I know! I feel much the same!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","You are not alone, Sibling. Alas, alas, alas."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","Alas, I shed no tears for lifeless stone."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Things before people. A less than admirable attitude."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","Oh no ... Not this again."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","That strikes me as a very, very bad idea."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","I sense a troubled mind..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","You are distressed, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","So glad I was thrown into the fires of battle, only to claim my reward in death."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","I wouldn’t be so sure. I still hear the screams of those who have gone before."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","I was thankful for a moment's peace and quiet, but you ruined it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","You expect me to be thankful? For… this?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","You really need a hobby, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","To what purpose, hmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","I believe it is something do with relative gravities, but doubtless you wouldn't understand."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Inadvertent genetic deviance, Brute. ""Deviance"" is such a splendid word."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","You do know they're probably made from people?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Yes. Cannibalism in a shiny shrink-wrapped packet. Delectable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_a_01","You should think more kindly of me, you know. I might be listening."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_a_02","I can hear someone thinking nasty thoughts about me. Again."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_a_03","You should be more careful with those stray thoughts. I might get offended."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Maybe I just made you think that?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","See how easily you are deceived by an incomparable mind?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","My dear Brute, you're all cretins to me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","There is no shame in being lesser than I. After all, my mind is incomparable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","It makes for an interesting story."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","What an imagination you have!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","Alas, that this fine Imperium finds no value in recuperation."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","I think rather we will be sent into the fray until the enemy kill us, or we expire from exhaustion."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","I'd really rather not."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","I think it's noisy enough already, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","I seldom notice the difference, sleeping or awake."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","That's what you get for gorging yourself."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","From the size of the rifle you know they're ... overcompensating."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Big gun. Small brain. It was ever thus."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","You're so ... exhausting."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Run here, kill that, praise the Emperor ... How tiring."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_a_01","Perhaps we should try being stealthy? If only for the change of pace."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_a_02","I confess I would prefer to sneak around, rather than engage in head-on confrontation."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_a_03","Why must we always charge screaming at the foe? We should employ stealth."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Can you even see who you're addressing? You ask for miracles."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","Lower your expectations, Sibling. Lower them all the way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","Well, don't look at me. I bathe."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","What a thing to say. I am appalled."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Well, that seals Atoma's fate."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","Oh, what can possibly go wrong?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","All I see is a squalid city of despair; a beacon of darkness and human suffering."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","Sibling, what have they done to you? Are you really so blind?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","I am quite comfortable at a distance, thank you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","And what's next? Hugs? Cheery singalongs? I think I shall abstain."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","Yes ... They are oddly pitiable, are they not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","They are screaming children, so desperate for attention they care not whence it comes."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","I suspect we are all equally innocent."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","You are blameless? Me too. What a coincidence."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","Quite the little entrepreneur, aren't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","The gleam in your eyes as you said that... Like a giddy child."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","Such paranoia must be comforting. If you think they're out to get you, you must actually think you matter."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","Present company excepted, I presume? No? How very predictable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","If I were to look into your thoughts, I wonder if I'd find a mind free of sin?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","You sound very confident in your own purity. What would I find if I poked around in your mind, I wonder?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","You speak as if I intended otherwise."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","A palpable hit. How can I survive such wicked words?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","You actually sound as though you believe that. Curious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","Well ... Who am I to argue with such a well-reasoned case?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Oh, another tyrant. Just what the galaxy needed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","Oh, don't you sound important? I'm quaking in my boots."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","Were I to unburden my darkest thoughts, your tiny mind might explode. Literally."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","My only failing is finding myself here, in the company of such pious cretins."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Well ... that's me told ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","I think you might be hallucinating."
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","I suppose you want sympathy?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","Hah! The fearless crusader in the bruised flesh, yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_01","Where are you going?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_02","Yes, I'm sure there's something fascinating over there…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_03","Don't go wandering!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_04","Stay with the group!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_05","For pity's sake, stay with the group!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_06","Fine! Leave! See if I care!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_07","If you're on your own, you're on your own!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_08","You think it's safe to be alone, do you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_09","You should probably come back."
"loc_psyker_female_a__come_back_to_squad_10","Oh no. Please don't leave."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","Surely one of the Inquisitor's influence can do better than this sorry band? Myself excepted, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","Perfect. I should have let the witchseekers take me. It it'd have been quicker."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","I heard some of the ... menials whispering about the 'Cicatrix Maledictum'. This is new to me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","Lovely. So long as it stays away from here, it's not my problem."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","Is there any hope for this place? Not that I care. I'm simply curious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","I really don't understand the attraction of this place. It's a cage. Nothing more."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","Atoma's second hive city ... it isn't lost. I sense its occupants. Why does everyone pretend it is forsaken?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","It will not die! Fight harder!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Simpletons, do you not see it is weaker behind?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","I sense it is weak behind. Maybe try that?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","Nag, nag, nag ... Oh, very well."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Oh, aren't you masterful? ... But it is a good idea."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","The explicator is a ... curious woman."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","What do we think about our gallant explicator?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","Her mind is a series of closed boxes, one inside the other."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She has formidable mental discipline. Not that I've tested it, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","I shall trust her so long as I can see her."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","I haven't survived this long by trusting her sort."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Common rumour claims Zola was whelped on the very world for which we fight."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","I heard a curious thing ... Explicator Zola hails from Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Doesn't sound like information she'd care to have bandied around."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Better she doesn't hear you've been prying, I think."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Oh, fabulous. A flying zealot. Just what we needed..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Because a zealot with wings is exactly what we need..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Are you really so credulous?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","She saw you coming, didn't she?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","The pilot is a wild soul. I don't know if that's good or bad."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","Our pilot is the only one around here who seems truly alive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","Her spirit is unruly. Much like her manner."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","She has an untidy mind. Like a box of wrenches upturned and badly repacked."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Thank you, that's very reassuring I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Oh? Well that's alright then. Blockhead."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_01","Well, that was certainly an interesting sight ... You'll not believe me, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_02","Well, I didn't expect to see that ... though I'm certain you'll not find it credible."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_03","I can scarcely credit what I witnessed earlier. You certainly won't."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_04","Such a sight you missed earlier! Your imaginations surely won't stretch to encompass it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","And yet I sense you're going to keep talking anyway ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Then you can save us all the effort of listening, perhaps?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_01","Our pilot struck the quartermaster cold. It was ... oddly enjoyable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_02","Our pilot downed the quartermaster with a single punch. I confess ... I smiled."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_03","The quartermaster started a fight with our pilot, and regretted it at once."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_04","It was a brawl between our pilot and the quartermaster. Well, not a brawl. More a trouncing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","Glorious! If only I'd seen it!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Brunt had it coming. He's a turgid brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_01","It was poetry. Sheer poetry, I tell you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_02","One punch, and he dropped. Delightful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_03","It took a substantial bribe on my part, but it was more than worth it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_04","It was worth everything I paid her, and more. Hah!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","I sense a troubled spirit ... And it's written all over your face."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","I sense you're troubled ... Why is that?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Gambling is the entertainment of imbeciles ... as you constantly prove."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","A fool is easily swindled, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Its flesh is thicker than you are!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","Bad enough that it's ugly, but now it won't die!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Aim for the head! Isn't it obvious?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Shoot at the head, simpletons! Must I do all your thinking?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Well, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","I mean ... That's basically obvious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_01","Morrow mourns lost comrades. So I'm told ... I'd never spy on anyone's thoughts like that, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_02","Morrow looks at us, but he sees old comrades."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_03","Morrow's past is a burden on him. It should be plain even to you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_04","Morrow is mired in the past, I deem. Old voices and old faces."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","So I've noted. But I can't say that I care."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","Again, an assumption of interest on my part. You should look to that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","Morrow will endure, or he won't. That's his problem."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","Morrow knows nothing of suffering. No blunt ever truly does."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","That sergeant! Good manners cost nothing! Hah!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Yes. Beneath that surly exterior beats the heart of true psychopath."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","Oh? The gruff brute hardened by a lifetime of bullying lacks social graces? Do tell."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","He's a brute, and a blockhead. That's all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Did I say I wished to understand him?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","I think you overestimate my interest. Considerably."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","I'm supposed to care about that, I assume? Give a response to validate your existence?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","I'll have nightmares for days. Thank you very much. You believe Morrow was working for the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","I see. And Morrow was working for the Inquisitor even then?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow carries himself like an old man."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Sergeant-Major Morrow has an older soul than he should."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","If he became lost during a Warp flight, many things are possible."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Many souls become lost on the tides of the Immaterium. Oh yes."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","How do you find Hadron-- I mean, the Tech-Priest?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","I do find the Tech-Priest rather curious, I must admit."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","Truthfully, there is no other aboard this vessel to match my intellect."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","Does her genius intimidate you, perhaps?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","I like her ... Though I'm sure my opinion is of little account."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","I find it's better to keep an open mind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","You actually sound like you enjoy it. Imagine that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","You don't have to sound so eager. You're giving me a headache."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","Yes. The torture. The privation. The oppression. It just screams 'love' does it not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","Oh don't worry. I'm not about to forget all your precious Emperor has 'given' me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Did anyone else hear that strange noise?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","I see you understand the concept of language. The application, however ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_01","I need covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_02","I need covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_04","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_05","I insist you cover me!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_06","Cover me! At once!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_07","I must have covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_08","Covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_09","Can I trouble you for covering fire?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cover_me_10","Covering fire! If it's not too much trouble!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_01","Losing too much blood…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_02","Wounds… too deep…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_03","Oh… That definitely hurts…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_04","Head… ringing…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_05","Must fight on… Show them all…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_06","Keep fighting…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_07","The pain. The terrible pain."
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_08","Oh, my agony…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_09","I hear the dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__critical_health_10","The dead are singing to me!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_a__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_psyker_female_a__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Get off, beast!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Stop biting me!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","Help! Help!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","The Hound has me!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_06","Get this Hound off!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_07","Aaaargh!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_08","Help! Someone help!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","Go away, Hound!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","Begone, beast!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_01","Trapped!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_02","I can't escape!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_03","I can't move!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_04","I'm trapped!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_05","Someone! Get me free!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_06","Free me! At once!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_07","Set me free!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_08","I can't get free!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_09","Help! Help! Get me free!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__disabled_by_enemy_10","Cannot escape!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_01","The Rager's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_02","The Rager's no longer a problem!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_03","That's the Rager attended to!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_04","We've killed the Rager!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_05","That's the end of the Rager!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_06","That's better. So much calmer."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_07","Ah. Tranquility comes a step closer."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_08","Rager's dead. I prefer his mind that way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_09","That's better. No more angry thoughts."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_10","That's quite enough out of you, Rager!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_04_b_01","Yes, yes, yes, I saw it for myself."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_04_d_01","Nobody defends me when I try to help ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_01","The Hound's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_02","The Dog's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_03","The Hound's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_04","The Hound's gone!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_05","We've killed the Hound!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_06","Hound slaughtered."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_07","We slaughtered the Hound!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_08","That's the Hound dead."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_09","Hound's out of its misery."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_10","Hound's no longer a problem."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_01","The Daemonhost's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_02","The Daemonhost's gone!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_03","We killed the Daemonhost!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_04","The Daemonhost is banished!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_05","Daemonhost banished!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_06","Be at peace."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_07","The true soul is freed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_08","This was mercy."

"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","If abhumans are soulless, then psykers must be too. And yet the Imperium requires them for Soul-Binding. Curious..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","And how would you propose tanks manoeuvre on the paths we must take? Let me guess: you haven't thought it through."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","Problem with tanks is the collateral damage. Problem with collateral damage is that it's usually us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","Like attracts like. Amass armoured divisions here, and we'll yet have another Armageddon on our hands."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","Grunts and their toys... Did you learn nothing from Armageddon? I'd rather not be embroiled in a war of that magnitude."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","Oh, to be a tiny, insignificant and largely disposable cog in an enormous, unforgiving machine. What joy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","Look on the bright side, Roughneck. With greater responsibility comes a greater chance of dying a hideous death, alone."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","I believe we're likened to a precise, surgical implement. The Astra Militarum is more of a... great big thunderhammer."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","Much of our work is done in the shadows. Difficult, when you have a thousand cretins shouting battlecries behind you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_01","I sometimes think the common soldier has an easier life than the average psyker. But then I remember that Commissars exist."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_02","Commissars are cold-hearted wretches. Empty minds, too. Nothing but judgement and brutality."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_03","I pity any Militarum soldier who ever crossed paths with a heartless Commissar."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_04","I've met Witch-Hunters with more empathy than the average Militarum Commissar. Wretched creatures!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Mutiny against them is surprisingly rare. I suppose fear is a heady drug."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","They're testament to the limits of the human mind. Broken and rebuilt until their humanity has left them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Orphans all. Indoctrinated by the Drill Abbots of the Schola Progenium, and transformed into brutal taskmasters."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Tragic, really. They are indoctrinated from an early age to believe pain is an illusion, and disobedience is heresy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","Ah yes, it beggars belief how a man might remember which way to point a lasgun without a catechism ringing in his ears."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","What was it now...? Faith in the Emperor guarantees victory, but death in his service is its own reward. I'm sure it's one or the other."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","They peddle both hope and fear in equal measure; explaining to ignorance the nature of the unknowable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","I suppose it's better that they're hunting aliens out there than burning witches down here."

"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Cautious respect is due here, I think."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_one_c_02","A little respect is appropriate in her case, I suggest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_three_a_01","As I understand it, Shipmistress Brahms ensures Grendyl's agents are where he needs them, and when."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_three_a_02","A shame, really, to see so noble a house as the shipmistress' reduced to ferrying Grendyl's operatives."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_three_a_03","The shipmistress often looks like I feel. Probably because she was meant for better than being a ferry captain."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_three_a_04","All these vessels coming and going. Shipmistress Brahms shoulders a great responsibility."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_three_b_01","She was born to high station. That brings burdens and responsibilities."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_three_b_02","I suspect she has spent her life subject to expectation. I know exactly how she feels."

"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_two_b_01","A courageous sentiment, given our situation."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Splendid. This conversation already has the feel of a pre-emptive eulogy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_two_c_01","In any case, surely xenophobia has to go out of style eventually? Yes? Yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Travel broadens the mind. That's why our superiors fear it so. Narrow minds are more tractable."

"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_four_c_01","It is the unblinking eye of prophecy. And from it came legions of Daemons... they wait there still."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Be thankful you aren't blessed with the Sight. The screams of Cadia's dead still echo in my mind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Daemons are extra-dimensional beings that seek ingress to the materium. Pray they don't find it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_one_b_02","What a mercy it must be to lack imagination, blissfully unaware of the enemy at your threshold."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_one_c_01","The opening of the Great Rift has made Daemonic incursions more common than any would like to admit."

"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_three_a_01","Most have no idea what psykers must go through to avoid the predations of the daemon."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_three_a_02","My ""training"" for this mission was more akin to torture. Better than suffering Daemonic interference, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_three_a_03","To think of the inhuman treatment I suffered to strengthen my mind against... the Other..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_daemons_three_a_04","Daemons are drawn to my kind like moths unto flame. Pray to your Carrion Lord that they never get in."

"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","Next time you see a Missionary, ask them about the Imperial Truth. That'll be fun."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","From the mouths of Brutes come truth it seems. But not the Imperial Truth. I believe that doctrine is now deemed heresy..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","The Imperium is shackled to millennia-old beliefs in a godhead who himself fought against the notion. It'd be funny, if it weren't so sad."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","No god could wish this bitter existence on his followers. The truth, I imagine, is long forgotten."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","Personally I would think twice before calling on the Chamber Militant of the Ecclesiarchy..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Hmm. More overzealous Witch Hunters. Just what Atoma needs."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","I've lived this long without seeing the Battle Sisters in action. I'll be happy to go a little longer."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","I hear the Battle Sisters are rather... indiscriminate when it comes to cleansing and purging."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_01","I sometimes wonder just how far the Carrion Lord's word would spread were it not for the Missionarus Galaxia."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_02","The Missionarus Galaxia are an odd bunch. Always spreading light to those who'd much prefer the dark."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_03","There are far-flung worlds who know nothing of the Imperial Creed. At least until the Missionarus Galaxia go poking their noses in."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_04","Sometimes I wish I could escape to a far-off world beyond this creed. Even beyond the reach of the Missionarus Galaxia."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Considering how holy they purport to be, Missionaries are rather keen to oversee atrocities on the fringes of the galaxy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","Many are the isolated worlds who would do well to fear the coming of the Missionary Vessels."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","They also serve as exterminators. Woe betide any xenos who happens to be minding its own business when the Missionaries arrive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","I'm sure Missionaries are a welcome sight... Unless you're a mutant, non-believer or alien."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","Why not, Fanatic? A cardinal is not much different from you. Except for the fabulous riches and frequent baths."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","If you write to the Cardinals, best leave out the part about consorting with psykers. They won't like that bit."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","As far as I'm concerned, the Cardinals-Astra and the Cardinals-Terra are in competition for biggest dogmatists and silliest hats."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Goge Vandire was Ecclesiarch once, wasn't he? And look how that turned out..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","I am a mutant, Brute, though it is uncouth to say so. So is the Mourningstar's Navigator. We are touched by the Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","I believe the definition is: ""Anyone who is not of use to the Imperium."""
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","If your definition relies on the Godolkin Purebreed Index, we're all up for the firing squad."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","The treatment of psykers is a particular travesty. Granted, they can become gateways to Hel, but that's beside the point."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_01","Having seen the methods of the Inquisition first-hand, doing their bidding makes me ... itchy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_02","I accept the importance of our work, but are not the methods of the Inquisition barbaric?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_03","It is hard to reconcile our methods with the notion that we do good in this benighted galaxy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_04","If the Emperor is so beneficent, why does he sanction the cruel and unusual methods of the Ordo Hereticus?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","The killing of heretics was expected. How long before we are called to torture the innocent?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","So much training, and for what? Just so I could turn the excruciators on some blameless wretch?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Those who life a life in fear have more reason to rebel. Perhaps we are not the cure, but the cause."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","It's rather hard not to be guilty of some crime or other in the eyes of the enthusiast."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Oh, joy. The Fanatic is off on another witch-hunt."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Psykers represent Humanity's future. They need help, not hatred."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","Pointing out that the Emperor himself is a psyker would be fruitless exercise, wouldn't it? [Sigh] Thought so."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","The most persecuted race in the Imperium is also the most vital to its survival. The irony."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","It is the consequence of losing half the Imperium behind a veil of nightmares..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","The crusade is a wave of violence fought in a realm of nightmare, instigated by warmongers and madmen."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Always with the grand display of force when subtlety would serve better."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","The lengths some will go to in order to earn a parade ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Be thankful the Cadian Gate did not fall also. He who controls the Gate controls Terra..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","And now the Great Rift looms, and the Imperium split in twain. The light falters..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","There's more to the fall of Cadia than we'll ever know. The Great Rift didn't make itself..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","The Eye of Terror was ever a haunt of evils and long forgotten mistakes. They have a habit of returning."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_01","The Great Awakening has set Mankind on a new path. So many new psykers cry out for guidance!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_02","The opening of the Rift was felt by all my kind, like an act of violence. And its aftermath came the awakening of psykers."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_04","The Great Awakening is both blessing and curse. So much power now courses through us, but at such a cost..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","Dark times are coming. The Black Ships will be packed as never before."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","So many psykers are desperate and confused, like lost children. Yet they are hunted without mercy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","We will have to see what the future holds. I'm sure it will be ... depressing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","Not matter how bad things become, we can rely on the Administratum to make them worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","When the Noctis Aeterna came, I confess I thought the end had come. To see the Astronomican falter, even for a second, seemed impossible..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","When the light of the Astronomican flickered, I thought my mind may fracture. The Noctis Aeterna that followed was worse still."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","Much was lost during the Noctis Aeterna. I doubt we'll ever know the full extent - which is just how certain parties prefer it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","I still have visions of the darkest times... For all the horror of its creation, I would not be without the Astronomican's light ever again..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Yes. Would it kill some of them to wash?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","Yes. The Mourningstar is gaining a rather distinct ... odour."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","Nothing but ruffians and wastrels. I was meant for better."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","I really though I'd be keeping better company by now."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","You expect an Inquisitor to be straightforward and open? Hah!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","Does the weapon ever know much about the hand that wields it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","It's natural to feel some discomfort. Answers will come in time, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","The Imperium is generous with mystery, and frugal with answers. This is nothing new."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_01","Is the situation is so dire, surely Grendyl should be here in person?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_02","If this war is going so badly, why does Grendyl not take direct charge?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_03","Grendyl seems to keep Atoma at arm's length."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_04","If Atoma is so important, why does Grendyl not take more of an active role?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","The Inquisitor must have many concerns. It may be that Atoma is the least of them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","I suspect Inquisitor's web of responsibility stretches far from Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","I don't see how any of this speculation helps our current situation."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","Why are we wasting valuable breath on this topic?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","There we go ... Looking for a way to ingratiate yourself. Grendyl barely knows you exist. If at all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","You have narrow way of regarding the world, Fanatic. It's ... unbecoming."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Devout or distant, we will fight and die all the same. What choice do we have?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","None of this will change our fate. We are but cogs in an uncaring machine."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_four_b_01","I find that ... unlikely."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_four_b_02","I understand her, of course, but then I do have an incomparable mind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_four_c_01","The Brute clearly has untapped potential. Which is more than I can say for some."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_four_c_02","The Brute is clearly an asset. I shall try to be nicer."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I'm sorry, were you asking me to favour one blunt over another?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_one_b_02","I find her directness rather refreshing ... Even if she is full of herself."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_one_c_01","Honestly, you should probably worry more about me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Ah, she's nothing to worry about ... unless you have an irrational fear of precision."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_a_01","I do find the Tech-Priest's thoughts hard to read."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_a_02","The Tech-Priest's mind is ordered, yet impenetrable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_a_03","The Tech-Priest orders her thoughts with painful precision."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_a_04","Poking around the Tech-Priest's head is like strolling blindfold through a technical manual."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I trust you were careful. You don't want to get caught."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Not so loud! She might be listening!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_c_01","Ach! Where's the harm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_three_c_02","You worry too much."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Her soul does seem to have withered a good deal, it's true."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Her soul is shrivelled and bitter. Much like mine."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_two_c_01","It hardly matters how long a lifetime of suffering lasts. That the suffering exists is what should concern us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hadron_two_c_02","I intend to live a long, sinful life ... assuming I make it through this war."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","Did you ask yourself why she always has vacancies? Hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","Dead men's shoes, hmmm? And there are such a lot of shoes to fill."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","I think you would be very foolish to choose that course ... But then, of course, you are."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Wiser to stay where you are, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","Really? Do tell."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","The purser? Oh, I would believe anything of her."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","You don't want to know what happened to the last fellow who stole from her stores."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","She has a very ... colourful ... way of dealing with thieves. Quite loud, too."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_01","The purser's prices are a touch ... extravagant, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_02","I cannot believe the purser's prices. Excessive doesn't begin to do them justice."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_03","The purser must think me a fool to accept her prices as they are."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_04","The purser must think we are all made of aquilas to charge as she does."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","I would negotiate with her ... but that stare [Shudders]."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","I for one do not wish to antagonise her over mere commerce."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Ach, trinkets and baubles interest me little anyway. I am purer than that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","It is just as well that I am above flimsy gewgaws and tacky coin-grubbing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","She's personable enough. Unlike some I might mention."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Yes, well ... she is a little rough around the edges."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","I'm not saying that I enjoy her company, of course. I wouldn't want to mislead."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She'd not exactly be my first choice for a dinner companion."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","A hive city is a physical representation of Imperial society. The privileged few look down from on high upon the teeming masses."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","At the very top, you'll find the highborns. Those not born into wealth earn it from the toil of the common worker."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","You'll find the noble houses are often patrons of the Ecclesiarchy. Remember, all of us are judged, but some more than others."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","It's the middle you have to watch out for. It's where the enforcers reside, ensuring everybody stays in their appointed place."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Most of the time they simply fight amongst themselves."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Most gang violence comes from turf wars and other petty squabbles."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Those who have only known the yoke of tyranny can dream only of a chance to crack the whip."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","The temptation to visit violence upon these wayward souls is strong: But remember that's precisely what drove them to the crimelords to start with."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_01","Hive-cities are indicative of a crumbling Imperium. Billions crammed into spaces unfit for habitation, the secrets of their construction lost to time."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_02","If ever you wish to experience every form of human degradation, depravity and despair, look you to the hive cities."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_03","Too many souls suffering ill treatment, a ruling class who cares not, and too few enforcers per head. Hive-cities are a breeding ground for insurrection."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_04","Hive-cities are much like their namesakes. Billions of good little drones all working themselves to death for an unknowable Emperor."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","I hear a typical hab-unit is but three metres square. A cold, unforgiving cell that generations call home."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","There is no privacy in a hive. No time when a hiver is not shoulder-to-shoulder with their fellows. Imagine being a nascent psyker in such a place."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","If Tertium is the best example of the Atoman hives, I pity the wretches who inhabit the others."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","I would hazard that those who dwell spireside have no such squalor with which to contend."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Control of these manufactorums will tip the balance of power in this sector. That's the real reason we're here."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","If it weren't for the inherent value of the manufactorums, Grendyl would have ordered an orbital strike on Hive Tertium by now."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","Imagine spending a life toiling at blistering forges and breathing acrid air, only to earn death in a senseless battle."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","Metalfabs are quite soulless. Maybe it's the servitors. Maybe it's because the heretics have murdered all the workers."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_four_b_02","On Terra, they ring the Bell of Lost Souls when heroes die. We'll be lucky if they get our names right on the grave-marker."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_four_c_01","We should just count our blessings anyone even remembers where they left us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_four_c_02","I can see it now. You and me, up there on the roll of honour alongside Solar Macharius himself..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_one_b_01","If I ever reach Terra, it will be as sacrifice to your Carrion Lord. Forgive me for not being so eager."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_one_b_02","Oh no, Roughneck. If my kind go to Terra, we do not return."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_one_c_01","I am as close as I ever want to get to your Emperor, thank you very much."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_one_c_02","I am content where I am. Less chance of having my brain leak out of my ears this way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_a_01","I wonder how Atoma pays its tithe to your ""beneficent"" Emperor? Unfairly, and harshly, I'd guess."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_a_02","You speak of a great and benevolent Imperium, but so many worlds are crippled by unfair tithes."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_a_03","We're only restoring Atoma so it can start paying a crippling tithe, and you know it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_a_04","Have you ever heard of a world that actually benefits from the Imperial Tithe? It is a travesty."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_b_01","There are many who revere the tithe. The cretins embrace their own suffering, and give thanks for it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_b_02","The tithe exists to keep the worlds outside the Terran heartlands in their place. That is all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_c_01","When a world cannot pay, governors are executed. Populations are conscripted. And you call this fair."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Payment comes not through duty, but through fear of reprisal. The Imperium is built upon brutality."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_two_b_01","And all of them filled with running, and fighting, and screaming. Lots of screaming."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_two_b_02","It seems the Carrion Lord's thirst for war knows no bounds."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_two_c_01","So many wonders, and I must spend my life battling horrors in a squalid Hive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_imperium_two_c_02","If I get half a chance, I'll run to the world farthest from all this death."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","They have a habit of killing leaders without thought of consequence. Perhaps they've been here already."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","It would barely surprise me to learn they've been here already. Perhaps we're to clean up the mess they made."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","Funny. I always thought my life might be ended by a Culexus Assassin. Now I do their work for them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Imagine spending all this time doing the Emperor's dirty work, just for a Culexus Assassin to turn my brains to mush."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","The cost of an orbital bombardment is worth more than the lives of every man, woman and child on this accursed world."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","There must be something of value here, or they'd have done it already."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","How easily you consider extinguishing the lives of millions."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Do you really think they'd bother to evacuate us first? Careful what you wish for..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_01","So strange... A lifetime of tyranny under Imperial Law, now to find myself above it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_02","Being above Imperial Law is a singular advantage of joining the Inquisition. A small mercy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_03","One barely understands the true unfairness of Imperial Law until one stands above it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_04","It seems that we in the Inquisition enforce Imperial Law whilst standing above it ourselves."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","I suppose I could take some small satisfaction in terrorising errant enforcers... Were I the vengeful sort."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","The shoe is indeed on the other foot. I would give much for the local enforcers to test my patience now..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","The Lex Imperialis was written by Man. Man is fallible. Thus, the Lex is fallible, no?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","Strange, is it not, how malleable Imperial Law can be when it suits not the needs of the powerful?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","Our order is certainly feared. Probably due to all the hunting and burning of innocents."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Oddly enough, working for people who call themselves ""Witch Hunters"" is hardly my idea of fulfilling employment."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","Those you call ""Witch""... ""Mutant""... ""Traitor"". How many has Grendyl put to death I wonder?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","I have heard of entire worlds being scoured by our order for the mere suspicion of mutation. Very noble."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","I know not how it functions, Brute, but I can tell you how it is powered: by the souls of innocents."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","It is a tower of ancient machinery, powered by souls, and guarded by the ignorant."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","The Golden Throne is a prison for its maker, and a device of torture for its attendants."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","All I know is, the Golden Throne hungers, and its appetite becomes more voracious with each passing day."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","The man in the polished gold armour, with a battleship named after himself? Someone was overcompensating."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Was his favoured tactic not orbital bombardment? No matter how much of the native population were slain? Very heroic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","Men like that don't just get sick and die. That's just what the Adeptus Terra want you to think..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","I heard he met an ignominious end. I think it more likely he got on the wrong side of the Officio Assassinorum."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_01","When I think of all the eras past, and knowledge lost, I conclude surely we're in the Age of Ignorance."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_02","What an age of ignorance we dwell in, that knowledge of past eras is disregarded as heresy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_03","A pity the Great Awakening led not to true enlightenment. Still we cling to ignorance, ignoring the lessons of the past."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_04","The Imperium is built on superstition and myth - you cretins are afraid to learn from the past."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Let them repeat the mistakes of the past. They'll bring about a new Age of Strife before they're done."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","We stand on the cusp of a new Age of Strife, yet our masters are too timid to learn history's lessons."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","We're wasting our breath. Some would rather pray to a Warp engine than learn its function."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","The Imperium began with an Age of Progress... Now it seems ""progress"" is considered sinful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","It really is a matter of perspective, and whether you think the right side won."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","Interesting priorities you have there, Fanatic. I'd have thought the Horus Heresy might be a teensy bit more tragic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Sebastian Thor overthrew Vandire... But was not Thor also accused of heresy? I lose track of all the corruption."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Well, I for one cannot celebrate the survival of the Ecclesiarchy, in any form."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_four_b_01","Yes, yes, yes. Loyalty forgives all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_four_b_02","Loyalty is the highest coin in the Imperium, when it should be truth."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_four_c_01","Some are born to servitude. Others have it thrust upon them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_four_c_02","Better to push datawork in heaven than serve in hel."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_one_b_01","You're surely not talking of the Lord Darius Melk, scion of the noble House Straxamus? Not with that tone, anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_one_b_02","My apologies, but I only know a Lord Darius Melk, the peerless crystallographic watercolourist and mentor."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_one_c_01","No wonder you don't get on. You don't offer the proper form of address."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_one_c_02","Careless of you to forget the title. Try to remember it next time."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_a_01","Sire Melk pretends superiority, but I suspect he is no more or less a criminal than we."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_a_02","I wonder what secrets Sire Melk conceals? Hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_a_03","Sire Melk surely has secrets. I wonder what they are."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_a_04","Sire Melk cannot be as blameless as he seems. I mean, look at the company he keeps."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_b_01","Quite literally a great many skeletons in cupboards, no doubt."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_b_02","Dear me. Bureaucratic skulduggery is so very tedious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_c_01","It's not really surprising. An Inquisitor's greatest power is leverage."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_three_c_02","The more I learn about this crew, the more Grendyl is shown to be either desperate, or a romantic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_two_b_01","You must admit, you can be ... a touch inconsistent."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_two_b_02","He is a scholar, so naturally he expects more precision than you provide."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_two_c_01","Perhaps Melk would tutor you ... if you asked him nicely?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_melk_two_c_02","Melk merely confirmed what I have long suspected."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_four_b_01","You are credulous, Brute. Never gamble."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Really, Brute. Is there anything you will not believe?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Pfah! So Morrow is a little inhuman. That's to be celebrated, not sneered at."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_four_c_02","From what I've seen of humanity we might all be better off thus."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Really? Is there anywhere that man has not been?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Ah! The ring of verisimilitude!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Can't we talk about something more interesting?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_one_c_02","What is this fascination with the sergeant, anyway? I'm sure he's not worth it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_a_01","Don't you think it is strange that there are so many impossible stories about Morrow's past accomplishments?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_a_02","Morrow's past is full of embellishments ... Do you not agree?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_a_03","All these stories about Morrow. Obvious lies, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_a_04","Surely these stories about Morrow cannot be true. You concur, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_b_01","You should not listen to rumours, Sibling. Unless I start them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_b_02","What does it matter? What does he matter?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_c_01","The galaxy is full of preposterous tales. Often, the most unlikely are the truest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_three_c_02","You could always ask Morrow directly ... if you dare ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Oh yes, anyone can see he's an ancient wreck, tottering about."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_two_b_02","He looks unusually hale for a man of such weighty years, does he not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Any simpleton can see it's a story to gull the credulous ... Well, almost any simpleton."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_morrow_two_c_02","It is a bare-faced invention. Can you not see that?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Form over function has never impressed me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Alas, I favour efficiency over lavish decoration."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","Alas, voidships alone will not win this war."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Even vessels such as this cannot prevail against what is coming."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_four_b_01","A mind like his would be wasted in the meat grinder. I should know."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Some of us are better suited to oversight than front line battle. I envy him."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_four_c_01","You do worry about the strangest things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_four_c_02","Why concern yourselves with something you cannot affect?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He's a calculating man. Never takes a risk. Obsessed with data."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_one_b_02","He's the sort that would render the world to certainties, if he could."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Ach, why worry? It will all be the same in a hundred years. We'll all be food for the worms."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_one_c_02","If you want him to like you, maybe you should give him a present. I'm sure that will work."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_a_01","Whispers abound that Rannick is destined for greater things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_a_02","The Mourningstar is full of rumour ... that Rannick's star is on the rise."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_a_03","Rannick is a man to watch ... at least, so I hear."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_a_04","Interrogator Rannick seems meant for higher things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_b_01","It is said that Inquisitors are not born, but forged through trial. Grendyl may intend Atoma to be Rannick's trial."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Perhaps Grendyl is growing old, and fears leaving his work undone with no successor to see it completed?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_c_01","One thing is certain: Rannick's fate is bound to that of this world, for good or ill."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_three_c_02","Rannick and Atoma are now entwined. As are we. I don't think I like that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Oh, the horror! This calls for immediate execution. You should tell him so."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Not everyone wears their obsessions as plainly as you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_two_c_01","I imagine that as long as Rannick gets results, no one save you will care."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_rannick_two_c_02","I refuse to believe that he could rise so high while defying the Emperor's glory."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Their souls are leaden and dull. Whatever they once were is long stripped away."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_servitors_one_b_02","They are echoes of life, bound to wires and circuitry. I find them ... distasteful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_servitors_one_c_01","In the end, we're all just components, waiting for repurposing. The trick lies in staying useful as you are."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_servitors_one_c_02","Brutal practicality in action. If you cannot serve in your current form, someone will find you another."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Genetic modification, how else? Probably painful. Explains their sunny disposition."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","I hear they get implanted with an organ called a Biscopea. I expect it's very painful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","I heard they can gain a creature's memory by eating its flesh. And you call me the freak!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","Seven feet tall, solid ribcage, near-immortal... But yes, tell me again why I'm the mutant?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Forgive my lack of enthusiasm, but the Adeptus Astartes are even less tolerant of my kind than the Imperial Guard."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","Wonderful. I might live to get purged by a seven-foot-tall power-armoured tyrant. Can't wait."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Strange how some augmentations are venerated, yet others reviled."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","Are Space Marines truly human? If not, why do you hero-worship them so? Strange, is it not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_01","Can it really be true that Roboute Guilliman has returned? It barely seems possible."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_02","If Roboute Guilliman really is back, it must presage some great calamity."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_03","If Roboute Guilliman is truly back, the future will be bleak indeed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_04","It seems not possible that Roboute Guilliman has returned... Is it a blessing, or a curse?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","I expect he'll be worshipped as a god soon. Another superhuman tyrant in whose name worlds will burn."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","Maybe all the Primarchs will come back. The good ones and the bad ones. That'll be fun."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","All this talk about the purity of humanity. Yet now we're led by a giant from another era..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Some might call a man like that ""mutant"". Put him in power armour and he's suddenly a saviour."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","The Codex served its purpose, but now it's just another dogma to replace a lack of pragmatism."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Does not current wisdom hold the Codex as a tool of blind dogma? Something you'd know all about."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","One must display grudging respect for those Chapters who deviated from Guilliman's dictates."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","The Codex Astartes is sacrosanct... And yet many chapters deviate from its teachings. Curious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_surgeon_one_c_01","Oh ... You should let me tell you about what's in our rations ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_surgeon_one_c_02","Take my advice ... Don't look at your rations too closely."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","They would have us believe he is a god, though I fancy he's little more than a shrivelled cadaver."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","A shrivelled, rotting corpse. A carrion-lord, terrible to behold."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Perhaps those who've undertaken the Soul-Binding have seen his face... If only we could ask them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","I fear we shall all see His face in the next life, and it will be terrible to behold."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","If he is as powerful as they say, one word from his shrivelled lips would tear apart your tiny minds."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He has given but one command in ten thousand years: to maintain the Imperium, no matter the cost."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","The Inquisitor Lords claim to know the Emperor's will, but we all know it's the High Lords of Terra who rule."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","We're to believe only the Senatorum Imperialis know his inscrutable will. How convenient."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_01","The Emperor survives on human flesh and human blood... His Imperium likewise."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_02","You exalt the Emperor, yet forgive the sacrifice of souls made in His name each and every day."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_03","I offer no praise to the Emperor. He is a carrion-lord, who feasts upon the souls of my kind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_04","How many souls are consumed by the Emperor each day? And yet we exalt Him?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","The Astronomican binds together the Imperium, but at the cost of untold millions."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","They say without the light of the Astronomican, the Imperium would crumble. Would that be so bad?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","If it weren't for Grendyl, I'd probably be just another morsel for the carrion lord. Not sure which fate is worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","What was it they taught us at training camp? The fate of the Mutant is to be cleansed? How comforting..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","The Golden Throne is a prison - not just for the Emperor, but for us all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","Ah, yes. All of us shackled to this monolithic regime should be thankful for the Emperor's carelessness."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","They say if the Emperor fails, all life will end. But while he endures, do any of us truly live?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","If he'd had the good grace to simply die, perhaps Mankind could have found its own way in the universe."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Psykers - who you're meant to hate - create a big beacon, which special mutants - who you're also meant to hate - can follow. You follow?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","The Empyrean calls to us with honeyed whispers, and Mankind - being fuelled by greed - answers eagerly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","I would tell you of the thousand psykers sacrificed each day to the Astronomican, but the others wouldn't like that..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Warp travel, like all the Imperium's advancements, is made possible through death and suffering."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","The things you fear in the Immaterium are the very things I confront every waking hour."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","Be thankful you only have to fear the Warp between missions. For me, the terrors of the Warp are the mission."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","[Tsk] And to think our creed takes such a dim view of mutation, when it is the Navis Nobilite who deliver us safely through the Warp."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","Each time we hurl ourselves into the Empyrean, we put our lives in the hands of the Navigators."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_01","It is somewhat vexatious, is it not, how time flows differently in the Warp?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_02","The vagaries of time displacement within the Empyrean are truly beyond even my keen intellect."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_03","Each time we gaze into the Empyrean, the erratic flow of time seems more disconcerting."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_04","Time is erratic within the Empyrean... It is hard to calculate how long each jump truly takes."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","The Warp is a strange and terrible place. Time is the least of your worries."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Be thankful to emerge from the Warp at all. Many a traveller has been cast adrift for eternity on the Sea of Souls."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","You imagine the Empyrean as merely a void, but it is a living ocean, full of tides, storms... and predators."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","I have heard tell, but once, of a vessel emerging from the Warp before it had begun its journey."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","You realise that Warp entities are creatures given form by your own thoughts? Everyone brings their own ghosts into the Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Warp entities are your fears made manifest. And they dwell in the Empyrean long after your passing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Oh, if only you knew what dread hands clawed at the hull during each journey, you'd never make a Warp-jump again."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","The very power that guides a vessel through the Empyrean attracts these spectres like moths to a flame."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","A very sensible stance, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Indeed? The Brute shows some taste."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","I think it's comradely. I approve."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","Well, Ogryns and Psykers are the future, after all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","I don't know what you mean. She's perfectly civil."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Ah yes, the narrow mind of the blunt on display once more."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","I don't wish to appear uncaring ... but alas, I am."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Such a lot of bother over nothing ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_01","I had a delightful conversation with Sefoni earlier."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_02","That Sefoni! She really does have a way with words."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_03","I had a truly splendid conversation with Sefoni earlier. What a charmer!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_04","I think Sefoni might be the only soul on the Mourningstar who matches my intellect."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","She is a delight, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Such a sparkling soul. I am in awe."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","She has a remarkable sense of humour ... Though you may not be able to appreciate it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Such a mind! Dextrous and sharpened to a razor point."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","You should consider yourself fortunate to have such a diligent mentor."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","She is dedicated, direct and very efficient. I do not see the concern."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","I think the Fanatic believes Sefoni's place is on a pyre ... alongside all my kind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","You really need to work on your anti-psyker bigotry. I might take offence."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_01","I swear, the worst part of all this is the orbital drop."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_02","I hate everything about this life, but the orbital drop is the very worst!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_03","I loathe deploying for a mission. So noisy! So stomach-wrenching!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_04","I wish our pilot would fly smoother! I have a delicate constitution."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","I know what you mean. I suspect Masozi aims for air pockets. She has a peculiar sense of humour."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","Yes. It's all very uncivilised."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Well, I suppose we haven't yet exploded, so it could be worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","My incomparable mind deserves better treatment ... not that anyone cares."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_war_end_b_01","Wars seldom end cleanly, Brute. They simply change locale."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_war_end_b_02","From certain perspectives, this war has been raging for ten millennia. It is eternal."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_war_end_c_01","Strife is humanity's beating heart. There will never be peace."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_war_end_c_02","There is only war. Now and forever."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_four_b_01","Yes ... Her appearance does not do her credit."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_four_b_02","I have known many like her. All came to a bad end."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_four_c_01","Let us hope she's not ... unexpectedly brittle."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_four_c_02","Strength of purpose and strength of character are not the same thing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_one_b_01","She is a study in contradictions, certainly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_one_b_02","You should see inside her head ... Or so I'm told."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_one_c_01","While she holds authority over us, our mere opinions hardly matter."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_one_c_02","All irrelevant. She holds power of life and death. We have no choice but to obey."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_a_01","Zola's manner is a muddle. Cultured and common ... though she hides the latter."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_a_02","Zola is a curious creature, born of the gutter and the spires."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_a_03","Zola ... is an interesting mix of contradictions, I find."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_a_04","Zola is a most intriguing soul. So many ambitions, fighting for dominance."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_b_01","She is dangerous. And perhaps not to us alone."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_b_02","She walks a dangerous line. Then again, who around here does not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_c_01","Personally. I would very much like to examine her brain. In detail."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_three_c_02","She makes for a fascinating test subj-- superior, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_two_b_01","I prefer to see the world as it is ... unclogged by incense."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_two_b_02","Faith is but the hope of a dream that too often begets nightmare."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_two_c_01","The lost will often follow any light, wherever it leads."
"loc_psyker_female_a__lore_zola_two_c_02","Faith is well enough, but it does so easily become mania."
"loc_psyker_female_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Fetch. Carry. Is it too much to ask for some help?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","I have one!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_alarm_01","Oh look, a heretic summoning cacophony. How nice!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_alarm_02","Where is that wretched alarm anyway?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","Closed. Of course it is!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","I don't want to be naysayer - well actually I do, but you don't appreciate it - but that door is very closed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","Not everything written down is valuable. Quality is always superior to quantity."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","So many words. So much data. So little wisdom."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","I'm sure this data will expose many traitors. Or those who are said to be so."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","I find the burden of proof falls differently once the words ""heresy"" is uttered."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","The effort that went into this archivum. I'm sure a series of boxes would do just as well."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","This archivum is unnecessarily grandiose, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","What a delight! I always dreamed of visiting a place like this ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Oh, you are spoiling us. What a treat this mission has already become ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Retrieval via the air seems needless. We should simply steal the train."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Why can we not simply drive the train to a new location?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Very well. We'll do it your way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Oh far be it from me to question your almighty wisdom ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Are you another indentured servant, Tech Priest, or a willing soldier?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Did you choose this path, Tech Priest? Or was it chosen for you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","So many words. So little information."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Ah, unearned superiority. How familiar."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","One trusts our support team won't abandon us?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Who truly believes this support team will be here in time?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Very reassuring. You give a warm glow inside."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh, I will stop worrying then, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Toil without thought or reward. The Imperium would make us all machines, if it could."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","It is not for want of activity that Atoma falls."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","How do we even know we're going the right way?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","Admit it! We're lost!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Death still lingers in this place. Desperation is thick upon the air."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Can you not feel the death in this place? The torment?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","If there are so many soldiers already here, why are we needed?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","Yes, of course! Send the psyker in to do the fighting while the soldiers watch!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Criminals. Pfah. Always praying on the weak."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Braggarts and bullies always cling to pomp and pagentry. I doubt the cartel was any different."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Temper, temper, explicator. That's hardly the dispassion Grendyl expects, is it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","I'm sure there are a few gunhands left that you could hunt down and … chastise."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","It strikes me as peculiar that the Water Cartel were so easily subverted."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","So, for all their bravado, the Water Cartel collapsed from within."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","So noted. Let the knowledge serve us well."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Lesser minds often make elementary mistakes."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I'm intrigued. You were once a pauper and a criminal, and now you are an Inquisitor's hand? How?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","That you thrived in this place is a testament to your fortitude, explicator."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Touchy, aren't you? Brittle pride is the very worst."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","You should have a care with secrets. Nothing rots the soul more swiftly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Cartel or administratum, the craven revel in symbols to hide their vulnerability."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Iconography is often a shield, concealing weakness of mind and purpose. The Water Cartel is no different."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","They're using the tarpaulins to filter the water. Very ingenious. Very … pitiable, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","Humanity should not be reduced to scavenging polluted waters … even if they are Blunts."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","Crumbling. But then, what corner of the Imperium is not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","To think, someone was once proud of these buildings. No accounting for taste, is there?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","We've reached the bazaar. The only trade now is in death."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","Less a point of trade and more of an arena, would you not say?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_shanty_01","What a revolting place. I should not be subjected to such sights!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_shanty_02","You want the Emperor's truth? It is all around us. Behold the destiny of Mankind!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_water_course_01","That's no river! I wonder what would get me first: the toxins or the acids?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cartel_water_course_02","I don't know what's worse about the river: the smell, or the stinging sensation in my eyes!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Why are these wretched elevators never on the right floor?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Oh good! Another fight to the death while the elevator whirrs!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Well, this is all very cloak and dagger. And probably pointless."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","I suppose it's nice to be trusted with something important ... or would be if we knew why."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","What a surprise. I'm so shocked I can barely stand. Truly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Well, I'm sure that won't end in tears."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","I note we've not been told who is receiving this transmission."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","So, we're just shooting a secret message out into space ... is that it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Oooh ... Tantalising. I'm sure the truth is deathly tedious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","Well, I'm no wiser than before, but still wiser than you by an order of magnitude."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","I imagine this message is important only to tiny minds."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","Only a stunted mind would care what was in this message, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Yes, I'm sure that's what you were told, anyway ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Your explanation has the ring of obfuscation."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Does anyone else have a bad feeling about this mission?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","The company I keep will be the death of me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_way_in_01","That's us ... Always with the grand entrances ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_complex_way_in_02","Well, at least it's not the ventilation system, the sewer, a chimney, a body bag ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","The damage appears extensive. Is it irreparable?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Hmmm … Those heretics have inflicted a great deal of damage. Can it be repaired?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","I think that was a 'yes'."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","I believe there was a 'yes' buried in there somewhere."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I've only heard talk of salvaging the building. What about those who laboured within?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The building may yet find salvation, but those who toiled here …? Are they of no account?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That's the caring Imperium I know and love. A place for everyone."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Heroes today. Fodder tomorrow. Imperial bureaucracy at its finest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Given how Rannick's forces are overstretched, I assume this facility is vital?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","All this trouble. This facility must be more important than I assumed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","So we're not so expendable as Rannick would have us believe? At least, not today."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","I suppose it's nice to be needed … even if only by default."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_heat_01","Well, this temperature is most uncivilised, I must say. Just like everything else around here."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_leaving_01","At last! Air that doesn't taste of burning!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_leaving_02","Good riddance to the place. I hope never to return."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Hiking in a power complex? Not how I'd have chosen to spend the day."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Don't you dare try to push me over the edge! I'm watching you!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","I swear this wretched place grows hotter the deeper we get."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","Are we not yet at Coolant Control? No? Very well, let us proceed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Crude armour plating. Then again, crudity is the lifeblood of the Imperium."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_production_line_02","I suppose that armour plating has a simple, uncomplicated charm."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","This manufactorum holds nothing in the way of comfort. Not that I am surprised."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Lacks the homely touch, wouldn't you say, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_deception_01","This mission calls for subtlety, but I've no doubt it'll turn into a bloodbath."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_deception_02","This is a mission for stealth, intellect and guile. Why they sent you lot, I've no idea."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","There never was much justice in this place."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Ah, all the trappings of false justice. It's the same everywhere."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","So quickly the trappings of law and order fall into decay."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","This place has seen many owners, none of them generous souls."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Justice is a fleeting concept, I find."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Suffering is the Imperium's hardiest crop."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","I sense that this place troubles you, explicator."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Your thoughts are wrathful and dark, explicator. Do you need a hug?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I do so hate vague answers. Shameful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","How tantalising. How worthless as a reply."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","One should never ask why vermin nest where they do, but still I am curious: why a prison?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","It seems to me that our target has already imprisoned himself."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Ah, the side of the Imperium few see..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Like the Imperium, the hab may be solid, but its supports are hollow."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","I have hidden in many places like this. But only out of need."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","You would surprised how little the authorities pay heed to such places."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","Ah, the underbelly of civilisation... if you want to call it that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","A fascinating aroma. Very 'lived in'. Or possibly 'smothered by'."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","I would trust no business transacted here."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","A squalid corner and a den of misfits."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","I don't care for the angle of this floor."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","Yes, this looks very structurally sound."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_alive_01","The machine rouses!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_alive_02","The machine stirs! Keep at it!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Why is this manufactorum so important? Enquiring minds wish to know."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Why are we even here. Are Leman Russ tanks so rare?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","A foolish pursuit. You'd do better to harness incomparable minds such as my own."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Hah! They are still naught when compared to a telekinetic shield!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I know much about Zola, and even Morrow ... but very little about you, Tech Priest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","You're very secretive, Tech Priest. Surely there's something about yourself you can share?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","You see? That wasn't so hard, was it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Well, I suppose we shouldn't have expected better."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Is it me, or do the heretics take an unnecessarily complicated approach to sabotage?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Strange that our enemies should commit so mild a sabotage."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I knew it! Things can always get worse!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Perhaps it would be kinder to destroy the place while we're here, yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","I suppose we'd better find this smelter."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","If we don't find the smelter, Morrow will never let us hear the end of it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Can't ... Breathe ... Again ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_hellhole_02","My throat's ... Burning ... We have to leave."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_lifeless_01","The machine slumbers, and waits only to rouse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_lifeless_02","It's almost pitiable to see the machinery becalmed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","We're making a frontal assault? How thrilling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","We're marching up to the front gate? Whatever happened to guile?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_propaganda_01","See how readily mankind is reduced to toiling drones? Buzz. Buzz. Buzz."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_propaganda_02","Those who queue in this place are not workers. They're fuel."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Here they come! No surrender, no retreat!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Can that elevator not travel any faster?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","The air ... So bitter ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","I cannot ... breathe ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","I suspect there is more to this place's importance than we have been told."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Surely one manufactorum cannot make so much difference?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_hack_01","Servitors and machines do not reason, so they are easily outwitted. Much like the rest of you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_hack_02","Try not to drop your data-interrogators. You will need them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","A crude settlement for crude beings."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","I have lived in worse places, though not willingly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I sense something... terrible. Why?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","There is... something crawling at my mind..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Well, I suppose that explains that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I suppose it slipped everyone's mind. Those that have them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","You might explain why the daemon is here."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I suppose the reason for the daemon's presence is a mystery?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","So much for the Imperium's eternal vigilance."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","I suspected as much, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Let us hope the daemonic matter is not widespread."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","I trust the daemon is contained in this area?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I think I'd like to go back to my cell now."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","You needn't sound so cheerful. That's horrible."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Cretins? I think the stairs will be a more suitable conveyance."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","Call me squeamish, but I'm not risking that elevator."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","My incomparable mind is proof against all heretic manipulations, I assure you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","A psychic pathogen to go along with the physical? Interesting, but far-fetched."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I will be staying away from ledges. I am allergic to sharp drops."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","By the Five Rusting Spires, how high are we now?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Why must we always walk so far? I imagine Rannick flies everywhere."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Another long walk awaits, I imagine. As usual."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","The air is dry and bitter. I empathise."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","The air almost tastes clean up here. I'm sure it's not, but I can dream."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Ach! Too bright. Can't we go back inside?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","I don't care for all this sunlight. It's... unhealthy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","They've sealed the doors!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","The heretics have sealed us in!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","We're trapped! The doors are sealed!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","We're locked in! This isn't going to be good!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Hello? Mourningstar? ... It's no good. They're jamming the vox!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Mourningstar? Mourningstar! This dratted vox isn't working!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Mourningstar? ... Oh splendid, the vox isn't working!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar! We're trapped! Mourningstar! ... Useless vox!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Just keep fighting! What else can we do?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","Oh good, a last stand. And it seemed like such a nice day."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","Well this is going entirely to plan ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","We're all going to die in here. I hope you realise that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_district_gate_01","The District Gate is sealed. How swiftly a home becomes a cage."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_district_gate_02","So the heretics closed the District Gate? Or was it the authorities attempting containment?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Ah, another bastion of Imperial bureaucracy. I'm not impressed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","This place looks important. Then again, ostentatiousness is the order of things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Then Hive security should have fought harder to hold it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","That's the trouble with ruling through force. Someone's always stronger."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You have detailed knowledge of this place, explicator?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","I sense you know a great deal more about this district, explicator."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","We all of us do what we must to survive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","So we are all of us fugitives, is that so?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What need have I for tricksy ammunition when I have my incomparable mind?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","I don't see why a few trick bullets matter so much."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Fine. Keep your toys. See where it gets you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh no, I'm overwrought. However shall I kill heretics now? With my mind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","Let's avoid the hab block. Hab blocks mean crowds."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","We seem to be taking the long way around ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","Dark and dingy. Well, at least the gloom matches my mood ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Crawling through the dark. Again. I was meant for better."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_trains_01","This is not my first time in the Imperium's glorious bowels."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_rails_trains_02","I've lived in worse places than this."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Let's not play hide and seek with the heretics, please."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","Do try not to get lost, cretins."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Screaming hordes on one side, and on the other A BROKEN BRIDGE!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","Can't this thing move any faster?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","What a reassuring name. It's right up there with ""Pit of Death""."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","I'm sure nothing bad will happen to us on a bridge named thus. Nothing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","Why is nothing ever easy?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","Details, details, details. That's always where we go wrong."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","This is going to get nasty!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","We are definitely earning our substandard pay today!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Why can't they simply accept their defeat?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","These witless fools are no threat to me! Hah!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","A pulpit, but no sign of it's preacher. What an absolute shame."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","The usual ranter is absent from his pulpit, I see."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","No loss, though I'm sure it's not polite to say."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","The heretics have probably done the residents a favour."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Very seemly. But scratch the surface and there's something nasty beneath."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","The mask of dignity is the favoured headgear in these streets."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_retrieve_01","I do hope you're not expecting me to do any of the heavy lifting?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_retrieve_02","I'll be sure to leave the heavy lifting to you brutes. I was made for finer things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scan_01","A scanning mission? I was meant for better things."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scan_02","A scanning mission? Why bother? The Imperium has grown strong on ignoring truths."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","I prefer Downside to this place. The air is so … dry. And one can grow bored of bright lights."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Is this to be our existence now? Crawling in the darkness or blinded by the radioactive corona of a dying world?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Just like the Imperium to abandon something perfectly useful in the name of convenience. Has it been like this long?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","This whole place is a testament to the Imperium's carelessness. How long has it been thus?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","The heretics are welcome to it, I think."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Let the heretics keep the wretched place, for all I care."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I shouldn’t be here. What use is my incomparable mind in the business of exterminating plagues?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Plague eradication is the business of medicae specialists, not folk such as we."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Rotten little minds in rotten little bodies. But then, so many blunts are thus."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","You need to work harder at being reassuring."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","As a trading port, I imagine this place would have been crowded, at its height?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","You can barely tell this used to be a trader's port, but the signs are there, if you have the wit to see them."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","I'm sure those with wealth and privilege endured the decline. They always do."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","The influential will have survived such times while the powerless perished. Such tales always repeat themselves."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_interior_01","I suppose the place has a certain … dilapidated charm."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Really? Is Morrow trying to get us all buried alive? … Of course he is."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","Ah. The fate of all bureaucracies and autocracies. Even Terra is not immune to entropy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","Hah! Gaze upon this mighty work, and behold the fate of the Administratum!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Hmmm… The cargo elevator has stopped moving. We can only hope it's in the right place."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","The cargo elevator's stopped. Did it get bored, or is it where we need it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","We should press on. I fear we will be overwhelmed down here."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","Too many entrances. Too many eyes. We should make haste!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_approach_01","Oh good. We're out in the open. Everyone in Chasm Terminus can see us ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_approach_02","There's the station. I honestly thought I'd be dead by now."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Just remember: I am to be protected at all costs!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","One of you is going to shoot me in the back, I just know it!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","Must you keep prattling on?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Please. Enough. Leave us to get this done."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I would like to know more about the gnarlbeast before I put my head in his mouth!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Is there anything useful you can tell us about the target?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Wonderful. Simply wonderful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","I don't why I expected anything else."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","Ah ... A place where heretics are sought and secrets exposed. Through the medium of pain, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","I find these catechizer posts fascinating. A place where monsters seek monsters, with the innocent caught between."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","This seems an elaborate plan. Surely there were simpler methods?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","To my incomparable mind, this plan reveals much about its architect."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","And so we retreat into threats and half-truths. Typical."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","So many words to say so little of value."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","I'm not surprised we're resorting to skulduggery. Honour is sadly out of fashion."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Ambushes and shooting people in the back is a time-honoured tradition, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","And when this enemy is defeated, there will be another deserving of such treatment. I've heard it all before."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","A familiar prayer, offered by the blindly obedient."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","It would have been much more efficient to perform the splice within the station itself."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Tell me again why we had to grub around in this vile place?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Blunts always make things too complicated."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Ah, yes. Mistaking complication for efficiency. Of course."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","Ah, the military life. Go here. Do nothing. Die."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","These soldiers don't seem very industrious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_station_hall_01","Barbarism! This was once a glorious edifice!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_station_station_hall_02","This poor, slighted building. Perhaps decay is inevitable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","Squalid. Not that I am surprised."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","This isn't a dwelling, but a nest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A daemon underfoot. What did I do to deserve this?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","A daemon is not to be taken lightly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Every day another surprise. Every day a little bit worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I aspire to that level of confidence. Truly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","This is most inefficient. Surely expelling the heretics is a more sensible course?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Why do we not simply drive the heretics out?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","I sense you'd prefer something swifter. And bloodier."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","You're impatient for something to change, I think."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","A body could feel safe down here. Away from the enforcers' cruel gaze..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The Torrent feels like it might once have been a haven for the oppressed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","A simplistic analysis, I suspect."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Ah. Life is always more complicated than it first appears."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","A gaudy statue in the bad part of town. How has it lasted this long?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","That statue seems out of place. Then again, so do we."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","Well, I'd say that looks blocked, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","I don't think we're getting in that way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","I would watch your footing. The floors are likely as bad as the walls."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Rotten. All of it. Disgusting."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Ah, what a delightful green glow. It just screams ""please drink me"", doesn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","This is where our drinking water comes from? I think I'm going to be sick..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","When that atmospheric shield falls the wind will cut us to pieces ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","Atmospheric shield? Once, perhaps. It's more like a net these days."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_crossroads_01","I don't suppose anyone brought a map?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Reach Flow Control, they said. It'll be easy, they said."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Can't you hear it? Deep, booming thoughts flowing like molasses across oil."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","The daemon knows we're here! I can ... feel it oozing through my thoughts."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","These have not been used in some time. There must be others."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","These aren't in use. Keep searching!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Matchless efficiency on every hand. Such a delight."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","Wonderful! I do so enjoy our little chats."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","How can you be so calm! This elevator sounds ready to fall!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I have a bad feeling about this elevator ride."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Oh, don't worry. I'm sure nothing will go wrong. Truly."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Ach! What's the worst that can happen?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Slaughter is always the first solution attempted ... but in this case, I think I agree."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","True. Sanctioned or heretical, belief is so difficult to quell, is it not?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Well, I wasn't expecting to fight a daemon today. Whatever next?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Daemons. Heretics. Imbeciles. Tell me this can't get worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Thank you. You've been a big help."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","How very reassuring. And useless."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","How can you all be so calm? We're walking into a plague factory!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","We're bound to be infected. You do know that, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","Yes, very easy for you to say, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Oh, I'm so very reassured by that."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","I cannot help but notice we've been told little about the pathogen."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","I wish our 'employer' was less secretive about the pathogen's nature ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Splendid. You will warn us if we're about to liquify, won't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","So it's all guesswork. How delightful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","Decay is our constant companion. Perhaps it is the fate of Mankind?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","This place's hour is long past. Twilight claims everything, sooner or later."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_01","Move, simpleton!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_02","Move, cretin!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_03","Don't just stand there!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_04","It's coming for you!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_05","It's coming!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_06","Get out of there!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_07","Run!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_08","Move!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_09","It's attacking!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_combo_attack_10","Look out!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","This will hurt."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Oh well done for finding this."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","I'm so very looking forward to this."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","I'm regretting having met any of you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Remind me again why I'm here?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","Well that's going to have to die."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","Well? After you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","So glad I came along tonight."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","Incredible. The night's getting even worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","Oh."
"loc_psyker_female_a__need_rescue_01","I suppose you're going to leave me behind?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__need_rescue_02","Don't just stand there, simpletons! Help me!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__need_rescue_03","Why won't you help me? Is it because I make you feel inferior?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__need_rescue_04","Rescue! I need rescue! At once!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__need_rescue_05","Yes, yes, yes. It's thrilling lying here, waiting for someone to care ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","Do we face a single entity, or several small ones?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","I can get no sense of scale for this daemonic entity. I'd really rather not read its thoughts..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","Delightful. As expected."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","Ah, the lost art of conversation blossoms anew ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","Only a fool would expect things to get better from here."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","This planet is falling into shadow and bleak laughter. Of course, I wouldn't expect a blunt to notice."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","Threatening us won't win this war."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","It was an honest observation. No need to get snippy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","It is scarcely rational to revere a god of pestilence. Hah."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","If one must offer worship, surely a benevolent god is preferable to a disease-bringer?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","Like avoiding being burned by leaping into the fire? [Sigh]"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","Well, there's no accounting for stupidity."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","Everywhere I keep hearing the same word. Nurgle, Nurgle, Nurgle."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","This name: Nurgle. It feels older than it should. Curious."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Words cannot hurt anyone. It's the actions that follow we should fear."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","Yes, on no account should we attempt to understand what we're up against."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","It beggars belief that Tertium can be rescued from its current state."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","I do not see how we can hope to purge the corruption from this hive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","Yes ... well ... I guess we'll see how it goes, won't we?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","Ah, the eternal optimism of the eternal lackey. Most encouraging."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_01","That ghastly thing is alive ... Its thoughts are bent on us ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_02","It knows we're here, that thing. It hates us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_03","That ... thing ... is aware. It reasons ... at least as much as you lot do."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_04","There is a presence here ... old ... malign ... endless ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_05","You see it, don't you? The creature in the wall?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_06","That creature ... We see only a fraction of its true form."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_07","Be glad that beast is trapped in the wall. Be glad it can't reach us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_08","The daemonic swirls close about this place ... Worse things may yet emerge ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_09","I cannot ... [Gasp] ... The pressure ... in my mind ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_10","That thing mustn't notice me ... It mustn't!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_01","Repulsive ... Truly repulsive ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_02","That is a special kind of horrible ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_03","I see the wall between the Immaterium and realspace is growing thin ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_04","It's ugly, yes. But so are many things a blunt might never see."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_05","These growths presage something terrible."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_06","See that? And the infestation has barely begun."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_07","This infestation is only the beginning. This world is doomed."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_08","Atoma is benighted. The proof is all around us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_09","If you cannot imagine more repulsive sights, fear not - you will surely see them soon."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_10","These are not growths, but extrusions into our world from a seething, pustulent Hel."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_01","I can feel ... something watching that shrine ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_02","Vile energies swirl about that shrine ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_03","A presence lingers near that shrine ... We should keep moving!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_04","Stay away from that shrine!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_05","No! ... The voices ... The voices ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_06","Get out of my mind!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_07","That shrine seethes with ... something ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_08","I feel a dark and suffocating presence ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_09","Do you not feel it? Something is watching us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_10","A shrine, laden with dark forebodings ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","The air is revolting down here, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","Oh good. Sentient scenery. Sentient and toxic scenery. [Sigh]"
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","Yes ... I can feel something crawling around my mind. It's ... horrible."
"loc_psyker_female_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","However bad it smells, its thoughts feel worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_01","We're being cut to pieces!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_02","I'm getting shot!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_03","Should we shoot back?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_04","Too much fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_05","They have overwhelming fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_06","By the Five Rusting Spires, I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_07","The heretics have me pinned!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_08","That's right, everyone shoot at the psyker!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_09","I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__pinned_by_enemies_10","Would you mind? I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_ogryn_01","Farewell, Brute. You were tolerable."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_ogryn_02","A shame about the Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_ogryn_03","I will miss the Brute ... even if the enemy did not."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_ogryn_04","We'll need a new Ogryn now, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_ogryn_05","Ah. We seem to be short one Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_psyker_01","My Sibling deserved better!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_psyker_02","Alas for my Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_psyker_03","At least my Sibling is now free!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_psyker_04","My Sibling has the only freedom my kind can know."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_psyker_05","Farewell, Sibling. Rest easy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_veteran_01","I see the Veteran's dead."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_veteran_02","Not much of a soldier after all ..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_veteran_03","Veteran's dead? Well, training can only carry you so far."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_veteran_04","Roughneck's dead? Well, live by the lasgun, die in the darkness."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_veteran_05","Oh. The Veteran's dead."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_zealot_01","Farewell, Fanatic. A sad loss."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_zealot_02","We seem to have lost a Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_zealot_03","Well, it's going to be quieter now."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_zealot_04","Did the Zealot just die?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_death_zealot_05","No more Zealot. Oh."
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_01","You're hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_02","Cretin! You're hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_03","You keep hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_04","That's armour, cretin!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_05","Stop hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_08","I wish I could target weak points like you…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_09","Aim for the weak point!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_10","Aim where it's weak, simpleton!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__power_circumstance_start_b_01","Nothing works on this wretched world ... "
"loc_psyker_female_a__power_circumstance_start_b_02","And there I was thinking the place couldn't look more miserable. Wrong again!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__power_circumstance_start_b_03","Another example of the Imperium's peerless efficiency, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__power_circumstance_start_b_04","Well, at least I probably won't see the thing that kills me."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_combat_01","Hah."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_combat_02","Not so easy to kill, am I?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_combat_03","Did that hurt?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_combat_04","How embarrassing for you."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_combat_05","Oh… I'm still alive."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_end_event_conversation_b_01","Yes, yes. Very heroic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_firefight_conversation_b_01","Panic and adrenaline, that's all."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_01","I am not dying in this revolting place…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_02","Oh, aren't you repulsive?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_03","Do we really have to fight? Go away."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_04","At last… a way out of this slime…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_05","All these alarms are giving me a headache…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_06","Traitors? This is getting worse."
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_07","Sounds like someone is having a very bad day. Still, every cloud has a diamantine lining…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_09","This ship is swarming with unattractive cretins… I should try another deck. Maybe that elevator still works?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__prologue_monologue_10","Why does this feel like a mistake?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_b_01","Are you talking to yourself again? It's starting to become ... unsettling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_d_01","Oh for--"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_macro_b_01","It's very simple: we are here to kill, and probably die."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_macro_d_01","Experience has taught me it is better to operate at a macro level. It brings clarity."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_purpose_c_01","True purpose comes from within, not from a red-faced man bellowing angrily all the time."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_quibble_a_01","Well, this is civilised. I mean, relatively speaking. There's not a blunt in sight."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_quibble_d_01","Don't quibble. It's beneath our kind."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_small_brain_b_01","It's the smaller brains, you see. If they perceived a fraction of what we behold, they'd all go mad."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_trusted_c_01","Yes, trust is relative. It may be that we are not elevated to the same level as the Blunts, but that they are reduced to ours."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_value_b_01","I'm weary of forever proving my value to people who don't care."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_weaponry_a_01","I must confess, it is nice to have access to all of this weaponry. To hold such power in one's hand ... it's delightful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_weaponry_d_01","And who says that? Those without power, hmmm? Jealousy is a terrible thing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_worse_a_01","Remember Siblings: it could always be worse!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_worse_d_01","It's merely a simple statement of fact: it can always be worse. And probably will be."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_01","Bravo, Brute! More!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_02","I must remember not to upset the Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_03","The Brute triumphs!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_04","The Ogryn's putting us all to shame."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_05","Well done, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","You've a knack for this, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_02","Well done, Sibling. That's the way."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_03","Don't strain yourself, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_04","You've been practising, haven't you Sibling?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_05","Sibling! Don't get carried away!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_01","Well, this is their job…"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_02","I've seen worse, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_03","You have a brutish efficiency, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_04","A Veteran should have a knack for killing."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_05","I think they upset the Veteran."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_01","Not just a Fanatic. Also a maniac."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_02","Bloodlust isn't as attractive as you might think, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_03","Even a blunt instrument has its place, eh Zealot?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_04","Messy, Zealot. Very Messy."
"loc_psyker_female_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_05","That looks exhausting, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_01","Killed it!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_02","Killed it!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_03","It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_04","It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_05","Gone!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_06","Gone!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_07","Hush! It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_08","Hush! It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_09","Settle down, it's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_10","Settle down, it's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__ranged_gameplay_04_01","You were very clear."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_carnival_a_01","These streets have the air of pleasures thwarted and indulged. Delightful."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_carnival_a_02","Another less-than-charming locale. However do we find them?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_carnival_a_03","Oh, I do like a change of scenery ... though I'm sure this place will be draped in Moebians ... just like the rest."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_habculum_01","Can you imagine living in such a place? Pfah."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_habculum_02","Ah, the Sector Habculum. All very civilised ... so long as you comply."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_habculum_03","Just when I thought this place couldn't get any bleaker..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_mechanicus_01","A death trap! How many thousands perish to keep its gears turning?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_mechanicus_02","This facility is a death trap. There are more ways to die on Atoma than at a heretic's hands."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_mechanicus_03","Another cult, another symbol. Although I concede the mechanicus has a certain style..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_periferus_01","This is a frontier. Fascism within, anarchy without. No place for honest souls. Or for us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_periferus_02","This place hasn't seen imperial rule in generations. A place apart, simply teeming … with disobedience."
"loc_psyker_female_a__region_periferus_03","The Imperium obliges citizens to live in filth like this and wonders why heresies arise?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_01","I'm out of ammunition!"

"loc_psyker_female_a__repeated_psykinetic_head_pop_a_04","Oops! Sorry!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__repeated_psykinetic_head_pop_a_05","Such a tiny vessel. Such tiny thoughts!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_01","Pray harder, Fanatic. Maybe it'll heal?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_02","Isn't suffering good for the soul, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_03","Perhaps the God-Emperor is testing you, Zealot?"

"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_critical_health_01","Then heal cretin, and stop bothering us."
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_critical_health_02","Do you always complain this much?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_critical_health_03","It's 'me, me, me' with you, isn't it?"

"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_veteran_03","I must have slipped."

"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_05","What happened to you?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_06","The Ogryn got careless!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_07","That could have gone better, eh Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_08","So much for physical might."
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_09","Strength is nothing without a mind to guide it."
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_10","Brute force doesn't solve everything, then?"

"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_ogryn_09","Large target, more fire. It's simple."
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_ogryn_10","Yes, well. Try not to get hit."
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_psyker_01","You're letting the side down, Sibling!"

"loc_psyker_female_a__surrounded_response_01","Do we not have grenades?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__surrounded_response_02","We need a defensible point!"

"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_dust_02","You know, I suspect these ruins might be an improvement on whatever was here before."
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_dust_03","Remarkable, isn't it? Just when you think this place can't become any more decrepit, it proves you wrong..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_tank_foundry_01","So this is where they treat humans as objects on this world. How bleak and unsurprising..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_tank_foundry_02","See how they value the machines more than the workers? A proud tradition in the Imperium."
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_tank_foundry_03","Ah yes. How splendid, the mechanisation of humanity. Don't you feel proud?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_throneside_01","The rot's here already, it would be idiotic to stay. So I assume that's exactly what we're going to do?"
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_throneside_02","I see no benefit in remaining here. It's clearly already lost..."
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_throneside_03","The decay's already set in here. It's as futile to try save this place as it is the rest of the Imperium..."

"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_transit_02","The Imperium failed the people who lived in this place."
"loc_psyker_female_a__zone_transit_03","Bleak? Depressing? Almost an improvement by Atoma's standards..."

"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_important_rule_d_01","True. I wouldn't like that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_imposing_a_01","People keep telling me I'm not asleep, Sibling. It's very disconcerting."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_imposing_c_01","That's right. I'm asleep, they're all part of my dream. I should make them understand. "
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_impressive_b_01","I'm sure it's a very impressive number. After all, you're very impressive."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_impressive_d_01","You might be onto something there, Sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_kill_them_b_01","Kill who first?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_kill_them_d_01","Stands to reason, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lifting_spirits_b_01","I don't know. Is it warm and fuzzy, or cold and full of teeth."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lifting_spirits_d_01","Ah, so you've been drinking again. I am very disappointed."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_a_01","Didn't we just come through here?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_c_01","So you're lost too?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_two_a_01","Are you never afraid of getting lost?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_two_c_01","Really? That's very impressive."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loud_a_01","You are very loud, Sweet Brute. "
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loud_c_01","This isn't a competition, you know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_music_a_01","Can you hear any music, Sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_music_c_01","Oh ... Only, I keep hearing music. It comes and goes, and seems to get louder whenever we're under attack. It's very concerning."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_noise_b_01","I shall, Sweet Brute ... at least when it's not too dark to see."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_noise_d_01","Oh, you are good."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reading_the_past_a_01","You keep staring at our surroundings. What are you looking for?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reading_the_past_c_01","That does sound interesting. Will you teach me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_salvation_b_01","Is he a nice fella, this Salvation?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_salvation_d_01","Oh, that is nice. Only, I think he's probably overtaken us by now. We have been killing rather a lot of people."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_screaming_b_01","Oh? That's very kind. I don't want me getting hurt either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_screaming_d_01","That's fair. I don't like my screaming either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_souvenir_b_01","Oh, I do hope so. They are all very bad people. They deserve it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_souvenir_d_01","A what?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_souvenir_f_01","Oh, souvenir? Or an actual ear?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stories_a_01","Thank you for telling me that story aboard the valkyrie, Fanatic. It was very moving."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stories_c_01","I particulary liked the speeder chase in the middle."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stories_c_02","The part where the hero killed his own daughter by mistake. Tragic!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stories_c_03","I don't think having the Ork Warlord there really added something. He feels like he was introduced afterwards."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stories_c_04","It was a very clever deconstruction of post-Maledictum narrative, and a keen insight into the tendency towards revisionism when applying the propaganda of the present to the apocrypha of the past."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stories_e_01","Oh. I must have gotten bored and started making things up. I do that sometimes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_strongest_a_01","Tell me, sweet Brute ... How did you get so strong?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_strongest_c_01","One of the other Ogryns said he was stronger."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_strongest_e_01","Oh dear. I didn't mean to cause any trouble."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sweet_a_01","You're always looking out for me, Sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sweet_c_01","Oh very well. How do you feel about ""adorable""? I could call you that instead."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_symbiosis_b_01","I suppose that's only natural. After all, I did dream all this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_symbiosis_d_01","How nice. I don't think I've been one of those before. "
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_talk_down_a_01","I do like you. You don't talk down to me like the others."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_talk_down_c_01","That's not what I meant, but thank you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_thoughts_b_01","Depends on the thoughts. I like yours. They're warm and round."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_thoughts_d_01","They're warm too. But hotter. And spiky. And full of ... I don't want to talk about it any more."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_twin_b_01","I don't know. Could it mean you've taken a sharp knock to the head?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_twin_d_01","You see mysteries everywhere. That's your trouble."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_two_evils_b_01","So ... You want me to fight by your side? I thought you hated me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_two_evils_d_01","Oh, so I'm the lesser of two evils? I don't think I care for that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vision_ruins_b_01","You know, I think I saw the same thing. You were there with me, gazing in wonder at our surroundings. Then someone shot you, and you died."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vision_ruins_d_01","Oh, don't worry. I killed them for you. If only I could remember their face. I know it was someone you trusted."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_b_01","But what about the voices? "
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_d_01","And if they all sound like me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_weep_a_01","Have you learned much about the history of this place, Sibling?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_weep_c_01","How do you mean?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_weep_e_01","Maybe they should. The streets could do with a good clean."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_sanity_a_01","Sometimes ... in the quiet moments ... I have the horrible feeling that I might not be sane."
"loc_psyker_female_b__bonding_conversation_sanity_c_01","So you think I'm worrying over nothing? I'm not mad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__calling_for_help_01","No!"

"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_hunted_b_01","Oh, it's not so bad. It gets me running about more. I need the exercise."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_hunted_b_02","Hush, sweet Brute. I'm sure it will all work out for the best."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_gas_b_01","My Beloved says it'll be fine if you stay close to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_gas_b_02","I'm sure it'll all work out. Everything does, right up until the point you die."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_a_01","I can't see much. Is that going to be a problem?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_a_02","No Beloved, I can't see much of anything."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_a_01","I've been hunted before. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_a_02","Yes Beloved. Hunted again. It's not fair."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_b_01","I wish you hadn't said that. I'm getting some terrible flashbacks."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_b_02","Why did you have to remind me? I was trying to forget."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_b_01","You see, I thought that, but I was afraid you'd all laugh at me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_b_02","Even I know that! Does that mean I'm getting better at this?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_b_01","Oh, those poor dogs. Are you sure there isn't another way?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_b_02","I suppose it's necessary. I don't want to be eaten."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_b_01","Yes ... my dream has grown a little indistinct."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_b_02","I think it's sort of beautiful. Like an unformed memory ... or a fading emotion."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_b_01","Speaking as the sort you used to hunt, I'm cheering for the Hounds."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_b_02","Yes Beloved, you do have an amusing sense of justice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_gas_b_01","You don't sound very sure. Are you worried?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_gas_b_02","Oh, I'm sure I wouldn't dream something toxic ... I mean, apart from all those other things."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_06_b_01","Why thank you, Sweet Brute. I shall bear that in mind."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_07_b_01","That will make a terrible mess. How thrilling."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_09_b_01","Oh, I'm never scared. I generally proceed directly to ""terrified""."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_13_b_01","I know ... It tingles, doesn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_14_b_01","There's no need to pretend, you know. I won't think less of you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_01_b_01","I like medals. And trophies. Eyeballs, fingers ... afterimages of terror ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_04_b_01","Oh, I don't know. No ... No ... You're right. It'll all have to go."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_07_b_01","Oh, I never do. Somehow I always seem to be here anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_12_b_01","But this is fun, Sweet Brute. Isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_16_b_01","No one's contesting that. I mean ... look at me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_17_b_01","So you keep saying. It's not like anyone's arguing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_01_b_01","My Beloved knows the quickest way to a Brute's heart..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_04_b_01","I try not to think about what my mortal shell endures."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_07_b_01","My Beloved told me what's in our rations. You can have mine."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_12_b_01","Sweet Brute... I think there is a thirst you can never quench. So sad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_16_b_01","It's probably a whole colony. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_17_b_01","That's really not what my Beloved meant. But you wouldn't understand."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_20_b_01","My Beloved says the true weapon is within us. Or maybe he only meant me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_02_b_01","So was I! At least, that's what my Beloved tells me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_05_b_01","Oh, I don't mind. I'm always useful."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_10_b_01","Mine too! I suppose that's why it's a dream, not a nightmare."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_b_01","I'm still not sure I like the killing. But it's certainly colourful."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_20_b_01","Oh yes. They're all treacle-y, and covered with some kind of ... I want to say ""slime""?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_01_a_01","Oh, I really don't like this ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_02_a_01","Are we lost? I feel like we're lost."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_02_b_01","You might be lost. I know exactly where I am."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_03_a_01","My dream really is a miserable place, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_04_a_01","How much longer is this going to take?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_05_a_01","I do hope you'll protect me during the next attack."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_05_b_01","I'll certainly try, Sibling. Perhaps you should stay close to me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_06_a_01","No, Beloved. Something about this isn't right."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_a_01","Beloved? I don't think I like this dream very much."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_08_a_01","You are there, aren't you Beloved? It's ever so hard to hear your voice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_09_a_01","Beloved? You'll have to speak up. I can't hear you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_10_a_01","Everything's fallen into decay. Then again, everything always does."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_10_b_01","Rotting, rotting, rotting. It's the fate that awaits us all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_a_01","I think I'd like to wake up now ... Oh, if only it were that easy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_b_01","I'd rather stay sleeping, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_12_a_01","I never knew a dream could smell so bad, or sound so loud."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_13_a_01","Oh, I do enjoy your company. I wish you were all real."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_14_a_01","A medicognisant once told me I was delusional, can you believe that? So I made him go away."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_15_a_01","My dream is better with heretics to shoot. It's ... soothing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_16_a_01","It's the waiting I don't like. Knowing they're out there ... Watching me ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_17_a_01","People keep telling me I'm creepy. You don't think I'm creepy, do you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_18_a_01","Violence can be so beautiful. I think we should make some more."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_19_a_01","Murder can be such fun! I wish I'd known earlier."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_20_a_01","If nothing else, death and destruction make for an entertaining dream ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_20_b_01","But it gives me nightmares. How does one get nightmares in a dream? That's worrying."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_02_b_01","Sibling, I do see it as you do. We're the same, you and I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_05_b_01","Who can our kind rely on, sibling, if not each other?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_10_b_01","Sweet sibling... If it's any consolation, My Beloved is very sorry."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_b_01","No, but I can just suck it directly out of their minds. Almost as good."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_20_b_01","I like to steer clear of Enforcers. Force of habit."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_b_01","Don't worry about it. I don't really aim, and I'm still enjoying myself!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_b_01","That is good news. And bad news. Maybe stick to the good news in future?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_10_b_01","Humanity is destined to destroy itself. I don't like to think about it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_11_b_01","I'm doing my best, thank you very much!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_18_b_01","I promise not to be parted from it! At least, not while I have my strength!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_20_b_01","I thought it was gratuitously unfair odds that won wars? That and ruthlessness."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","Yes, I'm certain I don't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_b_01","I've certainly got some ideas if you don't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_10_b_01","Oh, I'm sure there'll be another opportunity ... if we survive."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_11_b_01","Most of them aren't even lurking. They're running, screaming, dying ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_18_b_01","I'll certainly try, but I do find it all a bit barbaric."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_20_b_01","Oh yes. I mean ... We certainly don't have the numbers, so something must be in our favour."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_b_01","I'll have you know I'm perfectly trustworthy. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_b_01","I do hope you're not talking about me ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_10_b_01","You seem agitated, Roughneck. Have you been getting enough sleep?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_11_b_01","Oh, you do have a way with words, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_18_b_01","Just so long as they're not, you know, haunting us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_20_b_01","Yes, Beloved, they are very driven aren't they?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_02_b_01","It's not the darkness I mind, but the terrible things lurking within. They have teeth."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_05_b_01","But I don't want to be a hammer."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_11_b_01","That's the best kind of promise! One that no one can prove you didn't fulfil!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_15_b_01","Yes, my Beloved is very cross with some of them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_18_b_01","That doesn't sound at all fair."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_20_b_01","Oh, indeed. If they reject my Beloved there's no saving them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_02_b_01","Oh, it's only a dream. You can't really die here. Well, I can't anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_05_b_01","The good part is, you'll never know either way. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_11_b_01","That does sound nice. For us, I mean. Not for them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_15_b_01","Are you sure? I mean, you don't look particularly well-rewarded."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_18_b_01","Then you must be the cleanest soul on all Atoma. That's nice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_20_b_01","Well then ... after you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_02_b_01","My Beloved appreciates the sentiment, but he says the guns help too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_04_b_01","Are you sure? My Beloved thinks my greatest weapon is the fathomless Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_10_b_01","Oh dear... I just had a look, and I'm afraid you have quite a way to go."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_14_b_01","My Beloved says you're going the wrong way."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_17_b_01","That depends on your point of view."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_19_b_01","My Beloved really isn't so keen on these vulgar displays, you know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Oh Beloved, have you forsaken me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_02","I'd like to wake up now, I think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_03","I'm sure I've done all this before."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Is my dream repeating itself? I can't tell any longer."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_05","I sense hatred out in the darkness."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_06","There is a great shadow descending upon Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_07","I do hope this ends well."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_08","Morrow will be cross if we fail, so we'd better not."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_09","I'm starting to enjoy this ... I think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_one_liner_10","There is no lasting victory to be had on Atoma. What a shame."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","Sweet Brute, it means you are special!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","It means that when I dreamt you, I made you very special."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","Oh ... I was supposed to be aiming?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","I don't worry about things like that. My Beloved handles it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","That sounds unfortunate. Is there nothing to be done?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","My Beloved says you should aim more and shoot less."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Oh ... I need ammunition too ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Did you just take all the ammunition again?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","My Beloved says you should share the ammunition."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","I didn't mean to. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Oh. I'm afraid I wasn't paying attention."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Might I suggest deep, calming breaths? Or murder. Murder works too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","Let it out, Fanatic. You'll feel better."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","There's always something horrible up ahead, isn't there?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","I don't know what else you expected. We are steeped in darkness."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","That seems drastic. At least, I think so."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","But you wouldn't be ""you"" any longer. And I like ""you""."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Don't worry, sweet Brute. It won't be long."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","You remember that talk we had about patience, hmm?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","That doesn't seem right, sweet Brute. I mean ... look at you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","You don't need to pretend, you know. That looks like it hurts."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Oh, I'm sure it'll get worse. This dream is very strange."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Hush, sweet Brute. Enjoy the moment. It won't last."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","When your hobby becomes your duty, you never work a day in your life..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","Glad you're having fun, but could you ask them to keep the screaming down?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","I can dream it warmer if you like? ... Though it's plenty warm already."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","I thought it was warm. In fact it's making me sleepy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_a_01","You know, I think I'm getting the hang of this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_a_02","Companions? I feel like I'm finally contributing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_a_03","I'm definitely getting better at this whole ""murdering"" thing, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","My Beloved says he's very impressed. So am I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","I wish I had your confidence."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","They dwell in darkness. They're infected by it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","You're asking me to pick a side? My Beloved thinks that's sweet."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_a_01","I don't like the quiet. The dead scream all the louder."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_a_02","So many plaintive, dead voices. I wish they'd all be quiet!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_a_03","Will someone tell the dead to stop pestering me? I'm trying to think!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","My Beloved says death isn't so bad, if you can stand the pain."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","When I die, I go the light of My Beloved. You, on the other hand..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","I know. I think it sounds pretty. I like pretty things."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Maybe we should make friends with them? I'd like that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","You've told this story before, sweet Brute. Or... Did I dream of it tomorrow?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","I'm glad you've found something to aspire to, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","Don't worry, I'm sure my Beloved will save you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","So you are afraid of something, Fanatic? Well, well."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","I don't think that's a very good idea."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","I'm not sure you can escape my dream. It'd be cheating."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","My Beloved says that there are many calls on the Imperium's martial purse. Whatever that means."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","I suppose I could try dreaming some more warriors up for you, but it might not work."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","I am trying my best, you know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","I'm not sure I'm cut out for this life."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","I like them, Sibling. They have ... charm."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Explosions give me a headache."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","My Beloved has seen Hel. He says we really don't want to go there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","My Beloved has held back the tide for so long. He's so very tired."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_a_01","What if I'm not dreaming? Or that I'm the one being dreamt of?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_a_02","Oh ... I had a terrible thought. What if I'm the dream, not the dreamer?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_a_03","Companions ... I am dreaming this aren't I? It's not one of you dreaming me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","That's right! I knew you'd get it eventually!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Don't worry, Sibling. I won't dream anything unpleasant for you. Well, maybe."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","I'm afraid my dream is strictly teetotal. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","What a curious person you are, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","My Beloved is splendid, isn't he?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","You hear that, Beloved? He's talking about you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","I haven't decided yet. I prefer to let the dream take me where it will."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","I don't believe in absolutes ... Oh, that was an absolute wasn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","Evil spreads faster than kindness. I've never understood why."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Most of our foes are just seeking hope. Desperation blinds them to the truth."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_a_01","My Beloved says this war will never end. It will only change form."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_a_02","There is no respite in this war. There is only strife everlasting."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_a_03","I have dreamed of endless war. There is no escaping it. Sorry!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","We are all corpses in the making."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Death waits for us all. And he's very impatient."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","I'm not expendable, thank you. You can't have my dream without me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","The galaxy will not miss any of us. It's a simple truth, I'm afraid."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Yes, feet are always a problem."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Well, your toes are rather large."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","You are not burning down my dream!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Fire is nothing but aggressive entropy. There's nothing magnificent about it!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","It's all right, sweet Brute. Just stay close to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Oh, we all forget things sometimes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_a_01","Just think. What we see is mirrored across a thousand, thousand worlds. So much suffering. [Laugh]"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_a_02","The Imperium began in blood. It is sustained by blood. And it will drown in blood. [Laugh]"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_a_03","There is no victory in this war, just a feast of misery, feeding on itself. [Laugh]"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","That's not very funny."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","[Laugh] I know. It's horrible!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Oh, I like you too. But then I dreamed you up, so I should, shouldn't I?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","Oh, how nice. So we are friends?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Oh Brute, there are things down here you really shouldn't eat..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Sometimes I think you're just my dream, but would I really dream of... that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","They are pitiable, aren't they? Screaming souls trapped in rotting bodies."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","I don't like them either. I don't think anyone does."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","I don't think you should be wasting that ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","I agree, Beloved. That was very wasteful."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","You should be more careful with our medicae supplies."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Sorry! Medicae is for real people. Not dreams."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","I saw it first. That's fair. That's how it works."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","Is there something wrong with my dream? Perhaps I should change it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","But you are home, sweet Brute. You belong here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","Actually, My Beloved thinks your songs are quite depressing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","I sing to him all the time… Just not out loud."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","You are very noisy. Can't you stop?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","No no no no no. I like it quiet."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","You are a monster, aren't you, sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Oh look! He's happy. Sort of."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Oh yes. I'd like that!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Of course, sweet brute! Lead on! I shall follow!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","I think I would have liked it here, before the dark came."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","My Beloved says it's hard to dream here, so far from the open sky."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_a_01","I feel so lonely. It's not as though any of you actually like me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_a_02","It's hard, you know, being the only real person in a dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_a_03","You do know that you're not real, don't you? I'm all alone."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","I don't know what you mean. You're part of my dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","No. I'm sorry. My dream. My rules."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","That sounds like an awful lot of work."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","I think there might be something wrong with you ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","My Beloved thinks I could be a saint. Sometimes I think he doesn't know me at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Messelina says she appreciates the thought, but would rather not have been put to the sword."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","I'm treated even worse ... I see how you all look at me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","My Beloved adores you, Sibling. Never fear!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","My Beloved says Tertium is without feeling ... because it's a thing, not a person."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Nothing last forever. Not even my Beloved ... but don't let him hear you say that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","I'm sure expertise counts for more than sheer size, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","I think you're doing very well with what you have."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","Oh dear, Beloved. He doesn't seem happy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","I don't like stairs, Brute. It means effort."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","It is true. My Beloved is rather happy with our progress."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","Some of us will be rewarded in the end, certainly."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","He says you're welcome."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","No thank you, I already spoke to him today."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","My Beloved says there isn't really time."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Just enjoy the quiet. I know I am."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Sometimes my dream is a little unruly. Perhaps it's that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","I don't know, and my Beloved refuses to answer."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","If I get hungry, I eat your thoughts."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","We'll all be combat rations one day."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Oh! Hello! Are you in my head? I wondered what tickled."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","Prying isn't very polite. You'll upset my Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Oh, don't take on so. I like you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","Intelligence is overrated. That's what my parents always told me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","I'd like that. I think I'd like that, anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","I do hope you are right. Everything looks so miserable right now."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","I'm already asleep, remember? This is all a dream. My dream. Not yours."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","Ah, but without industry, do we even have purpose? And if we've no purpose, do we exist?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","I don't really know any songs. Or rhymes. Now I'm sad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Singing? No. We don't have any of that in my dream. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Oh dear. I don't think it's wise to rest here, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","I'm sleepy too. No. Wait. I'm asleep. It's not the same thing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Their distance is psychosis, you see. Unable to connect with others, they kill."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Their laser sights are very pretty. I think I'd like one."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","You're very undignified, did you know that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Beloved, would you mind soothing our shouty friend? He's getting on my nerves."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","I can be sneaky, if you'd like?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","I fear we haven't the training for that. Or any training at all, in my case."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","It is a bit of an eye opener, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","It's just sweat rinsing away our dead flesh. I don't what the problem is."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","That sounds splendid, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","You are sure that's a good idea, sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","My Beloved would agree, if it weren't for all the heretics."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","In my dreams, Tertium is a rotting carcass, crawling with maggots."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_a_01","Don't you think we'd achieve more if we worked together? I mean, properly."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_a_02","We'd do better to work as a team. You know ... support one another?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_a_03","We really should attempt to get on better. We might live longer."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","Oh yes. Let's be friends. I could use some friends."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","That's a good point. Survival is forged from common cause."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","I don't like them either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","They are lost. So lost they can't even see where they left the path."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","There is no justice in this life, only degrees of suffering."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","You'll forgive me if I don't find you wholly convincing?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","You do know none of this is real, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","Oh, is this a game? I like games. As long as I'm winning."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","Don't worry, Beloved, we'll always have each other..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","Oh, if only you'd seen what I've seen..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","No, Beloved, I don't think the Roughneck trusts anyone."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","I sense you'll have real traitors to worry about quite soon..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realise this was a test."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","I don't have to be a proper soldier. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","That's very inspiring. At least ... I'm very inspired."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","Oh yes! ... Wait, what are we doing?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","My weapons are dirty because everything is dirty here. It's horrible."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","I was going to clean them, but then I realised I didn't want to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","I don't think My Beloved is in a forgiving mood today. Best not test him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","I hold no secrets from My Beloved. From you, however…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Of course my Beloved is here. He always is."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","Isn't that nice, Beloved? Other people can see you too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","You don't look that wounded!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","You do look a little off-colour. Almost human, in fact."
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_01","You shouldn't wander off…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_02","Why are you leaving?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_03","Where are you going?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_04","You really should stay with us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_05","Don't leave. You might get hurt."
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_06","Beloved, how do I make them stay nearby?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_07","No, Beloved, I don't think it's a good idea for them to wander."
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_08","Stay with us!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_09","Please stay here!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__come_back_to_squad_10","My dream ends badly for you if you wander off."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","I'm sure I dreamed up other warriors to protect this world. I wish they were here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","My Beloved says you're not being truthful. He's very disappointed in you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","My Beloved keeps whispering of the 'Cicatrix Maledictum', but never explains (he's like that sometimes). What is it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Would you mind saying that again?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","My Beloved's curious... He wants to know if we've put my dream right yet."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","This city's all so vast and empty. It's swallowed us up. We might never again see the sky..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","When are we going to the other hive city? The bad one that everyone pretends is lost?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","I think it's trying to be friendly!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","Beloved! It won't die!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","My Beloved says we should attack from behind!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Hit it from behind, that's what my Beloved says!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","Oh, you do take the fun out of things."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Look, whose dream is this anyway?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","Do you find Explicator Zola terrifying? Or is it just me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Explicator Zola seems nice ... and then she doesn't. It's very strange."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","My Beloved says she is more loyal to us than she seems."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She is conflicted about Atoma. Love and hate, all tangled up."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","She's strange ... but everything in my dream is strange."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","I hope she stays friendly ... I would hate for anything bad to happen to her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","My Beloved says the explicator once called Atoma her home."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","The explicator once lived on Atoma. I'm sure of it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Of course I already knew that. It is my dream, after all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Oh ... I'd keep that close. I don't think she likes being the subject of gossip."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","My Beloved said the same, but I didn't believe him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Does that mean you're going to be friends?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","She's so lucky to have found it!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","Isn't she lucky to have found something so valuable? I'm sure it's genuine. Truly."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","She's very loud, isn't she? The pilot. Is she ... all right?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I like the pilot. She's not so serious as the others."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I hear her soul singing sometimes ... when it's not weeping."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","She's so strange. Happy and sad, all at once."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","No, Beloved. I won't look at her thoughts. I'll get in trouble."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Oh ... Can we walk to the next mission?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_01","Fellows! You'll never believe what I beheld earlier today!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_02","You'll never guess what I saw!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_03","I want to tell you something, but you'll never believe it!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_04","I saw something incredible! My Beloved says you'll not believe me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","Ooh! Oh! How many guesses do I get?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Was it a Thamaxian prism stallion?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_01","Our esteemed pilot physically remonstrated with the quartermaster. Successfully."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_02","Fisticuffs! Pilot-lady against the quartermaster. She won."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_03","The quartermaster upset Pilot-lady, so she upset him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_04","Pilot-lady laid out the quartermaster. With her bare hands!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","Really? I keep wanting to do that, but Rannick says I mustn't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Is she really telling the truth, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_01","It's true, I swear. One punch. Smack. Drop."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_02","He hit the floor so hard."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_03","... and then she kicked him in the head! Something went crunch."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_04","I wonder if she'll teach me how it's done?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","Have I done something to offend you? I'm sure I didn't mean to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","Oh. You look cheerful. I do hope it's nothing embarrassing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Foolish, foolish, Roughneck..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Some people never learn, do they?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","This isn't working! What do we do?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","Why won't it die? It needs to die!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Maybe you should hit it in the head?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Ooh! Ooh! Maybe if we shoot the Plague Ogryn in the head?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","That does sound fun."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","If only it'd stop moving around ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_01","The sergeant's soul hangs heavy. Old names echo around his thoughts."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_02","Whenever the sergeant's talking to us, he's thinking about others ... dead others."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_03","The sergeant's thoughts are thick with memories of the dead."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_04","Strange ... Even when the sergeant's talking to us, he's thinking about the dead."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","Yes ... I've observed this. A litany of names. Almost like a prayer."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","I think we remind him of old comrades ... Is that bad? I think it might be."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","Do you suppose we might cheer him up? No. That won't work, will it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","That's funny. His name's Morrow, but he lives in the past! It is funny, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","Does anyone else find the sergeant a bit ... unhappy?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","I don't like the way the sergeant regards me. I've seen that look before."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","He worries about what's happening on Atoma. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","My Beloved says he's worried about Atoma. He thinks we're delaying the inevitable."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Better keep that to yourself ... You wouldn't want him to hear it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","You're certain he can't hear us right now?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","That's a pretty name. What happened there?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","I don't think I know that one. Should I?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","I see ... So you think Morrow was working for the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","Morrow was there? He should be dead. Was he working for the Inquisitor, do you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","My Beloved says Morrow is much older than he seems."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow's body is in its prime, but his soul is old. Parchment-thin and translucent. It's ... ugly."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Maybe he's not human? Maybe none of us are? ... Oh."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","You never know ... He might not be human."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","I can ask my Beloved. He'll know what happened. He knows everything."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Maybe that's why he's so angry?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","The Tech-Priest ... she is a little strange, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","Does no one else find the Tech-Priest ... a little curious?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","There's a space in my dream where she should be ... but I can't see her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","Her thoughts are like the grinding of gears ... I wonder what would happen if I stopped them?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","If she does turn out to be evil ... I can always unmake her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","I'm almost certain she means well."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","I don't have to take part. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Oh ... Are you all right? Your aura's gone all funny ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","My Beloved says he agrees with you. He also says you should be nicer to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","Don't be foolish. This is my dream. Not his."
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Why do you talk that way, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","You do talk strangely, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__cover_me_01","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__cover_me_02","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__cover_me_04","I need cover!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__cover_me_05","Cover me… please?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__cover_me_06","I need cover fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_01","Oh… I'm bleeding…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_02","So… dizzy…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_03","Oh look… stars…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_04","Such strange colours…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_05","Everything hurts!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_06","Why does everything hurt?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_07","It hurts, Beloved!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_08","I need healing!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_09","I need medicae!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__critical_health_10","I think I need medicae…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_b__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_psyker_female_b__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","It's got me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Get off, beast!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","Shoo, mutt!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","Help!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_06","Get it off!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_07","Aaargh!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_08","Help! HELP!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","Leave me alone!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","Get it off me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_01","I can't get free!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_02","I'm trapped!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_03","Oh… I'm trapped."
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_04","Oh… I'm snared."
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_05","This is no good… I'm trapped."
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_06","Can't get free!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_07","Beloved… help me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_08","All trapped. No no no no no."
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_09","Free me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_10","Help! Free me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_01","Rager is dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_02","We killed the Rager!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_03","Rager's slain."
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_04","No more Rager!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_05","Rager? You've gone still."
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_06","Not so angry now…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_07","It's gone very still…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_08","Nice and quiet. That's better."
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_09","Yes Beloved. It was angry, wasn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_10","Its victims can rest now."
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_03_c_01","Oh, they do make a fuss, don't they Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_05_e_01","I don't like pain. Unless it belongs to someone else."
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_01","The Hound's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_02","Hound's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_03","We've killed the Hound!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_04","Yes… The Hound's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_05","The Hound's gone!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_06","Bad dog. Sit. Stay."

"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_03","We should bind our wounds. All of us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_04","A healer's station. How delightful!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_05","What a splendid healer's station!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_06","Oh. A healer's station."
"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_07","We can heal? Yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_08","Yes, Beloved, it's a healing station. Shush."
"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_09","A healer's station. Blessed be."
"loc_psyker_female_b__look_at_healthstation_10","Ooh. Balms and unguents."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_four_b_01","But I'm sure you're the most special, right, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","They call you the Alpha type. Stands to reason there should be others."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_four_c_01","It doesn't matter ... All Ogryns are lovely, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_four_c_02","My Beloved says you're all quibbling. Quibble. Quibble. Quibble."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_one_b_02","How can something so small be so dangerous?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_one_c_01","Ratlings are very good at hiding. There could be one here right now, and you'd never know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_one_c_02","Widely despised, yet always come up trumps. I think I like these ""Ratlings""."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_01","I think I feel most sorry for abhumans. Nobody likes them much."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_02","It's very unfair how abhumans are treated, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_03","I think it's sad how people look down on abhumans."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_04","Nobody likes abhumans much, do they? I never understood why."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_01","Everyone should be loved for who they are, no matter how monstrous or dangerous."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_02","There are some abhumans who no one ever talks about, and that's the saddest fate of all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","I think I'd like to see a Felinid, but they're very rare."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","My Beloved says Felinids are particularly beautiful. I'd like to see one very much."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_two_b_01","My Beloved says they do have souls. And so do lots of other creatures you don't like."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","You'd be surprised how small and shrivelled some souls are. I take a peek on occasion."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","I hope you get your wish, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","Oh, sweet Brute, you do find pleasure in the simplest things."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","My Beloved admires your enthusiasm, but says you should concentrate on the matter at hand."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","I wonder if the heretics have tanks? I hope they don't have Null Shields. Makes them less... squishy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","But Roughneck, there are such horrors to come. You wouldn't wish that on your friends, would you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","You have new friends now, Roughneck. At least, I hope we're friends. I'd be most upset if not."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","Steel-eyed, cold-blooded killers. I like them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","I don't think we need the Imperial Guard just yet, but I suppose it's never too late to panic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_01","I wonder why Imperial Guard Commissars are so... heartless."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_02","Have you ever met an Imperial Guard Commissar? They're so frightful!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_03","I've a lot in common with Imperial Guardsmen. I fear the Witch Hunters, and they fear the Commissars."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_04","My Beloved calls Imperial Guard Commissars a necessary evil. I wonder what he means."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Oh, but they do have very nice uniforms."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","If they were nicer to their soldiers, I'm sure they'd get better results."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Commissars have a hard childhood. Perhaps they're just misunderstood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Behind their black garb, they're just lost children who need a cuddle."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","I've never met a kind preacher. Quite strange, when you think about it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","My Beloved thinks that if we really must kill in his name, then it's best we win."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Sebastian Thor was a simple preacher, and just look what he became."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_four_b_01","Yes, that does seem likely."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_four_b_02","All this categorisation of ""killers"". We're all fighting in the mud. Why quibble?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_four_c_01","I wonder if her crew get nicer uniforms?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_four_c_02","I think pirates have to sing. And I don't like singing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_one_b_01","She feels shackled by duty and circumstance. So do I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_one_b_02","She's trapped by honour and old debts. Funny. She doesn't look the sort for that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Oh, I'm sure she'll cheer up ... Once the killing starts."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_one_c_02","She looks lonely. Lonely and proud."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_a_01","No one's indispensable, of course, but I think the shipmistress is close. She doesn't seem to like it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_a_02","Have you seen how Rannick defers to the shipmistress? She must be important."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_a_03","No one questions Shipmistress Brahms, did you notice? Such easy authority."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_a_04","My Beloved says that the shipmistress is deep in Grendyl's counsel."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_b_01","I think she might explode soon. Like a bomb. That will be colourful, won't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_b_02","I don't think I could handle that sort of pressure."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_c_01","Perhaps my Beloved will cheer her up. He's good at that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_three_c_02","Well, we can't all be cheery, can we?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_two_b_01","Oh ... I don't think the shipmistress would care to hear that. Maybe I'll tell her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_two_b_02","That's probably not a wise thing to say ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_two_c_01","I don't think I'd like that life. Sounds like it'd be full of detail and boredom."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_brahms_two_c_02","You do know a Rogue Trader's life is more piracy than negotiation, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_four_b_01","When they draw near, the colours of my dream become those of rot and ruin. All is contaminated."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_four_b_02","All things decay. All things rot, or rust, or die. The heretics seek only to hasten the process."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_four_c_01","In my dreams I've seen entire systems fall to plague. And with it comes madness."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_four_c_02","Sometimes I dream of a realm of a Million-and-One Plagues, from where all corruption stems..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_one_b_01","My Beloved doesn't dispute their godhood, just their goals."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_one_b_02","Maybe they are gods, but I wouldn't recommend giving them your soul."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_one_c_01","In my dream, there is a changeling lord, who tells My Beloved the galaxy is his. And always has been..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_one_c_02","The lords of the Empyrean are cunning. I don't think the heretics know they're falling till it's too late."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_a_01","The Empyrean is dream. It is madness. It is a Realm of Chaos, from where our nightmares flow."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_a_02","Some don't believe the Realm of Chaos exists. But it does."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_a_03","All of our enemies hail from the Realm of Chaos. It is a place of nightmare, where souls are damned."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_a_04","Sometimes, in my dream, I see the Realm of Chaos. Were it not for My Beloved, I might just drift towards the maddening laughter and never return."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_b_01","I can only glimpse it in my dream. To look into the Realm of Chaos is to risk madness, and clearly I'm quite sane."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_b_02","No one but My Beloved can gaze into the Realm of Chaos. The rest of us would just go mad, and you wouldn't want that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_c_01","We've all dreamed of the Impossible Fortress, with its twisting spires of formless crystal. Haven't we? Haven't we!?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Sometimes I dream of an Impossible Fortress, floating on a sea of pink fire. A voice calls to me, and it sounds so like My Beloved I almost follow..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_two_b_01","My Beloved still reels from the greatest of betrayals, and fears it could happen again."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_two_b_02","Oh, they're quite real. You should definitely be worried."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_two_c_01","It was all Horus's fault. My Beloved should really have paid him more attention. We all make mistakes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_chaos_two_c_02","What happened to Horus is My Beloved's greatest regret. But back then, he was only human..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_four_b_01","It's a place of suffering... evil... It's where the monsters live."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_four_b_02","A great wound in the Materium, from which the powers of Chaos flow freely."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_four_c_01","My Beloved says it was made by a god. But that can't be right. He's the only god, isn't he?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_four_c_02","I see a realm of madness and despair… skies weeping blood… ancient stars burning…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Daemons are always just one bad dream away..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_one_b_02","They can't be that far away, or I wouldn't be able to hear them whispering."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_one_c_01","Sometimes they make incursions in great number. I have dreamt it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_one_c_02","I have dreamt of daemonic incursions so vast, whole worlds are swept away..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_three_a_01","If a Daemon ever got past my defences, things would be bad for you. Very bad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_three_a_03","Do you think I'm strong enough to resist a Daemon? Zola said so, but I'm not so sure."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_three_a_04","Sometimes, in my dream, I can hear Daemons scratching at my mind. I hope they don't get in."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_three_b_01","I couldn't be possessed, if that's what you mean. It's already rather crowded in here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_three_b_02","My Beloved says nothing can get into my head while he's in there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_three_c_01","It was either this or the Soul-Binding... I wouldn't have minded being bound to My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_three_c_02","You all look frightened now. I hope it's not something I said."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_two_b_01","It was the Blackening. The horror still haunts my nightmares."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_two_b_02","I dreamed a dream of madness and terror. The dream never really ended."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_two_c_01","I think they blame psykers for the whole thing. I do hope they don't execute me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_daemons_two_c_02","I sense troubled times ahead for my kind. They'll need someone to blame."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","My Beloved is far too humble to call himself a god."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","What's that, Beloved? Dangerous talk? Oh, don't worry, the Brute's far too big to threaten."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","If you could gaze into the Empyrean, you'd see My Beloved's light. It's very comforting."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","My Beloved doesn't mind if you don't believe. His light is there to guide us no matter what."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","I can put in a word with My Beloved if you like."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","It's true that My Beloved has no more faithful warriors than the Adepta Sororitas."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","They do have the best songs though. ""We Bless the Sinner as He Burns"" is very catchy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I've also heard them called ""uncompromising""."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_01","My Beloved says there are worlds who know nothing of his light. That's why we have the Missionarus Galaxia."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_02","Pity all the Imperial Missionaries are off exploring. Could have done with a few here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_03","I wonder how many worlds the Missionarus Galaxia have reclaimed for My Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_04","There are some worlds that don't even realise they're at war, until the Missionaries find them. How silly!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","I mean, all human worlds belong to My Beloved, even if they don't know it yet."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","That's right, Beloved. Finders keepers. Missionaries are just reclaiming lost property."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","It's surprising how many Missionaries don't make it back. Apparently not everyone likes them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","I'd make a good Missionary. But My Beloved says he needs me here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","My Beloved says the Cardinals should listen more and chant less."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved, the Cardinals do have lovely hats."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","My Beloved rather likes the New Ecclesiarch. He's much better than the last one."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","My Beloved cannot count the number of Ecclesiarchs he's seen come and go."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","They're not so very different from you, Brute. Special, that's all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","Imagine if the Ordo Hereticus had been around when My Beloved was born..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","They say we're unclean. The very nerve!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_01","I know we do good work, Beloved, but must our order be so... cruel?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_02","I dreamt of bringing peace to the dispossessed. But we bring only cruelty and suffering."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_03","If I didn't know this was just a dream, I would say the Inquisition's methods were unusually cruel."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_04","Are all ordos of the Inquisition so... enthusiastic in their work? Or is it just us?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","You have a point, Sibling. They call it ""investigating"", but it's remarkably... stabby."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","This is just a dream, and nobody can really get hurt in a dream. Not really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Pain is an illusion of the senses, despair an illusion of the mind. So I'm told."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I know no one is truly innocent. But aren't some more guilty than others?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Did the Fanatic join the wrong Ordo by mistake?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Don't worry, Fanatic, I would never harm you... by accident."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","When you stare into the Warp, the Warp stares back into you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","I'm used to people being scared of me. My Beloved thinks they aren't scared enough."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","It's a war, Brute. The biggest war imaginable. And My Beloved isn't sure we're going to win."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","I think it's a nightmare. At least, I hope it is. I think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Are you sure? It all seems like such a long way away."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","No, Beloved. It doesn't seem like a good idea to me either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Cadia... the whole system at war. Billions dead. I... felt it. My Beloved felt it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","My Beloved tried everything. You have to believe him. He really tried..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","My Beloved was desperate. He says he might have made a mistake."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","It was foreseen. But that's the thing with prophecy. Nobody really believes it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_04","Since the Psychic Awakening I have more siblings than ever. Not all of them good."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","In my dream, I see others... Xenos... they all share our dream now. And our nightmare."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","We fear our own kind more than ever, but My Beloved says the Awakening has touched the Xenos, too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","Oh, I have ever such a bad feeling about all this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","No, Beloved. I don't think they really understand what's happening either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","The Nachmund Gauntlet is navigable, they say, but the dangers of that passage are great."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","My Beloved can barely see beyond the Great Rift, and what he does see fills him with dread."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","Time flows differently in the Dark Imperium. Who knows how long they've been fighting the nightmare?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Great danger comes from the Dark Imperium. I feel it scratching at the edge of my dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","I know! I never knew I could dream in such detail!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","It's splendid, isn't it? So many new friends!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","I don't want to get too attached to anyone. I think most of them are going to die."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","I don't really see people. Just corpses that aren't dead yet."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","It doesn't bother me. My Beloved knows everything, so I don't have to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","I enjoy a good mystery. It keeps me grounded."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","It'll all turn out for the best ... I hope."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","Oh, stop complaining. You're upsetting me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_01","My Beloved says that Grendyl is distracted by other matters."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_02","I don't think Grendyl is entirely focused on Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_03","Grendyl claims Atoma is important, so why isn't Grendyl here?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_04","Surely Grendyl should be on the Mourningstar with everyone else?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","The Inquisitor can't be everywhere ... I don't think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","My Beloved is omnipresent. Alas, the same isn't true for the rest of us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","Oh, it'll all work out, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","You shouldn't worry. I just haven't dreamed Grendyl in enough detail yet. I'll get around to it at some point."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","It doesn't matter if Grendyl believes in my Beloved, so long as my Beloved believes in Grendyl."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Are you looking for common ground? Someone's ambitious."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","As long as the Fanatic's happy, where's the harm?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","The Fanatic could use a friend ... but I'm not sure Grendyl's a good fit."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_four_b_01","I confess, I don't really listen when she speaks."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Her voice is so ... Grating. I prefer to ignore her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_four_c_01","I don't see that it matters. After all, I'm in control of all this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_four_c_02","My dream, my rules. You shall do as I say, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_one_b_01","Oh, she doesn't unsettle me. After all, I can always unmake her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_one_b_02","Oh, I think I'm still creepier ... This is a competition, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_one_c_01","My Beloved says he wears a mask whenever he talks to her. That's strange."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Oh, she loves my Beloved so she's probably all right."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_a_01","The Tech-Priest's mind is cluttered, but highly organised."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_a_02","I don't like looking in the Tech-Priest's head. Her thoughts make my eyes bleed."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_a_03","The Tech-Priest has very metallic thoughts. They taste like blood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_a_04","You all think in spirals and bright colours. The Tech-Priest is all hard edges and monochrome."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I don't think you're supposed to do that ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_b_02","You didn't ... pry? You'll get us both in trouble."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_c_01","Oh, it'll all be forgotten when I wake up. It always is."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Don't you dare drag me down with you!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Age doesn't matter. It's the ability to kill with impunity that counts."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_two_c_01","Oh! Imagine the sights she's seen. How nice!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hadron_two_c_02","My Beloved says that Tech-Priests believe flesh to be weak. Isn't that odd?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","Are you sure, Sweet Brute? She does seem to go through rather a lot of them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","I don't know about that. I hear such horrible rumours ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","You're not meant for that life, Sweet Brute. Stay here with me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Oh, don't go. Whoever will I kill things with?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","That's the purser, isn't it? Go on ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Oh dear. I hope I don't have to be scared of her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","My Beloved refuses to talk about her. That's very odd, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","I hear people who enter her stateroom don't tend to come out, whether they're invited or otherwise."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_01","My Beloved says the purser's prices are very high ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_02","My, the purser's certainly bold with her prices, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_03","The purser's prices are very high ... given everything is almost certainly stolen."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_04","I wish the purser wouldn't charge so much ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","She is rather forceful, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","My Beloved says she doesn't negotiate. Ever."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Oh well. You can't take it with you!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","Don't worry about it. There's no pockets in a shroud."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Oh, don't be so serious. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","You're forever clucking like a broody fenhawk. Cluck. Cluck. Cluck."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","She always has an aura of death around her. It's very strange."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","Her eyes aren't quite right. It's like staring into oblivion."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","They're the Highborns. They think themselves safe in their tower, but they aren't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Highborns, Brute. I don't think they've even noticed the nightmare below."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","It must be nice being above the clouds. I hear they even have windows."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","If I'd been born in a spire, my dream would be different, and I may never have met My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","I sense there's much worse in the deep hive... I hope we don't have to go there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","I sense darkness ahead. There is more to fear in Hive Tertium than mere gangs..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Perhaps the gangers are just misunderstood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Everyone needs a chance at redemption. But if they shoot at us, I will have to make their heads explode."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_01","Hive-cities make me nervous. So many souls... so many thoughts... so much pain..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_02","I tend to stay away from crowds. Bad things can happen when my senses are overwhelmed. Bringing me to a hive was a very bad idea..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_03","I really don't like hive-cities. So many people... I can't tell who's dreaming who."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_04","No, My Beloved, I'm sure they wouldn't live in a hive-city either, given the choice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Imagine never seeing the sky. Mind you, the pollution is so bad you can't even see it from outside."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","The lower down you go, the older it gets. There are places long forgotten. Dark places."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Sometimes I think I might be awake, because my dream couldn't possibly be this... depressing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Yes, beloved, I also think we'd be better off in the High Hive."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Must we really make a tour of some smelly old factories?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved. Apparently without Moebian steel, your tanks would be poorly protected."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","I expect when everyone's dead they'll just man the factories with servitors. Sad, really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","At least the servitors will still be here when everyone else is gone."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Yes, Beloved, I would toll the Bell of Lost Souls for our brave Brute, too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_four_b_02","My Beloved says many a charlatan has had the Bell of Lost Souls tolled for them, so why not us?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_four_c_01","The most extraordinary things turn up in the most unlikely places. That's how My Beloved found me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_four_c_02","I think I'd like to be remembered a hero. Will you make that happen, My Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Everyone thinks My Beloved lives there, but he doesn't. Not really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_one_b_02","My Beloved thinks we're all better off out here. Terra isn't what it was."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_one_c_01","My Beloved would love to show us around, but the others won't let him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_one_c_02","I'd hate to see My Beloved shackled to that Golden Throne. He's better off here, with me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_a_01","My Beloved has many regrets. He says the Imperial Tithe is a harsh necessity."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_a_02","Do you think Atoma will ever start paying the tithe again? I hope not. It seems unfair."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_a_03","I dreamed of a galaxy free of the Imperial Tithe. My Beloved enjoyed the dream very much."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_a_04","I dreamed last night of the Imperial Tithe. Of children torn from their home worlds. Pain..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_b_01","In My Beloved's defence, not all tithes are paid in souls."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_b_02","My Beloved would like it known that tithes guarantee protection for all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_c_01","I hear some worlds make a game of the tithe. Sounds like fun!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I think the meaning of the tithe has been lost in translation."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_two_b_01","My Beloved finds it all very tiring."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_two_b_02","My Beloved never intended to take things so far."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_two_c_01","So many souls destined for destruction. Sad, really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_imperium_two_c_02","This world isn't so bad, once you get used to the smell."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","No, Beloved, I wouldn't like to meet one. Not after last time."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","My Beloved says the problem with Assassins is that they don't really listen to him any more."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","My Beloved thinks we should speak no more of this. You never know who's listening..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Even acknowledging the existence of the Officio Assassinorum is a crime deserving assassination. So they say."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","My Beloved says it wouldn't work. The thing we need to destroy is buried deep... Very deep."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","It won't work. Not here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Every time a world dies, things get a bit quieter in My Beloved's head."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","My Beloved says we should stick to Plan A for now."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_01","I used to fear enforcers. Now we're in the Inquisition, we're above Imperial Law."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_02","Being above Imperial Law is fun. I rather like being in the Inquisition."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_03","No, Beloved, I didn't realise the Inquisition were above Imperial Law. I should have joined sooner."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_04","My Beloved says many in the Inquisition forget the burden of being above the law."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","My Beloved always intended the law to be applied equitably, but alas!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","I used to dream of fleeing oppression. Now in the dream I am the oppressor. How curious."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","If I make myself useful, I can't be prosecuted. My Beloved promised."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","They say the Lex Imperialis contains the word of my Beloved, but it doesn't sound like him at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved, no one loves their work quite as much as the Fanatic..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","My Beloved doesn't really want you to kill for him. He thinks perhaps you just enjoy it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","So much death... In my dream, My Beloved weeps."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","I don't know, Brute, but My Beloved says it's so noisy he can hardly hear himself think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","Eldritch power, Brute. And dreams. And souls."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","What's that, Beloved? You didn't build it... You found it? Oh dear..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","What's that, Beloved? Oh... Very well, I won't say anything if you don't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","My Beloved says Macharius was very brave... But not quite as selfless as he made out."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","What's that, My Beloved? [gasp] Scandalous! Do tell more..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","He fancied himself incorruptible... My Beloved believes that was not the case."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_01","My Beloved thinks we could learn much from past ages, were we to open our minds."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_02","Yes, Beloved, they close their minds to the past, and cannot dream of a brighter future."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_03","All this has happened before, and will happen again if we don't learn from past eras."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_04","We could learn much from eras past, but choose to close our minds to enlightenment."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Yes, Beloved. For all their faith, I think they'd just let you suffer all over again."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","Weren't their two Imperiums once? But only one of My Beloved, thankfully."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Every era is an Age of Battle. In my dreams I see fires rage from star to star, for all time..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","No, Beloved, there is little comfort or hope to be found in this dark era..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","Oh, you speak of Goge Vandire. My Beloved remembers him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","But it was so long ago, Beloved. Can't you just live and let live? Oh... No, I suppose you can't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Remember Sebastian Thor? They named him Master of the Warp. That was My Beloved's doing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Sebastian Thor put a stop to Vandire's reign... With a little help from My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_four_b_01","It's good to have someone you can trust ... or so I'm told."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_four_b_02","Loyalty and trust are very important. They provide contrast to the day to day."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_four_c_01","That may be, but he's a terrible bore."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_four_c_02","Grey and withered inside ... he's probably crawling with spiders, too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_one_b_01","You can't mean Lord Darius Melk. He's much too sophisticated for the likes of you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_one_b_02","My very good friend Lord Darius Melk wouldn't be mean to you. After all, you're so far beneath his notice ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_one_c_01","That said, he is a bit stuffy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_one_c_02","Oh, stop playing games. You find him unbearable too!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_a_01","That Melk fellow has all kinds of things hidden in his brain ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_a_02","Melk has lots of secrets. I can ... feel ... them crawling beneath his words."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_a_03","Melk's hiding something, you know. Lots of somethings."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_a_04","I know Melk's hiding something, but I don't know what."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_b_01","No one makes it through life wholly blameless, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_b_02","I'm sure it's nothing terrible. Probably."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_c_01","Perhaps his superiority is a shield. It keeps him from realising he's no better than us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_three_c_02","What a curious fellow. Why ever did I dream him like that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_two_b_01","Perhaps you should speak more like me? Everyone wants to, deep down."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_two_b_02","Oh, I do hope he expressed his concerns in kindly fashion."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_two_c_01","Cheer up, Fanatic. The words don't matter so long as you can be understood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_melk_two_c_02","I could teach you my secret language if you like. It has fifteen vowels."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_four_b_01","This has all the makings of a horrible story ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_four_b_02","I bet it tickles. Did the storyteller say if it tickled?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_four_c_01","People are always making things up about Morrow. It's not nice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_four_c_02","Yes, Morrow's brusque ... but you're not a sunbeam either!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_one_b_01","That seems unlikely ... even to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_one_b_02","I don't believe you. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_one_c_01","The past is an illusion. Only the present matters."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_one_c_02","The past is a broken mirror. Peer at it too long and you'll go mad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_a_01","I do find it curious that Morrow has such a strange past, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_a_02","Morrow's past is all tangled. It's very confusing, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_a_03","I don't know that I really understand Morrow's past. Don't you find it strange?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_a_04","Morrow's past is a tangle of threads. The truth is complicated, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Renown is a meandering river."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_b_02","Truth and lies, truth and lies, round and round and round and round."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_c_01","I just wish the sergeant major would smile more. He'd be less scary."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_three_c_02","At least we can all agree that Morrow has a splendid moustache, yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_two_b_01","That was a long time ago, wasn't it? I don't really do numbers."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_two_b_02","I don't want to quibble, but wasn't that a long time ago?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_two_c_01","He doesn't look a day over one hundred and fifty to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Isn't he wearing well? He must live an honest life."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Yes, very impressive. I took special care over the design when I started dreaming."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Thank you. I'm very pleased with what I've dreamed here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","I just wish we were allowed on the prettier decks. I'm sure there must be some."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","If only we weren't confined to such utilitarian passageways ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_four_b_01","What's so strange about it? It's much nicer on the Mourningstar than it is on Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Perhaps he doesn't want to be bothered by your ceaseless questions, sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_four_c_01","I wish I could stay on the ship."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_four_c_02","I'd like an office. And a desk ... Oh! And a name plate!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He's certainly very thorough. He knows much we don't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_one_b_02","We're an acquired taste. I'm sure he'll acquire us eventually."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Don't worry! He'll warm to us. I mean ... who wouldn't?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_one_c_02","My Beloved says he's forever watching his back. Never eats anything that has left his sight."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_a_01","People keep telling me that Rannick is held in considerable esteem. Don't see it myself."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_a_02","Have you noticed how everyone falls over themselves to keep Rannick happy?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_a_03","Rannick possesses authority beyond his rank, did you notice that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_a_04","My Beloved says Rannick is bound for great things. Or death. One of the two."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_b_01","My Beloved says that Rannick doesn't care about that. All he has is his work."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_b_02","I don't think he cares. He seldom thinks of himself, only Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_c_01","I suggest you don't upset him. I don't think you'd like what follows."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_three_c_02","He is a hollow man, filled with another's purpose. What happens if that purpose fails, I wonder?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Oh, my Beloved says he doesn't mind ... as long as Rannick does a good job."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_two_b_02","I'm sure your opinion means a lot to both Rannick and my Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_two_c_01","I could talk to him, if you'd like? After all, no one knows my Beloved better than me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_rannick_two_c_02","For some, faith is a closely guarded possession. Rannick's zeal goes deeper than you perceive."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_servitors_one_b_01","They never look happy, did you notice? They never look anything at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_servitors_one_b_02","They perceive a world we cannot see. I suppose some might call them blessed."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_servitors_one_c_01","Ah, but are we any less the cogs in the Imperium's great machine?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_servitors_one_c_02","We all serve my Beloved, don't we? Only some of us serve with pieces missing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Novitiates are little more than children when they are transformed. It's quite sad, really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","What's that, Beloved? A Biscopea? And did you have one of those?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Oh, I don't know Beloved. I think I'd quite like a Catalepsean Node."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","My Beloved just told me how they get the Black Carapace in, and now I feel all... icky."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Yes, Beloved, they're talking about the Adeptus Astartes. No, no... the good ones."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","My Beloved says you should be careful what you wish for."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","It'd be nice to save Atoma, wouldn't it? I don't think the Space Marines would take much care."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","When I dream of Space Marines, I see death... So much death!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_01","When Guilliman returned, My Beloved was the happiest he's been in ages!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_02","The return of Roboute Guilliman has made My Beloved very happy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_03","Many don't believe Roboute Guilliman has really returned, but My Beloved assures me it's true."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_04","Yes, Beloved, I know you're happy about Guilliman's return. Others are sure to follow."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","My Beloved fears the wars will never end. Not now Guilliman is in charge."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","What's that, Beloved? Yes, I think we'd have all preferred Sanguinius."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Really, Beloved? It was xenos magic that did it? The Ecclesiarchy won't like that..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","No, Beloved, I don't think the enemy will let this go unanswered either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","My Beloved says the scale and pageantry of the Astartes remains unsurpassed."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved, it does sound like Guilliman had ideas above his station."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Yes, Beloved, it's high time the Codex was amended."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Everyone prefers the Chapters that don't follow the rules."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","My Beloved is rather handsome in my dream. Or is it his dream? It's hard to tell."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","You wouldn't want to know. It's really quite sad for him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","My Beloved would like us to change the subject. He's terribly self-conscious about his body."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I would very much like to visit you at the Golden Throne."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","My Beloved speaks to me all the time."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He talks a lot actually. But most people can't hear him outside their dreams."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","My Beloved does try, but the High Lords of Terra don't always listen."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I think they're finally asking the right questions."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_a_02","Sometimes I share My Beloved's dream... of sacrifices, given unwillingly to the Golden Throne..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_a_03","Do you not hear the screams of those sacrificed to the Golden Throne? I do. So does My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_a_04","My Beloved is restless. They must be making the sacrifice of souls again... Will it never end?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Only through sacrifice can My Beloved maintain the Astronomican. Without it, we are lost."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","Without sacrifice, there would be no Astronomican. Without the Astronomican, My Beloved would not speak to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","The thoughts of my siblings light the Darkness that others may cross space."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","I suppose they don't die. Not really. They're here in my dream, with My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","Believe me, My Beloved would rather it had worked out differently."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","My Beloved had other plans for the Golden Throne, but fate is a cruel mistress."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","If My Beloved fails, every one of you will become a gateway for the ravening hordes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","My Beloved inhabits a realm of nightmares, so you don't have to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Oh, sweet Brute, bless you for trying to think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Some will tell you it is Warp Drives, or the Astronomican, or Navigators. Really, it's just magic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Think of it like diving into cool, clear water. Only the water is full of monsters that want to kill you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","My Beloved insists it's only dangerous if you think about it. Why not spare yourselves?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","Every voyage into the nothing is a confrontation with horror."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","You fear the unknown. My Beloved says you don't know the half of it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","To gaze into the Warp is to stare into the abyss. And sometimes it stares back."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","My Beloved watches out for me in the Warp. He'll probably watch out for you, too. If you're nice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_01","Time flows strangely within the Empyrean, like unto a dream. Perhaps it is a dream..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_02","Do you feel how time flows strangely within the Empyrean? Do I dream it the same for all of you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_03","I always feel giddy after Warp travel, and time becomes all... wriggly."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_04","My dreams flourish in the Empyrean, but my physical form is at the mercy of time displacement."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","It would be rather nice to just dream forever, until we can dream no more..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Travel from one end of the Imperium to the other might take a few years, or a lifetime, but we'd barely notice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","There are time bubbles in the Empyrean. Must be quite peaceful in there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","All this talk of time makes me sad for My Beloved. The ravages of time are not kind to him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","Oh, you don't want to think too much about Warp entities. It only makes them stronger."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Shh! Don't talk about the Warp entities. If they hear you, they'll get very cross."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Warp predators whisper to me all the time. You get used to it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","My Beloved says only those with special gifts have anything to fear. So... you're mostly safe."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Oh, that is good to hear!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Well that makes sense. After all, I like you both."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","Friendship springs from difference ... or so I'm told."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","I think I'd like more friends. Or a friend."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","Am I missing something? I'm not sure what the problem is."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","I could try to be more unsettling, if you think that would help."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Sefoni isn't responsible for how you perceive her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_01","I do like Sefoni. A sparkling soul!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_02","Sefoni is nice, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_03","Sefoni really is wonderful!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_04","My Beloved adores Sefoni."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","Oh, I like talking to her. Or I like hearing her speak. I can't get a word in."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","She's very unusual, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Well, I don't know that she likes you very much."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","She much prefers me to you. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","I enjoy our little chats. She reminds me of my mother."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","She's very strict, but I like that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Don't worry ... It's all a dream anyhow. My dream. Not yours."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","I don't think complaining changes anything. My Beloved doesn't like it when people complain."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_01","The valkyries aren't exactly comfortable, are they?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_02","I wish I'd dreamed up comfier transport craft. With grav-dampeners."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_03","I do hope there's less turbulence the next time we deploy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_04","I wish we could take a more civilised form of transport to our missions."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","All that bucking and weaving. It all makes me feel rather ill."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","I get dizzy. And when I get dizzy I ... Well, never mind."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","I don't think they understand, Beloved. Not one bit."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","Never mind. It's not like we're going to do it over and over and over and-- Oh."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_war_end_b_01","Oh, I do hope so. I'd like to wake up."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_war_end_b_02","It depends how long my dream lasts, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_war_end_c_01","I don't suppose I mind, but it's all very tiring."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_war_end_c_02","None of you are any help. I shall ask my Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_four_b_01","I think you're right, Brute. [Whisper] But you're not supposed to tell."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Be careful, Brute, too much knowledge is a dangerous thing. I should know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_four_c_01","They have no presence in the Empyrean, so even psykers can't find them. It's very clever."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_four_c_02","If it looks human, and thinks like a human, is it not human? Something to ponder."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_one_b_01","If you stopped to talk to them, you'd probably find most xenos aren't so very different from us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Oh, I think daemons are far worse. It's not xenos who scratch away inside my head every night."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_one_c_01","My Beloved warns of a race of metallic warriors; least understood, and most likely to endure."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_one_c_02","They were here long before us, and will be here long after we've gone. It is foreseen."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_three_a_01","Why does everyone get so cross about using xenos technology? My Beloved did it all the time."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_three_a_03","Why must humanity always stand alone? Surely if we shared knowledge with the xenos we'd be stronger."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_three_a_04","I wonder why we always destroy xenos technology instead of using it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_three_b_01","Those of our order use Daemon-weapons, don't they? Isn't that the same?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_three_c_01","My Beloved says it's a pity we didn't try to understand the Cadian pylons before they fell."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_three_c_02","The Great Rift could have been prevented if only we'd studied those strange pylons on Cadia..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_two_b_01","My Beloved says we owe the Aeldari more than we can yet know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_two_b_02","A darkness follows the Aeldari, a shadow they cannot escape, for it comes from within."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_two_c_01","The Aeldari cling to existence against an enemy they cannot overcome. It's really very sad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_xenos_two_c_02","Theirs is a sad tale - an entire race who've seen their own doom and cannot escape it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_four_b_01","Yes ... An adamantium mind, locked down tight."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_four_b_02","I don't know. She scowls quite a lot."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_four_c_01","Would you like me to dream her as something more ... tractable?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_four_c_02","My Beloved says we shouldn't upset her ... so I'm not going to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_one_b_01","Her thoughts are always in motion, like bodies floating down a river."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_one_b_02","She seems conflicted. I don't know why. I didn't dream her that way."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_one_c_01","I think I'd like to be her friend ... Or dissect her. One of those."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_one_c_02","I could put her back together differently, if you'd like. Would you like that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_a_01","Explicator-Lady is a fascinating one, isn't she? So determined."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_a_02","I do like the Explicator-Lady. She has just the right amount of arrogance ... and fear."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_a_03","Zola seems almost ... afraid for us. Or is that afraid ""of"" us?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_a_04","My Beloved says that Zola isn't as confident as she seems."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_b_01","My Beloved says she's often confused."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_b_02","She's all twisted inside, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_c_01","The last time she spoke, she was wondering if she'd have to kill you. Isn't that fun?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_three_c_02","It must be hard, working for Rannick. Authority without autonomy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_two_b_01","It's easy to have faith when my Beloved talks to me as much as he does."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_two_b_02","I don't need to believe. I know. I can see my Beloved. All the time."
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_two_c_01","My Beloved appreciates Zola's service, don't you Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__lore_zola_two_c_02","Actually ... My Beloved would much rather you all strive for happiness, instead of bowing and scraping all the time."
"loc_psyker_female_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Oh. This is rather heavy, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Why did I dream myself as a beast of burden?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_alarm_01","I don't like that noise! Make it stop!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_alarm_02","Speak up Beloved! It's very noisy in here!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","My Beloved says we're not getting in that way."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","Locked. Locked, locked, locked, locked, locked ... Locked."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","My Beloved says there's very little truth in this place."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","I don't think I'd want to catalogue all this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","All this talk of hidden traitors ... It's very worrying."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Treachery is so very subjective isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","It's such a big place, this archivum. I keep thinking we'll get lost."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","My Beloved says he's very impressed with all this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","My Beloved says we're not being told everything, even more so than usual."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","What fascinating smells. They're going to linger with me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Is the train damaged? Can it not move under its own power?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","No, Beloved. I don't see why we can't simply drive the train off, either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","That seems very clear. For a change."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","All right all right all right. You've made your point."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Tech Priest? My Beloved wants me to ask you about your past."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","How did you come to serve Grendyl, Tech Priest?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","That's very interesting. Thank you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","There's no need to mock me. I was only asking."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","My Beloved wants to know if our support team are real. I mean, really real."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","I thought we were getting a support team for this?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","I suppose we'll see what happens. And have words after, if need be."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Well, that seems very satisfactory. I think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Round and round they go. Round and round."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","All that back and forth with no idea where they're going. Like us, really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Twist and turn. Turn and twist. Is anyone else dizzy?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","It's a very complicated building, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Yes, Beloved. There are unquiet spirits everywhere."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Oh dear ... I hear screams. Are they real? Were they real?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Why are these soldiers hanging back? What do they know that I don't?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","So many soldiers! ... Filthy, aren't they?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","In the quiet moments, I can hear the cartel's victims. The starving. The parched. The mutilated."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","The air is thick with screams, even now. The Water Cartel's victims cry out for justice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","They are gone. My Beloved assures me that this is so."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Fate is cruel, but sometimes justice is kind."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","My Beloved says the Water Cartel rotted from within."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The Water Cartel were so very foolish, letting the heretics corrupt them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","It's very tangled, isn't it? Loyalties in conflict ... the soul in the balance."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Oh dear. It's all very distressing."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Do you dream of your latter days, explicator? Does it haunt you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","My Beloved says that you have done many things you regret explicator. Is that so?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","I don't think I like you very much. I might dream someone else to take your place."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Your secrets haunt you, don't they? I … feel them floating at the top of your mind."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Oh! Look at that sigil. A primitive way of marking territory. I'd have used corpses."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Oh look. The Water Cartel has marked its territory. Like dogs. Or children."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","My Beloved names this a travesty. No one should live thus."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","They live on that which goes to waste in the levels above. How dreadful."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","Tertium's bones are rotting. The heretics are merely maggots come to the feast."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","My Beloved would weep to see his realm thus."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Oh look! The bazaar has become a place of games. Where prizes are doled out in blood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","So much death! And all of it deserved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_shanty_01","This squalor is not my Beloved's doing. It springs from the corruption of lesser men."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_shanty_02","If they could, the Administratum would have us all in the mire. Toiling. Toiling. Dying."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_water_course_01","The river's a very pretty colour."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cartel_water_course_02","Tertium is a living thing really. We are merely microbes, treading its poison blood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Beloved? Please make the elevator go faster."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","The elevator's coming! So are the heretics! Oh ... "
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","What's really going on here, pilot-lady?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","My Beloved says you're not being honest about our mission, pilot-lady."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","What a complicated dream I've created."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Treason is seldom absolute ... Don't look at me like that. My Beloved told me to say it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","No, Beloved, I don't know where the message is going."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","I'd like to know who's receiving the transmission ... I mean, assuming we manage to send it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","My Beloved says that's not quite right, but he won't tell me why."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","So many lies. So little truth. No wonder I'm dizzy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","My Beloved won't tell me what's in the message. He's no fun sometimes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","Encrypted details. Special missions. This message must be very important."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Sounds very dry. It could use a good story to spice things up!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","War is a dry, desiccated business ... until you're knee deep in blood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","My Beloved says we're not being told everything ... Even more so than usual."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","I have had a vision of great carnage in the near future ... Just for a change."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_way_in_01","My Beloved says this will work!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_complex_way_in_02","Behold! I have dream and entrance just for us. Aren't I nice? ... Say it ... Say it!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","So much damage. I don't know if it can ever be fully repaired."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Those heretics have caused so much destruction! How dare they!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","It was a perfectly appropriate question. You could at least answer it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Are you feeling well? You're talking very strangely."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Many died when this factory was seized. Will no one weep for them?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Thousands perished in this factory's fall. They should be remembered."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That's horrible. You do see how that's horrible, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","This is a heartless world I've dreamed. Perhaps I should unmake it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I don't remember dreaming this factory as important, but I suppose it must be."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","I imagine I dreamed many factories of this kind. Surely losing just one won't matter?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Oh … Then I suppose we'd better not fail."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","This is a brutal dream I've created. Maybe I should try to wake up."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_heat_01","The air's so hot ... it feels like it's squeezing me tight."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_heat_02","Isn't it hot? I do like to be warm. But this is a little too much."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_leaving_01","We're going? And I'd just got used to the warmth."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_leaving_02","I've a feeling we'll return. I have dreamt it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","This must be very pretty when it's working properly … Dangerous things always are."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","It's all so very complex. I'm not sure how I dreamed it into being."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","I must say, Beloved, I find this whole place fascinating. And horrible."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","So many levers and switches. Should I pull one?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_production_line_01","I wonder if I could dream a whole tank to life? Wouldn't that be useful?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_production_line_02","My Beloved says that the original Leman Russ drank too much. That feels unkind."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Restless nights and hollow dreams. Souls wear thin in this place."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Yes, Beloved. They sleep here because they've nowhere else to go."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_deception_01","I don't like cogitators. All that clicking and whirring. They're plotting against us, you know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_deception_02","So this is a game, is it? We're hiding something, and hoping the heretics don't find it, yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","I think someone's redecorated."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","There is a point when law ends and self-interest asserts itself, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","It's as if the enforcers were never here, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Echoes upon echoes, and the enforcers the faintest of all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","That doesn't sound very nice. Not at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Life is a wheel. It will turn, if we wait long enough."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","I can almost picture you in this place, explicator. Why is that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You're troubled, explicator. Don't deny it. I'm just trying to help."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Well I suppose it could have been worse. Probably."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","We are not defined by our past, explicator. No. You're defined by my dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I don't know why anyone would choose to go into prison. Present company excepted."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Were I a fearsome warlord, I don't think I'd have a prison as my palace."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","It looks like a child's balancing puzzle. Not that I was ever allowed to play games."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Is that hab really safe? I mean, really, really safe? It doesn't look it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","I don't like it down here. Can we go now?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","It's filthy and smelly and horrible. Beloved, how did we come to this?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","What a revolting smell. Is that one of you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","That stench! I could do with that being a bit less real..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","Oh, shops! Alas, I've no credits."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","All closed. Like a zealot's mind."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","I really don't think the floor should be slanting like that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","I think the hab's off-kilter. Then again, everything is on Atoma, one way or another."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_alive_01","I think the smelter is breaking free!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_alive_02","Yes, Beloved! I think it's working!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","My Beloved wants to know why this place is so important."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","This place holds a secret, doesn't it? Or something close to a secret."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","I'm not sure I understand all that, but you sound very excited."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Yes, Beloved. This place makes better tanks. Isn't that fascinating?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Yes, Beloved. I'd like to know more about the Tech Priest. But she won't tell me, will she?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","The Tech Priest's very aloof. I wish I knew more about her."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","See? Isn't that better? I think we're going to get along famously."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","If you're not happy, just tell me. I can dream you differently."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Isn't it odd that we can get this place running again so easily?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Will it really be so simple to get this manufactorum working again?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","A very satisfactory explanation, if an unhappy one."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Oh, I get it! It's like children fighting over a toy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Beloved? Which way is the smelter?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Coo-ee! Smelter! Where are you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_hellhole_01","It's getting horrible in here ... Can we leave?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_hellhole_02","I want to leave. It's getting too ... hot."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_lifeless_01","This place must be very noisy when it's in operation."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_lifeless_02","The manufactorum's like a living thing, isn't it? Heretics are the disease, and we're antibodies!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","Are we sure there's not a back way in?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","No, Beloved. I don't think running up to the front door's a good idea either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_propaganda_01","It all seems very ordered. And order is the enemy of freedom."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_propaganda_02","I don't know why I dreamed this place. It seems so very ... oppressive."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","I don't think that elevator's going to get here in time ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Beloved? Please make the elevator arrive faster!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","No, Beloved. It's ... not nice here ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","The air tastes like burning blood. Unusual."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","My Beloved says this manufactorum is special, somehow."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Yes, Beloved. There is a strange feeling to this place."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_hack_01","Servitors and machines like talking to me. They know that I can hear the echo of their dreams."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_hack_02","I wonder if the data-interrogator hurts, when it is used?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","While this place may look worse than the habs inside, I'm not sure it is."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","The shacks may not look pretty, but at least they offer freedom. Sort of."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Beloved, I think there's something appalling in here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","I don't think we're alone. There's something... horrible close by."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","I don't like the sound of that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I knew that! I think. I mean, I probably should have done."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved wants to know why the daemon is here. So do I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Why is the daemon here. It seems a strange place to choose."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Well that doesn't sound very promising at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Evils always multiply when left to fester."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Is this daemon in other places too?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","My Beloved says the daemon gets everywhere. It has no manners, he says."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I'm sure my Beloved will sort it all out."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","The evils that go unseen are often the most widespread."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Fascinating! The daemon must have filled the whole elevator shaft."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","No. No. I don't want to ride the lift any longer."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A psychic pathogen? Why ever did I dream that up?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","I don't believe this broadcast is the real enemy. That's just what they've chosen to tell us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I think we're a very long way up."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Are we above the clouds? Please say yes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I don't like walking while I'm awake. It's no better while I'm dreaming."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Oh no. Another long walk ahead."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Isn't the air dry? It's almost refreshing, in its way."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","I don't know about you, but I think more clearly in this thinner air. And I don't want to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Oh. This is nice. If only everyone wasn't trying to kill us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","That which feels better in sunshine always remains lurking in the shadows."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","Did I just hear the doors lock?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","Have those heretics just sealed us in? The scamps."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","I don't want to worry anyone, but I think they just sealed us in."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","Oh dear ... I think we've just been sealed in."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Mourningstar? ... Oh, typical. The vox isn't working."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Erm ... Is anyone else's vox working?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Mourningstar? Hello! Hell-ooo?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar? I think we're trapped, what should we ... Oh, it's not working."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Yes, Beloved. I think we're going to have to kill everyone."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","I don't want to die in here. What will people say about me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","Are we really going to die in here?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","Oh good. We're trapped and alone. How fun."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_01","Exploding valkyries are very pretty, but perhaps not today. We should disable that skyfire relay."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_02","My Beloved says we should disable that skyfire relay so it doesn't rain body parts and broken valkyries."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_district_gate_01","That's a very big gate. But I could open it with my mind, if I wanted."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_district_gate_02","The gate is sealed. Everyone is trapped. It will be a slaughter."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Well, we're here. That's important, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","I forgot what function this place holds in my dream ... That's strange."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Imagine that! My dream is full of trains, whizzing about, back and forth. Oh, I'm dizzy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","It seems this place will be a killing ground many times over before the war is done."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved is very impressed with your knowledge, explicator. So am I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","How do you know so much about this part of my dream, explicator?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","My Beloved says he's proud of how far you've come."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","My Beloved says he's watching you very, very closely. That's nice, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I must say, special issue ammunition sounds terribly complicated."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","I'm not sure I want to use special issue ammunition. It sounds unsporting."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Oh. That's disappointing. Maybe I should dream some for myself too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","No, Beloved. That doesn't seem fair at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","This is all seems familiar ... Then again, it is my dream, so it should."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","Are we going inside the hab block? No? Oh."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","We see all the nice places ... Though I wouldn't say no to more light."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Is it dark in here, or do I have my eyes closed?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_trains_01","Tertium is like a living thing ... The railroads are its arteries, thick with infection."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_rails_trains_02","I like trains. They seem so ... certain of their purpose."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","So many twisty turny twisty turns. And stairs too. I'm bound to get lost."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","My Beloved says we should be careful not to get lost."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Are you sure it's moving, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","This bridge has no sense of urgency."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","It's not a very happy name, is it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","I'm not sure I like that name Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","It's a big bridge. I don't think jumping up and down will fix it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","No Beloved, I don't know how we're going to do that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","Yes Beloved, there are a lot of them!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","I want to kill all of them! Is that allowed?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Oh, I'm enjoying this. I think. Well, maybe not."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Are they still there? Never mind. I can hear them!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","The pulpit's empty. Alas, prayers have their limits in such times."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","No, Beloved. I don't think the preacher should have fled either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","I'm sure my Beloved has looked after him."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","Perhaps I should give a sermon. I can be very uplifting."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Oh, I like it here. Isn't it ... dignified?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Yes Beloved, this is the Imperium I thought I'd dreamed."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_retrieve_01","I'm not really one for carrying heavy things about … but I suppose I must."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_retrieve_02","Yes, Beloved. I think if we're carrying heavy things around, we should be allowed to open them first."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scan_01","I think that servo-skull keep watching me ... Someone tell it to stop!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scan_02","That servo-skull's spying on us! It is! My Beloved told me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","Bright! I feel my spirits lift … Although I'm sure dark deeds await."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Yes, Beloved. It feels good to be out of the depths. If only the view were a little nicer."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Glory to dust. It's sad, in its way. I wonder how long it's been like this?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","We walk amid the ruins of splendour - a foreshadowing of our own fate. Has it been this way long?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","I suppose I can always dream it back to how it was. If I choose to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","There is a sadness to it all … but I find little to be joyful about in this dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I do not approve of my dream being laced with plague. I don't know what I was thinking."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","These plagues are not the only aberrations in my dream, but I suppose one must start somewhere."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Their thoughts drone like flies, did you know that? Buzz. Buzz. Buzz."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","There is no place in my dream for their kind. They'll all have to die."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Can you hear? The echoes of busier times. Not happier, but busier."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Wealth changed hands here in ages past, body and soul too. Everything had a price."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","It is the nature of existence for rise to follow fall. It is for the victor to determine the nature of that rise."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","All this talk of old days is making me nostalgic for a different dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_interior_01","I don't want to sound alarmist, but I fear it's not safe in here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_interior_02","No, Beloved. It doesn't look stable in here at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","Chitter, chitter, chitter. Their minds are like the rattle of keys and the buzz of flies."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","A room full of battered toys. Can we be certain any still function?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","The cargo elevator looks like a giant tongue, gobbling us up into the complex."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","Are we any less machines than the cargo elevator? After all, we dance at another command, do we not?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","The souls of the slain linger in this place … They scream in agony."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","There is the shadow of something … horrible nearby. The worship of the damned."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_approach_01","Yes, the station is very pretty, Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_approach_02","I dreamed a very nice station, didn't I? You should probably thank me for that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Oh dear. My dream has gone all hectic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","It's not really killing if it's in a dream. My Beloved told me so."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","My Beloved says the matter is as good as settled."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Would you like me to bring you back a piece? I find fingers are the best keepsakes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","My Beloved would like to know more about the target. So would I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Don't think I haven't noticed you've said nothing about the target. Because I have!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Well that's disappointing, but I'm sure we'll do just fine!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh well. You can't have everything, can you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","Can you not hear the screams? The suffering. It is a bitter brew."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","This is not a nice place. My Beloved says its magistratum keepers misunderstand his message."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Move a train here. Move a train there. Why not simply ... blow it up?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Yes, Beloved. It is horrible down here. I wish we'd come another way."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Yes ... I knew you'd say that. I did."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Well, that seems satisfactory, I'm sure. Dreams aren't supposed to make sense, after all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","It doesn't seem very sporting, all this. I suppose that's why I like it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Oh, I do hope I get to see our target's face when they arrive. Won't they be surprised?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","But there has to be some hope in my Dream, doesn't there? That seems fair."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Oh, I'm sure we won't regret it. I find I regret almost nothing, in any case."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","No, Beloved. I still don't see why we had to do this here, of all places."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","So first we redirect trains from a marketplace ... now I suppose we're off to buy food in a scrapyard, or something."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Well, that seems reasonable enough, doesn't it Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Very well ... I'm convinced. It all seems very clever. But then, doesn't everything until the screaming starts?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","Look at all these soldiers. I wonder how many of them are going to die?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","Yes Beloved, there are a lot of soldiers ... Grubby, aren't they?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_station_hall_01","I might be wrong, but I'm not sure it's supposed to look quite like this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_station_hall_02","No, Beloved. I didn't dream this place right at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Oh look! Pretty lights in the distance! It does look nice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_station_the_bridge_02","Can't you feel it? The dead congregate on this bridge. Suicides ... The murdered ... The lost ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","This place still hums with the after-echoes of laughter... oh, and screams."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","I don't think I'd want to live here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I can... feel.. the daemon, rushing through my brain."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","The daemon is watching us... It knows we're here..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","I don't think it can be that simple. I think you're lying."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","You're not being truthful."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved wishes to know why we permit the heretics to remain here?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","The heretics will only dig in deeper the longer they're left."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Yes, Beloved. I wasn't convinced either."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","I'm sure he knows best. You will tell him I said so?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","There never really was any law down here, was there? Just bullies."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Enforcers. Cartel. Heretics. The boot may change, but not the stomping."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","You don't sound happy. Then again, you often don't."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","I can still hear the screams. This place is built on death."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","Yes, Beloved. That is a nice statue."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","Will anyone remember us when we're dead? I don't think we'll get statues."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","Oh dear. There's too much rubble for us to get through."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","No, Beloved. I don't think they meant to block the entrance."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","There's a funny smell, did you notice? Tangy, bitter and sour."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Poor hab block. We are all of us worn away in time."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","There's a peculiar tang to the air down here, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","It all looks like a giant tree, I think. We're among the roots."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","Does anyone else hear the wind howling? Or maybe it's the wail of damned souls. Easy mistake to make."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","I don't like it up here. It's ... uncivilised."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_crossroads_01","It's a maze! I don't like mazes."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Well, isn't this a pretty tangle. Tangle tangle tangle."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Beloved! Please! Get the daemon out of my head!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","Out of my head, daemon! I won't let you control me! I won't!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","All empty. All lifeless. It's sad, really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","I don't think these are the ones we want."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Oh ... That doesn't sound at all promising, does it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","I don't think we can permit that. I sense spilled blood and ichor in the near future."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved says he can hear the elevator creaking."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Can you hear the echo in the shaft? It's a long way down."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Oh, I'm sure we won't fall. Well ... almost sure."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Don't worry! I'm sure my Beloved won't let us plunge to our deaths."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","But there are already so many lost souls here ... The damned ... The betrayed ... The lonely."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","Oh, I don't think I could be a part of that. It'd be very noisy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","I don't think I like the idea of a daemon waiting for us. Maybe it's part of a different dream?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Is there really a daemon in the refinery? I do get confused."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Oh. Well. That's all right then. I'm very happy now."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Stop lying to me. I don't like it!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Will we know if we're infected, do you think?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","My Beloved says we're at a substantial risk of infection. That seems bad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","I feel happier worrying, thank you. That way I'm in control."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","My Beloved says the soul rots first, then the body. I don't like the sound of that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","My Beloved wants to know what's special about this pathogen. So do I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","I'm sure I must have dreamed this pathogen into being, but I know nothing about it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Oh ... I'm not really sure I'm any the wiser."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","My Beloved says he'll keep me safe. You too, if you're nice to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","What a horrible, desolate place. [Cough] I think I just swallowed a bug."
"loc_psyker_female_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","Yes, Beloved. Someone has made a poor job of maintaining this place."
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_01","Oh dear!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_02","Look out!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_03","Look out!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_04","Oh no!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_05","It's angry!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_06","You're too close!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_07","Don't stand there!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_08","Get clear!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_09","Move!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_combo_attack_10","It's attacking!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","Yes, Beloved. This will test us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Oh, this looks difficult."
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","I'm not afraid. I'm not!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","We'll have to work together!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Are we to work together?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","Oh, this looks like a challenge!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","Let's kill it!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","We should kill it!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","Ooh.. This should be most agreeable!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","It's horrible."
"loc_psyker_female_b__need_rescue_01","Won't someone help me? I need help! Heelllp!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__need_rescue_02","Oh Beloved, don't let them leave me here ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__need_rescue_03","My Beloved says you're to help me! At once!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__need_rescue_04","Help me up! Please! I don't like it here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__need_rescue_05","Oh no. I've been captured. Again. How did that happen?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","There's always plenty of daemon to go around, have you noticed that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","Too much daemon, not enough reality, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","Squelch. Squelch squelch squelch. My boots will never be the same again."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","Ignorance does not become you, explicator."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","We are all drowning in horror. It might be better to yield to the current."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","My Beloved never smiles when he talks about Atoma lately."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","Take a deep breath, explicator. It's all going to be fine."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","You sound angry. I don't think that helps very much."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","My Beloved says that the heretics worship disease. They're very odd."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","Worshipping sickness of the body suggests sickness of the mind, doesn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","My Beloved says it's more complicated than that, but won't say why. Odd."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","That's horrible. And stupid. They deserve to die."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","What's a 'Nurgle'? It keeps running through these heretics' brains."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","There's a word at the top of everyone's minds ... 'Nurgle'. And there's jolly laughter too."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Oh dear. Have I said something wrong?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","My Beloved says it's deeds that matter, not words."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","Yes, Beloved. There's slime everywhere. Daemonic slime, I'm told."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","Tertium is rotten through. What we see now is just corruption oozing to the surface."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","My Beloved agrees, though there's a funny note in his voice ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","But plague always returns, doesn't it? Always, always, always."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_01","I can hear something ... Like a low, heavy heartbeat. But only in my thoughts."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_02","Beloved ... ? What is that creature?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_03","I can hear its thoughts ... They're cheery and vile ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_04","Oh! ... A creature in the wall. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_05","I don't think I want that as a pet. No thank you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_06","[Disgusted Noise] I don't like that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_07","That is a truly vile creature. Can't you feel its malice?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_08","Don't be afraid of that creature. It just wants to smother us with pestilence."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_09","Stay away from me, vile thing! ... Oh, it's stuck to the wall. Good."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_10","The physical world rebels ... That creature is only a harbinger to what is coming."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_01","Beloved? I don't want to dream this anymore!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_02","It's all so lumpy and ugly ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_03","No. I don't like any of this. It'll have to go."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_04","It's like some vast, hungry beast, scratching at the corners of our universe ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_05","The infestation can't be stopped, you know. Only delayed."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_06","I don't like these extrusions. Maybe if I close my eyes, they'll go away? ... Oh ... No ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_07","My Beloved says these growths are very old, and also very young. I don't understand."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_08","We must drive this infestation back or it'll swallow us all!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_09","These growths are horrid. I want them gone! Now!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_10","Why can't we ever go anywhere nice? It always gets worse. Always."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_01","I don't like that shrine ... I think it's alive ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_02","The shrine shrine is a living thing ... after a fashion ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_03","No Beloved, that shrine shouldn't be here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_04","Companions! I'd stay away from that shrine!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_05","I don't like that shrine ... I think it's looking at me ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_06","A shrine? No. It's something worse ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_07","[Growl] That shrine has no business being here ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_08","There's a daemon in that shrine ... It's crawling through my thoughts ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_09","No ... No ... I don't want to go near that shrine ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_10","Oh look, it's daemon shrine. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","Oh no! I didn't volunteer for this. Then again, I didn't volunteer at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","Yes. It's always there. Waiting beneath the surface. Hungry."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","Yes ... There's something out there ... A presence. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_female_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","I feel something ... We are candles before its black flame."
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_01","Stop it! Stop shooting!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_02","They're shooting me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_03","Pinned down!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_04","They won't let me move!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_05","I can't move!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_06","Don't just stand there! Shoot them!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_07","So much fire! Help!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_08","Yes Beloved, I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_09","Yes Beloved, there's too much fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__pinned_by_enemies_10","I'm pinned! Help!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_ogryn_01","Poor Brute, alas."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_ogryn_02","The Brute is slain."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_ogryn_03","They killed our Brute!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_ogryn_04","You killed the Brute! You monsters!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_ogryn_05","No! Brute! Beloved, bring him back!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_psyker_01","Sibling? No!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_psyker_02","Sibling? Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_psyker_03","You killed my Sibling, you ... you ... !"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_psyker_04","They've killed my Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_psyker_05","I will avenge you, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_veteran_01","Oh no! The Veteran's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_veteran_02","Roughneck? ROUGHNECK?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_veteran_03","The Roughneck is slain!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_veteran_04","Roughneck? Oh dear."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_veteran_05","Beloved, I commend the Roughneck to thee."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_zealot_01","Oh is the Zealot dead?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_zealot_02","They killed our Zealot!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_zealot_03","The Fanatic's dead!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_zealot_04","Goodbye, Fanatic!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_zealot_05","Alas, poor Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_01","Did you mean to hit armour?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_02","Yes, Beloved, they keep hitting armour."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_03","Does it have no weak point?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_04","It's armoured there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_05","It's armoured there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_06","Stop hitting armour! If it pleases you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_07","Look for a weak bit."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_08","There must be a weak bit."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_09","I'm sure it's weak somewhere."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_10","Why do you keep hitting the armour?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__power_circumstance_start_b_01","No, Beloved. I can't see in the dark."
"loc_psyker_female_b__power_circumstance_start_b_02","Yes, Beloved. It's probably going to be very scary."
"loc_psyker_female_b__power_circumstance_start_b_03","I might let one of you go first, if that's all right?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__power_circumstance_start_b_04","Don't mind me ... I'll be at the back, jumping at every tiny noise."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_combat_01","Oh… That was easy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_combat_02","I've got… slime on me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_combat_03","You made me do that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_combat_04","I'm still alive?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_combat_05","My dream is very messy tonight."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_end_event_conversation_b_01","Die? It's a dream. I'm going to wake up."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_firefight_conversation_b_01","See Beloved? She isn't that bad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_01","Oh, I don't like it down here Beloved… Beloved? Why won't you speak to me?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_02","Horrible… What is that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_03","No… Leave me alone!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_04","Beloved? Where are you? Where do I go? I don't like this dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_05","At last, Beloved… I hear your voice in the sirens. No, I shan't give up. I promise."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_06","Yes, I will kill them… That's a very good idea."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_07","I should help her, Beloved? Are you sure? She wasn't very nice to me…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_08","Get out of my way!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_09","The elevator's still working, Beloved? Oh, how nice… I think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__prologue_monologue_10","Beloved… I am still dreaming, aren't I?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_a_01","No, Beloved. I don't think it's right that the others can't hear you like I do. Maybe they aren't real."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_c_01","No, Beloved. I don't think they're talking to me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_macro_a_01","I do hope one of you knows why we're here. Don't tell Morrow, but I'm not very good at remembering orders."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_purpose_b_01","I wasn't sure at first, but now I think I'm quite enjoying myself. Except for when I get shot."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_quibble_b_01","Oh, I don't know. I quite like them. They have a strange way of looking at the world."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_small_brain_a_01","I don't know how the others manage it, being so deaf and blind to the world."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_small_brain_d_01","Well, I am ... I'm not sure about the rest of you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_trusted_b_01","I'm not sure we are. We're just not as distrusted here as we were before."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_value_c_01","And me ... Only, if we don't, they'll probably kill us. Which wouldn't be very nice at all."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_weaponry_b_01","Careful, Sibling. It's not good to start talking like that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_worse_c_01","Yes. Almost cheerful. Oh ... you don't think they've got the plague?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_01","That Ogryn's impressive!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_02","Well done, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_03","Oh yes, Brute! Do it again!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_04","Such carnage! The Brute knows his work."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_05","You are such an artist, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","Oh. Very well done, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_02","It's so pretty, Sibling! Such colours."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_03","We Psykers are good at killing!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_04","Where did you learn to do that, Sibling?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_05","Teach me to do that, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_01","A Veteran should be a killer!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_02","You do have talent for killing, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_03","The Roughneck's a beast."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_04","I'm glad you're on my side, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_05","You're souring my dream with blood, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_01","The Fanatic's out of control..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_02","Must you make such a mess, Zealot?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_03","You're getting blood all over my dream, Fanatic!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_04","No, Beloved, we can't stop the Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_05","Oh, the Zealot'S gone berserk."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_01","Oh… erm…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_02","Is this alright, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_03","Are you hurt, Brute? I'm sure it will mend."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_04","I'm sure it's nothing, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_05","Can you still fight, sweet one?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_06","Here Ogryn, let me help you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_07","Please… I only mean to help."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_08","Don't hurt me, Ogryn… I'm here to help…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_09","I'm helping, Ogryn. You… understand, yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_10","It's… Yes… Friend? Friend."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_01","This doesn't mean I trust you, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_02","I'll help, Sibling. This time…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_03","Well, I couldn't leave you, Sibling, could I?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_04","I think you owe me now, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_05","I… Just don't betray me… Yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_06","Up, Sibling. They're watching us."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_07","Come on… Rise…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_08","Oh… You're not dead."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_09","I thought you were dead, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_10","No, Beloved, I can't leave them."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_01","I have you, Roughneck…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_02","Stop squirming, Roughneck…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_03","It's not that bad, Roughneck…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_04","Stop making such a fuss, Veteran…"

"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_08","I'm here! Don't worry!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_09","Hush, Beloved. They're going to be fine…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_10","Yes I do know what I'm doing, Beloved…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_01","Need help, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_02","See, Fanatic? You do need me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_03","Plenty left to kill, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_04","You're not dead yet, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_05","You wouldn't want me to outlast you, Zealot…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_06","It doesn't look that bad, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_07","You should probably get up, Zealot. If you'd like."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_08","I'll help!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_09","You need my help. Don't be difficult."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_10","I'm going to help you. Please don't get angry."

"loc_psyker_female_b__ranged_gameplay_04_01","Oh yes. Dead is so very final."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_carnival_a_01","It all looks so jolly, doesn't it? But I'm sure it isn't really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_carnival_a_02","No, Beloved. I don't think it's going to be very nice here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_carnival_a_03","I can feel the riot of emotions from here. It's a very heady brew."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_habculum_01","So many people live down here. Makes it a good place to hide if you're on the run."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_habculum_02","I don't like the Sector Habculum. Too many enforcers, informants and witchseekers ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_habculum_03","Why did I have to dream up this maze?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_mechanicus_01","A grand edifice, but the wheels of industry grind us all to offal."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_mechanicus_02","So many unhappy souls worked to exhaustion … I hate it here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_mechanicus_03","Yes my Beloved. They do seem rather obsessive..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_periferus_01","My Beloved says he is blind in this place. I wonder why that is?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_periferus_02","I sense all manner of turbulent souls nearby. Did they make this place what it is, or vice versa?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__region_periferus_03","This place smells like fear... Beloved, why do I dream these things?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_01","Oh! No more ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_02","Why's the gun stopped working?!"

"loc_psyker_female_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_09","No, Beloved, I've no ammunition."
"loc_psyker_female_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_10","Oh no. My gun's empty."
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_01","Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_02","Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_03","How do I reload? Ah."
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_04","I'm reloading!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_05","Oh. I should reload."
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_empty_01","Out?! Which bit goes where?!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_empty_02","Shield me! I'm reloading!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_empty_03","Companions? I'm out!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_empty_04","Oh! Empty!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__reloading_empty_05","Empty! That's unfortunate."
"loc_psyker_female_b__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_01","That's a nasty wound, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_b__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_02","Is my Beloved testing your fortitude, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_03","That looks deep, Fanatic. Are you dizzy?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_04","Oh, Beloved. Our Zealot's a real mess."
"loc_psyker_female_b__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_05","Do you need help Zealot?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_calling_for_help_01","Oh…"

"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_calling_for_help_03","Yes, I hear you!"

"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_calling_for_help_06","Oh dear…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_calling_for_help_07","How unfortunate…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_calling_for_help_08","Sorry!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_calling_for_help_09","That's a shame…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_calling_for_help_10","Oh no!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_01","At once!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_02","Of course!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_03","Yes, of course!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_04","Shall we, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_05","Do they deserve our help, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_06","Very well!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_07","If I can!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_08","Let's see…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_09","Covering fire? Can I do that?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_cover_me_10","Covering fire? Oh, I suppose we might."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_01","You really should heal."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_02","Dying heroes end up dead. Heal."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_03","You should tend your wounds."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_04","Heal up. No one's impressed by blood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_05","That's a lot of blood."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_06","Yes, Beloved. They should heal."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_07","Yes, Beloved. That blood should be on the inside."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_08","Oh. Don't you look pale?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_09","Does that hurt? It looks like it hurts."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_critical_health_10","Heal those wounds. You're making my dream all messy."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_01","I never doubted."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_02","Thank you for this victory, Beloved."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_03","Oh… so it is dead?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_04","It's much less terrifying when it's still…"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_05","It has gone from my dream. Good."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_06","It no longer stains my dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_07","The souls of its victims have fallen silent."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_08","Dead. Dead dead dead."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_09","It's still ugly."

"loc_psyker_female_c__asset_unnatural_dark_a_04","Lumens down.. it's going to be dark."
"loc_psyker_female_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_01","Darkness ahead!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_02","Watch your step, colleagues."
"loc_psyker_female_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_03","I don't trust this darkness..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_04","Proceed with caution."
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_01","Where have you all gone?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_02","Irksome. They've lost me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_03","To where have they disappeared?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_04","They should have stayed with me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_05","Where have they wandered off?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_06","Where are they? No sense of protocol."
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_07","The solitude is not unwelcome, but I should find them."
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_08","Not even an enforcer would linger here alone…"
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_09","Can you hear me? You seem to have lost me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__away_from_squad_10","Am I abandoned, or are they lost?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_01","A necessary fate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_02","I take no pleasure in this."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_03","Deserved, but not relished."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_04","You have paid."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_05","The Lex speaks through me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_01","Not entirely displeasing."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_02","Proportionate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_03","You cannot hide from the Lex."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_04","Justice finds all."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_05","A deserved fate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_01","Let the Warp flow through you!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_02","Regrettable, but deserved!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_03","I smite thee!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_04","Behold my power!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_05","Your punishment is overdue!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_psy_c_c_01","I am glad you find pleasure in your work."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_psy_c_e_01","The irony is not lost on me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_lex_a_01","It pleases me to see you uphold the Lex Atoma so vigorously. Perhaps we are alike, after all."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_lex_c_01","Ah, but just as a soul might serve the Emperor unknowingly, so too might it uphold His holy law, yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_alert_a_01","You must stay alert, Brute. We cannot afford to be taken unawares."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_alert_c_01","Let us hope that is so. I am relying on you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_armour_b_01","Alas, I do not believe they make powered armour in your gargantuan scale, large associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_armour_d_01","I suspect even you could not bear such a burden."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_art_a_01","Tertium was once renowned for its sacred hololiths. I can only hope that not all have been lost to the war."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_art_c_01","Yes, yes indeed. It is plainly our duty to preserve such labours so that others may find inspiration."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_callous_a_01","I fear yours is a calloused soul, scarred over with disappointment and loss."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_callous_c_01","You need not carry it alone. But asking for aid takes great courage."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_callous_e_01","It will surely be worthwhile in the end."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_change_a_01","You are a gentle soul, large associate. You deserve better than endless war."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_change_c_01","But we can still hope for better. If we do not, then change will never come."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_change_e_01","I know, Brute. But it gets easier when shared with friends."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_cheer_b_01","So long as you're not letting it get you down."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_cheer_d_01","Oh. And when does that start, exactly?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_complex_a_01","You are a constant source of surprise for me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_complex_c_01","Your manner and your appearance are both slovenly, but your dedication is as unswerving as adamantium."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_complex_e_01","Yes. You are quite fascinating in what I'm not certain is a healthy way."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_constant_b_01","I fear their confidence outweighs their common sense."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_constant_d_01","It is a constant battle of self-awareness ... Wait, what did you say?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_a_01","Once Tertium is cleansed of its despoilers, it is my hope to be part of the effort to restore its enforcers to a vital, dedicated force."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_c_01","A simplistic appraisal, and one not worthy of you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_elsewhere_b_01","It has a certain dry satisfaction ... if employed with care and precision."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_elsewhere_d_01","Alas, I believe your strengths lie elsewhere."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enforcer_b_01","I ... cannot concur. You have no loyalty to structure, only people. You have no use for directives of which you do not approve."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enforcer_d_01","Regrettably, there is some merit in what you say."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_forgiveness_b_01","Mercy? Truly, this is not a word I associate with you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_forgiveness_d_01","You are perhaps a deeper soul than I first believed ... I must think on this."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_goals_a_01","I only hope that while we are out here pursuing Grendyl's goals, someone is attending to the needs of the citizens."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_goals_c_01","A cynical viewpoint ... but not one without merit."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grand_a_01","You are very loud, Brute. I think you enjoy the sound of your own voice."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_grand_c_01","I think you mean ""grandiloquent""."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_happy_b_01","I suppose it is good to hear you happy in your labours."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_happy_d_01","I cannot concur, if only because if this is you at your most content, I shudder to imagine what the reverse looks like."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_heretics_a_01","We must press on, associates. We yet have many heretics upon whom to deliver judgement."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_heretics_c_01","Are you certain? Am I no longer an abomination in your eyes?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_honourary_b_01","That sounds like high praise."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_honourary_d_01","Then I accept with grace and gratitude."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_humour_a_01","It's very strange. It's as though the heretics don't want us here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_humour_c_01","In my experience, all humour is peculiar. We survive this life however we can."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_krall_a_01","I have seen you lingering near Krall's surgery. Are you considering altering your appearance?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_krall_c_01","Then why do you haunt his place of business?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lex_b_01","Indeed it is so. But I sometimes fear that small transgressions escape his sight nonetheless. "
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lex_d_01","Thank you. That is of some comfort."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_light_a_01","Destiny is an inconstant master. It promises much, but seldom delivers in line with pledges given."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_light_c_01","I do, but it may be our trials are beyond his influence. Even the brightest light needs fuel to continue shining."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loot_a_01","I hope that I will not catch you looting."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loot_c_01","[Sigh] You never change."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loot_e_01","Perhaps. It seems someone must."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mentor_b_01","Who knows, perhaps with proper guidance I might earn even that?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mentor_d_01","It sounds as though you are volunteering for the task."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindfulness_b_01","Really? How kind. I did not think you cared one way or the other."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindfulness_d_01","And how does that balance fall at this hour?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_poking_around_b_01","And why would I do that?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_poking_around_d_01","One of those is true. The other false. I will leave you to decide which is which."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_praise_a_01","I admire your loyalty ... Your determination."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_praise_c_01","Why must praise be conditional? Sometimes it is enough to speak truth concerning virtue."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_precision_a_01","You would do well to learn precision of thought and deed. You would be more effective."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_precision_c_01","That is a curious perspective. "
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_punishment_a_01","You remain a mystery to me, Fanatic. You are clearly a learned woman, but the concept of mercy escapes you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_punishment_c_01","The psyker? Go on, say it. I know it to be true."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_punishment_e_01","And which am I?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_b_01","And that purpose ... would it be tolerance and kindness?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_d_01","Yes, I rather expected you to say that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reverence_a_01","Remarkable to think that even now the Emperor watches over us and protects us from the horrors of the Warp."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reverence_c_01","I feel his hand ever on my shoulder. It is a great comfort. You know this, for you feel it too, do you not?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reverence_e_01","High praise indeed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rigor_a_01","Your dedication humbles me, even if your methods are not to my taste."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rigor_c_01","Such a day may be a long time in coming."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_serious_thought_a_01","Your thoughts are a constant pressure Brute, primal and vigorous."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_serious_thought_c_01","A fascinating idea. Can one become a genius through sheer grox-headedness?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_solace_a_01","I wish I could offer you some solace, associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_solace_c_01","I fear that your rage festers somewhere deep within. You turn it outward to avoid resolving your pain."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_solace_e_01","Yes. That is my concern."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stinky_b_01","Interesting ... do you have a particularly sensitive nose?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stinky_d_01","One of the eternal verities, I fear."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_understanding_a_01","You would have made a fine enforcer, but for your temper."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_understanding_c_01","When a riot threatens, indeed. But not when quiet and understanding are called for."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unsettled_a_01","I sense that you are unsettled."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unsettled_c_01","Examine our surroundings. Only a psychopath would be dauntless in our circumstances."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vocation_b_01","I was. It was more to me than a vocation. It was my purpose."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vocation_d_01","You see, now I am curious as to which passage of the lex troubles you so."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vocation_f_01","Of course. I have heard many say the same."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wolf_b_01","I too dreamt of something wicked: a wolf hiding in the shadows, waiting to devour this city and everything in it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wolf_d_01","This was no animal. It had a mind of malice."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_zola_dream_a_01","Last night, I dreamt of Zola. Two Zolas, in fact."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_zola_dream_c_01","It was not like ... whatever you are picturing. They quarrelled, and in the end one killed the other. I wonder what it meant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_raucous_a_01","Yours is a raucous soul."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_raucous_c_01","Alas, I do not have the ready supply of liquor that lends you this “passion”."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_raucous_e_01","Never while I’m on duty. But there will come a time when I am not."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_reclaimed_a_01","Atoma must be reclaimed! Atoma will be reclaimed!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_reclaimed_c_01","And the innocent be saved?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_aura_a_01","Your aura is always awhirl, Sibling. I grow dizzy just watching you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_aura_c_01","You mischaracterise my time as an enforcer. I was valued ... until I was not. I remain grateful for my induction into the ways of the Lex."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_bulk_a_01","Alas associate, your prodigious bulk--"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_bulk_c_01","Very impressive, but you do have an unfortunate habit of getting in the way."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_collected_b_01","Thank you, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_collected_d_01","Then be assured that it does, and please resist the temptation to seek confirmation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_collected_f_01","I hope that was a poorly-advised attempt at humour."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_02_b_01","And I hope enough of me remains to be grateful. But please, do not act hastily. It's a hard mistake to recover."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_06_b_01","Was that supposed to be sympathy?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_06_d_01","Your objective truth, perhaps."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_team_protocol_a_01","We would make a good team, Sibling. If only you would learn some protocol."
"loc_psyker_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_team_protocol_c_01","Then I feel sorry for you. There is freedom in serving something greater."
"loc_psyker_female_c__calling_for_help_01","I need assistance!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__calling_for_help_02","Help!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__calling_for_help_03","Backup now, please!"

"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_01","We're here to fight, not scavenge, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_02","Calm yourself, Brute. There'll be provisions enough once we're done."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_01","Calm yourself, associate. Remain vigilant, and we will prevail."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_02","Vigilance will see you through, Sibling. Vigilance and a cool head."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_a_01","Tactically, our situation is less than sound."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_a_02","This is not the battleground I would have chosen."

"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_a_02","A trained Hound is a fearsome opponent. These beasts are of a lesser calibre."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_01","I concur. The peril is less than we might assume."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_02","A reassuring sentiment, Sibling. Thank you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_01","That's ... unusually cheerful for you, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_02","Well said! Optimism is vital for good morale."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_01","Faith alone will not preserve us. Teamwork is all."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_02","Agreed. The hunters rely on surprise. How we react to that is our choice."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_01","I, at least, will not abandon you should you become lost."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_02","Keep your head! Panic serves no one and nothing."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_01","Wise words, associate, and aptly timed. "
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_02","Though I cannot believe I am saying this, we would do well to follow the Fanatic's advice. "
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_06_b_01","Much obliged. Good colleagues are hard to come by."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_07_b_01","It's in the spirit, if not the letter of the Lex Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_09_b_01","Most gracious of you, large associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_13_b_01","I assure you, Tertium's normally more fragrant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_14_b_01","It can also be a useful tool, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_15_b_01","A good enforcer both thinks and obeys."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_01_b_01","It would be well-earned, hefty associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_07_b_01","Duty's something that chooses us, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_12_b_01","I admit, sometimes one must search for the satisfaction in some tasks..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_16_b_01","That seems likely."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_17_b_01","If we find someone who is, I certainly hope they're an ally."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_04_b_01","Yes. But don't remind me of it, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_08_b_01","Adequate backup perhaps?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_12_b_01","I refuse to enter a bar with you ever again after last time, Ogryn..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_16_b_01","[Disgusted Grunt] Throne's sake. I refuse to deal with that again. It's someone else's turn..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_20_b_01","Very astute, Ogryn. A professional cares for their tools."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_02_b_01","We may forge our value through duty, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_05_b_01","True enough. It's our lot, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_10_b_01","All too easily, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_b_01","I'll assume you mean the satisfaction of service, rather than anything sadistic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_20_b_01","I'm trying not to, sibling. Most unpleasant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_02_b_01","I admit, this district's far from my former beat."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_05_b_01","It's anathema to any enforcer to abandon a comrade."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_10_b_01","Without care, nothing can thrive."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_b_01","Asleep or awake, just stay alert, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_20_b_01","Now, dreams without death and destruction would be a trick indeed..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_02_a_01","The beauty of the city is in its life. Would that you could see it as I do."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_a_01","It’s gratifying to be on patrol once again."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_05_a_01","Can I trust you'll cover me during the next onslaught?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_07_a_01","I spent so long barred from my duty, I almost forgot myself."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_08_a_01","Without duty, one has no purpose. Wouldn't you agree?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_09_a_01","Trust is our most valuable currency. I hope I've earned yours."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_10_a_01","It’s true that one can’t trust every Enforcer. I've learned that lesson. Painfully."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_10_b_01","It's a shame that brings a disgrace on the profession."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_a_01","Good Enforcers know their beat from the feel of the street. That’s something you can't train."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_a_01","Good Enforcers care about the lives of citizens. Don't forget that’s why we're here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_13_a_01","Gird yourselves. I'm sure there's worse to come."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_14_a_01","How many of you actually know what protocol means?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_14_b_01","I'd been wondering the same thing..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_a_01","No citizen is above the Lex Atoma. You’d all do well to remember that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_16_a_01","One may take pleasure in a clean kill, but there should be no satisfaction found in suffering."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_17_a_01","Everyone is guilty of something, all Enforcers know that. Or can you say your conscience is clean?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_18_a_01","Is the Lex always just? Perhaps not, but it’s the best we've got."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_18_b_01","The instrument of justice is what we make of it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_19_a_01","This task calls for training and discipline. Respectfully, I believe our party lacks both."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_20_a_01","Some believe themselves above the Lex. Not every Enforcer realises, but it’s their duty to prove them wrong."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_b_01","Care for your equipment and it will care for you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_b_01","A fair if uninformative report, colleague."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_11_b_01","Your vigilance is misdirected, colleague."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_18_b_01","A calm head is an asset indeed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_20_b_01","A sentiment I would agree with. If some could just follow protocol..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","No duty should be considered light when citizens' lives are in the balance."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_b_01","I'll grant you, this duty weighs heavy."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_10_b_01","As a former agent of the law, I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_11_b_01","It certainly feels that way, associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_18_b_01","I'm not sure that's tactically sound, or in line with approved protocol."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_20_b_01","I'm not sure that's factually accurate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_b_01","Crystal. And probably strategically wise..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_10_b_01","Quite the expert are you, Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_14_b_01","I concur. We must conserve ammunition."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_18_b_01","It's true that too many good are gone, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_02_b_01","I have to agree. I fear the darkness too, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_05_b_01","We are tools of justice, it's true."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_11_b_01","A preferable reward would be to live."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_15_b_01","Mercy and the Lex must exist in balance."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_18_b_01","I find logic a better ally than hope."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_20_b_01","I concur, this is a time for hard justice."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_02_b_01","How reassuring to know the enemy is so selective..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_05_b_01","There is nothing in death, but an end to duty."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_11_b_01","We must defeat them first, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_15_b_01","Righteousness invites conceit, which obstructs justice."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_18_b_01","Only a masochist glories in agony."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_20_b_01","Perhaps. But that's hardly a sustainable approach."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_02_b_01","It will take more than belief to see us through."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_06_b_01","I concur with the sentiment."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_10_b_01","A conscience is as efficient and less self-indulgent."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_14_b_01","Humbly, I believe I know this city better than you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_18_b_01","Do not drop your guard, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_01","These are dark days for Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_02","How did our betters not see this darkness descending?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_03","I feel eyes on us, always."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_04","How can this place be so full of evil?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_05","Remain vigilant, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_06","This mission tests our mettle."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_07","This duty will be a trying one."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_08","If only there were some protocol for this situation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_09","If we don't have the Lex, we don't have anything."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Focus on duty, and we may prevail."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","It means you are noteworthy, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","Like myself and my Siblings, you're considered interesting enough to be distinct from other humans."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","Economy in combat is good practice indeed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","I consider myself a capable shot, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","[sigh of disappointment] It's imperative you attend to your ammo supplies."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","It's imperative you deploy resources with care!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","I hope you intend to share that ammo."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Arm your associates, or else you'll fight alone!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","You should let your associates resupply their ammo."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","I choose to be prepared."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Short-sighted on my part, apologies."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","This is a wearing situation for all of us, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","Rather attention-seeking of you to mention it, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Try to focus on the task, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","I sense it too.  Do not drown in the despair."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","A worthy ambition, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","The times change, and we must change with them."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Consider it respite, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Use the time to attend to your weapons."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Even so, I'd recommend caution."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","Despite that, it would be prudent to heal."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","An admirable attitude!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","An optimistic approach can be advantageous."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","I can't think why that's not standard protocol, Brute..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","An unconventional approach, but one you seem to deploy effectively..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","You'll adapt to the environs, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","A gratifying feeling, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Commendable indeed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_a_01","Zealots try to forge humanity into their ideal, but enforcers work with the reality of what people are."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_a_02","Zealots may think they know the evil in human hearts, but enforcers are confronted with it daily."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_a_03","Enforcers do an imperfect job with imperfect tools, but at least they’re honest about it, unlike our zealot friends…"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Quite so, Sibling. Lose touch with humanity, and you lose your purpose."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Indeed, Our first duty is to justice. Would that the zealots be guided so…"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","I've found that a will to live is in fact conducive to continued survival."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","Pragmatism is useful, a death-wish is less so, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Ignore them Sibling, though I know it's hard."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","This place hosts a choir of corpses."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","You've told us of his legend before, but you tell it well, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","You mustn't endanger your associates so, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","That would not be tactically apposite."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","I'll take that as the jest I'm sure was intended."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","You can't run from duty, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","We are the defence, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","It's a heavy burden on our shoulders, on that we agree."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","In this city, you'd do better to fight like an enforcer."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","They serve their purpose, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","A disruptive strategy is sometimes advantageous."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Remember why it is we fight, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Discipline and steel are nothing without faith and fortune, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","Perception's a matter of perspective, Sibling. Don't overthink it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","I recommend leaving that one to the Ecclesiarchy, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Drinking on duty is against protocol."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","How indulgent of you, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","I hope you're correct, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","We could certainly use His grace to rout this darkness."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","With that attitude, we are unlikely to prevail."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Atoma will not fall. She is too old and grand for that to happen."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","That's rather your department, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Quite. Would that your colleagues had flushed them out sooner!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","Conflict is the nature of life, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Humanity exists in hope, Sibling. Do not lose yours."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","We are all tools of justice, Sibling.  Morrow also."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","The world is uncaring, Sibling. It's down to us to ensure we survive."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","You should remedy that. Discomfort is a distraction."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Poor equipment leads to poor results."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","An irresponsible approach in an urban area."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","That's not a tactic we deploy near citizens, zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Focus, for your own good and ours, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Delivering justice, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","I'd tone it down around any Zealots, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","It's rather gauche to be so morbid, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","An unlikely team, but not entirely ineffective."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","I admit, being part of a unit once again is gratifying."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","If you didn't have the constitution of a rampant Grox, that would have been a terminal error, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","Their minds carry an unpleasant itch."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","We should detest whatever caused this, not the rotting victims."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Consider the needs of your associates!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Save that medicae for better use."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","I'd advise saving healing for when you really need it, associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Gosh. I didn't realise you were a surgeon too, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","No need to be snide. If you need healing, just say."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Your associates are your home now, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","I'll need the opening note, but I wouldn't be averse to some music..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Be careful what you wish for, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","Enthusiasm and competence are not the same thing, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","Your satisfaction in duty is admirable, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Commendable enthusiasm, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","A novel idea, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","For physical prowess, you're already our champion."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_a_01","Our craftspeople are the most highly skilled in the sector. You’re aware of Moebian Iron? It’s made here. Superb."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_a_02","It’s a shame for our offworld associates that the markets are closed. The things our vendors can do with starch slabs! Quite unparalleled."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_a_03","It’s not to my taste, but the camelid racing on Atoma is said to be superlative. Absolutely riveting."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","The culture on Atoma is quite as impressive as its architecture!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","You're never alone, Sibling. Your associates are here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Focus on your associates, Sibling. We're still here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","You state the obvious, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","Yes, I rather think that's why we're all here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_a_02","Offworld associates may be unaware of Tertium’s thriving liturgical drama scene. Very highly regarded across the sector. Saint Messelina is central, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_a_03","I’m sure you must have heard of Saint Messelina? She is held in great esteem here. You should see Atoma during her festival!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Some of our associates would surely benefit from seeing faith celebrated in such a way."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","Our gifts are both treasured and reviled, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","Very few blunts will ever care for our kind, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","So, you understand the tragedy, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","[disapproving grunt] It would be preferable if there were some of Tertium left after this."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","You cause enough damage as it is."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","This will be faster, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","Why the hesitance?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","It is prudent to galvanise ourselves."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","I concur Zealot. We must remember the importance of our work."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","I suspect... you would?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","Please, indulge yourself, zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Please, go ahead, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Some of us will need to remain alert, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","A question for the ages, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Together we're stronger than even the mightiest are alone, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Oddly, the foodstuff vendors I'd normally recommend are closed..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Please Sibling, have some professional courtesy."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","It's crass to probe one's colleagues, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Pay no heed to the thoughts of others, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","Intelligence couldn't save me from betrayal, Ogryn. It's overrated."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","For once, Zealot, we are in accord."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","Leave? I'd no idea you were such a wit."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","There's no break from duty in this life, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","Wonderful! We have some very moving local dirges."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","I fancy I had a good voice in my scholam days."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Stay alert, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Sleep's for the dead Brute. Unless you want to join them, wake up!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","They do present a tactical challenge."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Would that we had their numbers..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","Whilst observing tactical protocols, of course."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Yes. Provided we proceed according to protocol."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","For once, we agree Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","I concur. A more strategic approach would be preferable."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","You may wish to check your pungency before accusing others."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","I assumed it was the stink of your attitude, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_a_01","Tertium's a wonder - the greatest planetary capital for three sectors, and I daresay the finest."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_a_02","I can think of no greater honour for my offworld associates than to be deployed in defence of the sector’s most magnificent settlement."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_a_03","I’m sure you’re aware of Tertium’s importance in the sector. She is a beacon for all humanity."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","It must be gratifying to be deployed in a place like Tertium. Still majestic, despite the war."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","I almost envy them experiencing the sight of her for the first time! Truly marvellous."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","Blunts rarely trust our kind enough for that, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","An admirable sentiment, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","Their dereliction of duty is a shame that will be punished."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","These Moebians are repellent - turning on the citizens they're meant to save."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Strange. I was wronged also, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","An injustice with which I sympathise."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","We've all faced betrayal, but paranoia is an indulgence we can ill afford. Get over it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","We must learn from betrayals, Veteran, not let them rule us. Mistrust is the easy option."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","A sentiment I broadly agree with, but the delivery is wanting."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","You know, loyalty and duty are not alien concepts to your colleagues, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Behave like enforcers, not soldiers. We want some of Atoma left."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","Your professionalism shames us all, I'm sure..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Your resolve is admirable, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","That's the spirit. Atoma will rise again!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Quite right. Weapons maintenance is a necessary protocol."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","Correct, Roughneck. Look after your tools, and they'll look after you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","If confessions were that easy, enforcers would be out of a job."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","When I worked in confessions zealot, I can tell you my methods were a little different..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","I hope that's so, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","If Him on Terra has come as backup, I'll not complain."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","I advise against drawing attention to yourself."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","If you need to withdraw, feel free to do so."
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_01","We should stay together."
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_02","Curiosity's laudable, but don't stray."
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_03","Why are you leaving?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_04","It would be best if you stayed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_05","I strongly advise you remain."
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_06","I urge you not to leave!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_07","Trust my advice and remain!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_08","Protocol suggests you remain!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_09","We'll be separated."
"loc_psyker_female_c__come_back_to_squad_10","Doesn't take a psyker to predict your end if you leave."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","I'd hoped the Emperor's Angels would grace us with their might, but it seems Atoma's fate lies in mortal hands."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","How reassuring... thank you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","Anyone know of the 'Cicatrix Maledictum'? I heard whisper of it at the Enforcers' Bastion."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","A disturbance in the Immaterium... no wonder we psykers feel a rising darkness."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","The rot runs deep in poor Atoma. Do you believe we'll neutralise it?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","Behold, the magnificence of Tertium. Each spire is its own world, each a tribute to the genius of humanity."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","I'd like news of Tertium's sister city.... but nobody will speak of it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","We need a new strategy!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","It is most resilient!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Take a tactical approach: hit it from behind!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Change up your tactics! Hit it from behind!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","A fine idea!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","I concur! Make it so!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","Zola is more professional than pleasant. That's preferable in my view."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Zola has focus. I respect that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","Mistake not determination for disrespect."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","Her mind is sharp. Do not mistake her focus for discourtesy."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","Throne knows we need an ally with some professionalism."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","We're better off with her formidable mind on our side."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","I believe the explicator may herself be from Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","A daughter of Atoma... that explains her determination."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Intriguing. Now I know where her grit comes from."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Perhaps judgements of faith should be left to Him on Terra, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","How gratifying for everyone you've an outlet for further theological discussion."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Careful. The Enforcers may confiscate that to verify the authenticity..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","Apropos of nothing, you should know Tertium takes relic falsification very seriously..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","Our pilot seems rather wayward."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I must confess, I find our pilot rather tiring."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I find her somewhat improper, verging on unsound."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","I'm not sure she knows what protocol actually means."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","We best hope she's more reliable that she seems."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","We don't have an abundance of alternatives..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_01","I have fascinating news. It's true, although you may not believe it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_02","You won't believe what I saw. Prepare for this information, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_03","Associates, I have a report so riveting you may not believe it!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_04","You know I never exaggerate? Prepare yourself for some news."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","The suspense is killing me, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","I'm prepared to suspend disbelief... for a time."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_01","Our pilot landed a mighty blow on the quartermaster!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_02","The quartermaster was knocked out cold... by our pilot!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_03","The quartermaster took a serious thrashing... from our pilot!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_04","Our pilot socked the quartermaster right between the eyes!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","I confess, I rather wish I'd seen that myself."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","I don't normally approve of hearsay... but that was gratifying."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_01","I confess, our pilot has since risen in my estimation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_02","What she lacks in discipline, she makes up for with tenacity."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_03","I believe you'll find Brunt somewhat chastened."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_04","Then I advise you not to get on the wrong side of our pilot's fist!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","Does something irk you, Veteran?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","What's caused that scowl, Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Illegal gambling I take it? I'll pretend I didn't hear."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Gambling again? You're lucky I'm no longer on duty, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","This foe is a sturdy one!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","So tenacious! We must prevail!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Alter your tactics! Aim for the head!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Aim for the head! And don't give up!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Agreed! A sound strategy!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","I concur! Let it be done!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_01","Even our blunt associates must feel grief's burden upon the sergeant..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_02","Morrow's mind leaks grief. Even you must feel his mourning."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_03","Despite my discretion, I hear echoes of the dead comrades haunting Morrow."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_04","Morrow's memories are so thick with grief they're oppressive to even overhear."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","I've observed that. It consumes him."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","The sign of a strong conscience, I think."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","I believe he sees in us reflections of his lost comrades..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","He is resilient. He suffers greatly, yet endures."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","The sergeant has lamentable manners."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","Morrow lacks politeness."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","He doesn't suffer fools gladly, associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","He is merely resolute, associate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","I prefer my colleagues to be competent rather than charming."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","He's a professional. He's here to lead us, not charm us."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Would you elaborate?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","That news hasn't reached Atoma... What of Xanatros?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","That explains the darkness that haunts him. This was in the service of the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","A dark undertaking... On behalf of the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow's soul has borne much... that has certainly aged."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow's soul certainly appears to have lived a harder and longer life than his body..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Strange things can happen in the darkness of the Immaterium..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","His soul has felt the Warp-taint. Anything is possible."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","He still knows what duty is. That's what matters."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","He knows his duty. That's all I care."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","Colleagues... I find the Tech-Priest challenging."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","The Tech-Priest... I don't believe she is entirely professional."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","I find her mind grating... perhaps it's in need of oil."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","Her manners and attempts at humour are tactically suboptimal."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","I simply think we need to watch her."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Just... Alert me if she starts behaving even more oddly."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","My preference would be to focus on tactics, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Very rousing. But perhaps consider prioritising protocol?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","An intervention from Him on Terra would be most welcome..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","If you could persuade Him on Terra to intercede about now, that would be ideal."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Convoluted language is the enemy of clarity, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","If you want your preaching understood, consider using plain language."
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_01","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_02","I need cover now!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_03","Request immediate cover!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_04","Requesting cover!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_05","Give me some cover!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_06","Covering fire, now!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_08","Requesting cover, now!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_09","Requesting you arrange cover!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cover_me_10","Need immediate covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_01","I'm bleeding out…"
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_02","This seems a serious injury…"
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_03","Is this how it ends?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_04","There's more blood than seems ideal."
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_05","I may not endure this..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_06","The pain... But I still draw breath."
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_07","If I am to die, I will make it count."
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_08","Requesting medicae!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_09","I require healing!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__critical_health_10","Where is the medicae?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_c__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_psyker_female_c__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","It has me!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Let me alone, foul beast!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","I need aid!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","Get off!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_06","Get this monster off!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_07","[Scream!]"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_08","I need help! Now!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","Get away Hound!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","Back off foul Hound!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_01","I can't get away!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_02","I'm trapped!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_03","I cannot move!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_04","I cannot free myself!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_05","Free me!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_06","Help me, one of you!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_07","I require release!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_08","I cannot escape! Come quickly!"

"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_03","Is that a med station?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_04","We can tend our wounds here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_05","Anyone require healing?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_06","A well-equipped med station."
"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_07","We may heal here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_08","A med station! How gratifying."
"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_09","Attend, a healing station."
"loc_psyker_female_c__look_at_healthstation_10","This med station is of utility."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_four_b_01","Is that so, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","I'm sure you're the best, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_four_c_01","We're all His servants."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_four_c_02","As long as we're on the same side, variant should matter little."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_one_b_01","More snipers are always welcome."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_one_c_01","People speculate on the morals of Ratlings. Surely their loyalty should be enough?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_one_c_02","As long as you follow protocol, makes no odds if you're an abhuman."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_three_a_01","Why are abhumans abused so, when we fight for the same cause?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_three_a_02","That we even categorise abhumans as such is abhorrent. Are they not simply comrades?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_three_a_03","Him on Terra blesses us all differently. Why then, are abhumans singled out so cruelly?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_three_a_04","The lot of abhumans is a harsh one. We're on the same side, yet they are so often reviled."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_three_b_01","To my mind, it is both amoral, and short-sighted."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","If we don't embrace them, we are rejecting a gift from Him On Terra."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","Him on Terra gave us such variety to better face our enemy. We forget that at our peril."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_two_b_01","We all bleed for the same Emperor, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_two_c_01","I don't believe this discussion is going to make you any less ill-informed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","Doesn't humanity have enough to worry about without dividing itself further?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","You like tanks Brute? The best are made here, on Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","A well-made machine is an admirable thing."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","A tank is probably the last thing Atoma needs grinding up her streets..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","Atoma's streets have suffered enough without adding heavy artillery to the mix..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","I'm sure you'll do your comrades proud, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","The Guard may be powerful, but they're not precise. That's our job."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","We should focus on the task at hand, not wish others were here to complete it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_01","We don't have an equivalent of Imperial Guard Commissars in the Enforcers. Thankfully."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_02","I suspect our Militarum comrades never encountered a Commissar, given they're still alive."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_03","How effective are Imperial Guard Commissars? Fear's a motivator... but constant terror?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_04","Are Imperial Guard Commissars guided by protocols other than fear, I wonder?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","They're supposed to be very inspirational. They'd have to be, with their reputation..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","They persuade with bullets where the priests have failed with words..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","I wonder how many have deserted due to the very fear of a Commissar. Ironic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","They are a tool, like the rest of us. And tools are not to be feared if properly used."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","I'm sure the soldiers value prayers as if they were bullets..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","Faith may be why we fight, but tactics are why we win."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Faith without combat protocol never won a war."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_four_b_01","[Sigh] There's a limit to how much the Lex can stretch before it's utterly broken..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_four_b_02","I'd been trying to ignore that evident fact, Ogryn. I've not time to report her."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_four_c_01","I'm accustomed to interrogating criminals, not collaborating with them..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_four_c_02","I think I'm running out of blind eyes to turn at this point..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_one_b_01","Obligation pins her to this place. Uncomfortably."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_one_b_02","Rogue Traders are itinerant people. But obligation has trapped her."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_one_c_01","As long as her obligation doesn't sour..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_one_c_02","As long as she does her duty..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_a_01","For a pirate, Shipmistress Brahms has an admirable head for logistics."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_a_02","Brahms has so many vessels to manage... for a pirate, she enacts her duty most capably."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_a_03","Grendyl is fortunate to have Brahms managing the flow of ships. She seems professional, even if her past is not."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_a_04","Grendyl had better hope he retains Brahms. His operatives would be stranded otherwise..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_b_01","Indispensable and dissatisfied... A suboptimal combination."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_b_02","She's under much pressure. How long she will tolerate that, I do not know..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_c_01","As long as she continues to do her duty, I've no complaint."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_three_c_02","As long as she stays on the right side of the Lex Atoma..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_two_b_01","An interesting position you've taken. Some might even say courageous."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_two_b_02","It is intriguing you've not raised this with her directly..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_two_c_01","I trust the Inquisitor knows best when it comes to Xenos, anyhow."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Fear not. I hardly imagine Brahms was collecting xenos associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_four_b_01","Decay is their creed, Ogryn. A messy devotion to make..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_four_b_02","They worship a plague-daemon, Ogryn. Their sacrament is putrescence."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_four_c_01","It looks a horrific end, but they accept it gladly..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_four_c_02","Their Plague Lord removes their fear, their pain. An attractive prospect, to many."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_one_b_01","It's best not to dwell on what they believe, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_one_b_02","They believe them to be Gods, that much seems clear..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_one_c_01","There are dark powers in the Empyrean. Even thinking of them is a danger..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_one_c_02","Whatever tempted these souls to darkness hungers still. Do not dwell on it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_a_01","I've heard a Daemon-ruled Realm of Chaos exists in the Empyrean. A horrific thought..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_a_02","I've heard tell of a Realm of Chaos. Castles of bone, pillars of fire, endless crimson skies..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_a_03","The Realm of Chaos seems the worst of the Empyrean's horrors. Surely, it cannot exist?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_a_04","I've heard whispers of the Realm of Chaos. Islands of evil, floating on a sea of madness..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_b_01","There's horror enough on Atoma, Sibling, without allowing  such thoughts to trouble you..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_b_02","Take as few warp transits as possible! Throne knows what's lurking in the Sea of Souls..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_c_01","During an offworlder's interrogation, I saw a nightmare realm,  boiling blood and Daemon forges...  surely just a nightmare?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_three_c_02","We detained an offworlder once. He raved of glittering crystal labyrinths and impossible fortresses..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_two_b_01","A hideous thought... I'd rather not countenance such a foe."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_two_b_02","The existence of such a being would be a profanity. And a tactical nightmare..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Be thankful for the Astartes, surely the only warriors capable of fighting their dark counterparts..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_chaos_two_c_02","Their very existence is a heresy... I'd not mention this discussion to the Inquisitor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_four_b_01","The terrible portal which spewed forth the Black Crusade that split the galaxy..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_four_b_02","A festering wound on the Materium, from which unreality oozes like blood..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_four_c_01","The daemonic gateway that finally destroyed Cadia, that lone bastion against the darkness."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_four_c_02","I envy you blunt associates, who did not have to hear the agonies of Cadia's fall."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_one_b_01","That would be preferable. Unfortunately, it's not true."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_one_b_02","Assume nothing when it comes to Daemons."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_one_c_01","I advise you remain cautious, and pray that we don't experience an incursion..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Ignore the whispers, and pray that Him on Terra holds off any Daemonic incursions."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_three_a_01","No blunt associates appreciate what Psykers endure to prevent Daemonic incursion..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_three_a_02","Daemonic assault is an ever-present risk. It takes great discipline to defend against it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_three_a_03","I hope I must never ask you to deploy anti manifestation protocols. They're mostly bullet shaped..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_three_a_04","I'm sure I could repel daemonic manifestation. I've trained for it. Theoretically, anyway..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_three_c_01","There's no need for alarm, associates. We Psykers are prepared in this regard."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_three_c_02","As we said at the scholam regarding Daemonic possession, fail to prepare,  prepare to fail."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_two_b_02","They say thousands of Adeptus Custodes died in the defence. A horror beyond belief."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_two_c_01","It is folly to speculate what might have been. We must take comfort in the victory."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_daemons_two_c_02","Of course the daemons would try to besiege Terra. It was inevitable, yet we prevailed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","Perhaps it is harder for blunts to appreciate his light as they cannot see it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","It is not a subject for discussion. There is a right answer, and an answer that gets you shot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","The Adepta Sororitas would provide formidable backup, unlikely though it is..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","I concur their tactics would align with the Ordo Hereticus... perhaps too well..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","They aren't known for their moderation...  more of Atoma may be left without their aid..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","I fear that in their zeal, the Adepta Sororitas may leave us with little of Atoma to rebuild..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_01","How must the Missionarus Galaxia feel, arriving on an isolated world? No idea if they'll find hope or horrors..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_02","They say some worlds who know nothing of Him on Terra. At least until the Missionarus Galaxia arrives..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_03","Imagine knowing nothing of humanity's war... Then the Missionarus Galaxia arrives to enlist you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_04","The Missionarus Galaxia must have illuminated some strange worlds with the knowledge of Him on Terra..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","It seems a strange use of resource when so many human worlds need aid..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","We already have many worlds in need of help... perhaps it would be better to start there."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","It's a long way to travel for an uncertain return."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","Each trip is a gamble, with resource we can little spare."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","I doubt Grendyl wishes our exploits to be disseminated..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","The key feature of a secret mission, is that it's secret. Keep it that way, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Atoma's fate is significant to us, but I imagine means little to Terra's High-Lords..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","Technically, myself. Although I'm a useful one, and tolerated. Up to a point..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","Anyone who deviates from expected norms in a way deemed unproductive, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","Given Him on Terra's abilities, perhaps it is blunts who should be considered deviants..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","If you don't consider Him on Terra to be a mutant, how do you define me so?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_01","Some Enforcer's methods are unsavoury... but the Ordo seems built on inhumanity."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_02","The Enforcers watch the people, The Arbites watch the Enforcers... who watches the Inquisition?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_03","I long to free Atoma's citizens, but the Inquisition heaps suffering upon suffering..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_04","I confess, the cruelty inherent in Inquisition's methods grate upon my conscience."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","I concur. If we're to save the citizenry, it would make sense to ensure some are left alive..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","Their protocols don't seem to allow for humanity, it's true..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","I've seen what happens when interrogators go too far. It serves none but the sadistic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Terrified citizens give the answer they think you want. Aren't we concerned with the truth?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Oh? And you're an expert are you? Been through the training yourself? [disgusted snort]"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Educate yourself, Zealot. The Imperium takes no chances when it comes to my kind."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","How galling for you that without Psykers our Imperium would be unable to operate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","If you were to purge all Psykers, answer me this Zealot. Would you spare Him on Terra?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","The Indomitus crusade is a declaration of the Imperium's strength at the darkest of times..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","The Crusade is fighting to restore the Imperium."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","The crusade will focus on its work, as we must focus on ours."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","The spectacle of the crusade brings hope, it's true. But hope is not enough..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Cadia may have fallen, but its people never will."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","A terrible price... and yet, the Cadians still fight."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","Their bravery spurs the rest of humanity on to serve as best we can."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","Out of the ashes, comes the return of Roboute Guilliman. there is hope yet."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_01","The Great Awakening birthed many more Psykers. Maybe we'll become the majority..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_02","Numbers of Psykers have surged since the Great Awakening. Is humanity ready for them?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_03","Humanity must embrace Psykers, else miss the opportunity of the Awakening."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_04","More Psykers are born daily, since the Great Awakening. A great and terrible resource..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","It behoves us to care for these new psykers, not hunt them."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","It must be terrifying to  have lived one's life as a blunt, then awake one day as a Psyker..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","I remind you that without psykers, the Imperium could not operate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","Perhaps the Awakening is a gift from Him on Terra. We psykers are needed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","Those trapped there will need more than prayer..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","It is impossible to describe the horror of seeing the Astronomican falter... I felt I would die."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","They say a noble Commander oversees the Dark Imperium. Pray for his success..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Be thankful we have work to busy us here. It doesn't do to dwell on such darkness..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","It is gratifying to see our allies grow."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","It's fortuitous for Atoma that Grendyl commands such resource."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","I suspect there's no upper limit on the backup we'll need..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","Let's hope they are prepared for the ordeal ahead."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","I'd rather not know Grendyl's secrets..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","Some knowledge is classified for a reason. Be thankful you're not burdened with it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","We know enough to do our duty."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","We've enough to worry about. Let Grendyl take care of the rest."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_01","I admit, I'd like to see Grendyl lead from the front."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_02","Given the situation, I'm surprised that Grendyl hasn't come to personally take charge..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_03","Something troubles me... Grendyl speaks of Atoma's importance, yet stays away..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_04","If Atoma is considered tactically important, shouldn't Grendyl be here in person?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Agreed. I'd feel more confident knowing the Inquisitor was here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","Perhaps Grendyl's attentions are being stretched too thinly. Not a good sign for Atoma..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","I'm sure Grendyl has sufficient eyes and ears here to remain apprised of the situation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","We must trust that the resource Grendyl has allocated is sufficient..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","You conclude much, with little evidence. Ever considered a career in the Lex?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","That's perhaps not the insight you think it to be, Zealot. I doubt heretics last long in the Inquisition."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","As long as Atoma is delivered from ruin, I don't care what Grendyl believes."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","Faithful or not, do what Grendyl says, Zealot. The Inquisitor is Atoma's best chance."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_four_b_01","You never cease to surprise, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_four_b_02","It's gratifying to know she's clear to someone."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_four_c_01","I don't believe communication is her greatest strength..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_four_c_02","I confess I find her rather wearying."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I'm not convinced she prioritises souls over machines."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_one_b_02","We'll all need significantly more metal in our flesh before tech-priest respects us."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_one_c_01","We're on the same side, even if we're simply meat to her."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_one_c_02","I'd judge she has a few cogs loose, but still has utility."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_a_01","The Tech-Priest's mind moves in strange, mechanical ways."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_a_02","The Tech-Priest's mind is unlike anything I've seen. Unnervingly symmetrical..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_a_03","The resonances of the Tech-Priest's mind are rather...discordant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_a_04","The Tech-Priest's thoughts smell of electrical storms. Most uncomfortable."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Engage discreetly, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Please remember protocol, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_c_01","It's protocol to screen new Enforcers. This is no different."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_three_c_02","It's what they call due diligence. You may not have heard of it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Her soul's hard to read, but I'm inclined to agree, it is aged."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_two_b_02","It's traced through with machinery, but her soul indeed appears old."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_two_c_01","So many years in which she could have learned the art of being agreeable..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hadron_two_c_02","As long as she's still human enough to remember she fights for humanity..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","I hear it's not the kind of job one does for long..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","It's not the kind of work that makes you popular with Enforcers..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","You'd best remain, Brute. You can't put a price on good associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Your continued presence would be advantageous for all parties."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The purser? What do you know?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Gossip is unprofessional and I cannot condone it. Mission-critical intel however..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","She'd be a valuable asset in the interrogation chamber, that's for sure."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","I'm fairly certain my Enforcer colleagues would like a closer look at some of her weaponry..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_01","The purser's prices aren't in line with city ordinances, I can tell you that much..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_02","The purser's prices should be against the Lex. In fact, they might be."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_03","My offworld associates should note, the purser's prices are exorbitant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_04","I wonder if the purser realises how close her gouging of prices brings her to breaking the Lex?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","We've a particular division of Enforcers who would be very interested in the racket she's running here..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Her prices are extortionate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Dishonest Enforcers have been known to simply confiscate what they want. Perhaps they aren't entirely wrong..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","I shall ensure my former colleagues are made aware of this enterprise..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","At least she's straightforwardly anarchic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","I doubt one would last long in such a position without having an edge."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","She is what she needs to be to survive... which is analogous with being entirely ruthless."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She's to be respected, but not trusted."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","The Highborn. Free from trouble, and mostly free from the Lex."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Those in our society who believe themselves above the Lex. And often, unfortunately, are."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","I can't tell you what I'd give to see the Lex burn through those vaunted spires..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","Duty should come with privilege.  Not every highborn remembers that..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","You leave civilian matters to the Enforcers. The last thing this city needs is your heroics..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Don't think nobody is watching, Veteran. This beat is well trodden."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","The gangers here are tame compared to some hives... trust me!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","They're part of Atoma's ecosystem. Doesn't mean we have to like them..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_a_02","Life in a Hive City is hard, but it means something. We are all striving for Him on Terra."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_a_03","I pity those who don't live in Hive Cities. There are some feral worlds without any at all!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_a_04","Perhaps I'm biased, but I believe Hive Cities are the most perfect form of habitation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","I hear that some hives are infested with sump beasts. Disgusting!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Some hives, which I shan't mention, are plagued by parasitic slime. Very unhygienic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Atoma's manufactorums are the best in the sector."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Atomans are rightly proud of their industrial output - this is a planet of makers."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","The skill of the workers is as valuable as the factorum - and harder to rebuild."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","The workers are one of Atoma's greatest assets too, not just the Metalfab."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_four_b_02","The Bell of Lost Souls cannot ring for all of those who die in service, Brute, else it would never stop..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Our deaths will go unmarked, save by Him on Terra. That's worthier than any bell, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_four_c_02","How you did matters more than if your death is commemorated."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_one_b_02","I suspect it would not be an enjoyable trip for myself or my siblings..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_one_c_01","To witness the atmosphere of that sacred place... would be humbling indeed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_one_c_02","To be so close to Him-on-Terra... an honour my kind would unlikely be afforded."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_three_a_01","I reckon Atoma will be in no position to pay her Tithe for a while..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_three_a_02","Death and tithes are the only certainties.. yet I hope Atoma's given leniency in the latter..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_three_a_03","A tithe on Atoma would seem an unfair burden given current circumstances..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_three_a_04","Atoma's Imperial Tithe... do you think it will be waived given the war?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_three_b_01","It must be for the good of all... there's no benefit to Atoma if she's tithed now..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_three_c_01","For a Governor to resist the tithe seldom ends well."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_three_c_02","We've an obligation to the Imperium, yes... but are we, the people, not also the Imperium?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_two_b_02","The thought of so many souls is deafening."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_two_c_01","I have wondered how things might be elsewhere, under strange stars."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_imperium_two_c_02","A million worlds, and people are the same on all of them... an exhausting thought."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","An assassin needs a target... we can't very well just point them at Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","The Officio Assassinorum? That's using a knife when we need a flamethrower."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","They are death incarnate. Pray you never meet one..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Their terrible wealth of knowledge is  almost as fearful as their blades..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","It's very distasteful that you'd even raise that in front of me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","I'm quite appalled you think that a suitable topic for discussion!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Putting aside the crassness of this discussion, Atoma's more valuable intact."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","And destroy the source of Moebian Iron? Good luck armouring your ships without it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_01","Whilst the Inquisition's above it, I'd ask that you still respect the Lex Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_02","The Inquisition stands apart from Imperial Law... I confess, that is uncomfortable for me..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_03","The Inquisition is above Imperial Law. I wonder if it should be..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_04","The Inquisition's above Imperial Law, but you're not. Not while I'm around, anyway."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","As long as I'm here, the Lex Atoma still applies. Understand?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","With such power, comes the need to comply with protocol."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","Pity we've no time to correct the less principled enforcers ..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","I could've used this power in the enforcers. With certain officers, anyway..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","To destroy corruption without fear or favour... I can see the appeal."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","To make the corrupt answer for their crimes... the true enforcer's dream."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","In any investigation, one must know when to stop. I'm not sure the zealous always do..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","If some in the Ordo had their way, my kind would not be seen as Imperial citizens."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","I imagine that is a closely-guarded secret, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","It requires souls, Brute. And it is very old. That's all I can tell you..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Let's hope someone understands its workings. Without it, we've no hope."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","They say the Throne requires more and more souls as time goes on..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","I've heard his tactical genius still guides military protocols to this day."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","He strove for the expansion of the Imperium, did he not?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","His end was strange, if I recall correctly..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","Was he not halted by psychic horrors of the Halo Zone?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_01","We're doomed to repeat the errors of the past if we refuse to learn from them."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_02","It is illogical to deprive ourselves of past knowledge, do you not agree?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_03","Without examining the past, we can never learn from it. This seems inefficient."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_04","Surely a greater heresy than learning from history, is ignoring it?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Him on Terra gave us the wit to learn from history. We should do so."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","The best tacticians learn from experience. It's reckless to disregard our past..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Whatever you believe, it's reckless not to equip ourselves with knowledge."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","Him on Terra is the greatest innovator humanity has known... shouldn't we emulate him?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","A dark time, but one which birthed both the Ordo Hereticus, and Adepta Sororitas."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","The say astropaths can still hear the screams of Vandire's forces..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","We should focus on our own times, lest they exceed the darkness of the past."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Simply because evil has gone before, we should not accept the darkness of our own age."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_four_b_01","Astutely observed, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_four_b_02","Grim dedication, or loyalty? I do not know."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_four_c_01","He seems focused to a fault."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_four_c_02","I find it hard to believe a bureaucrat like Melk can truly understand the reality of field operations..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_one_b_01","To clarify... You mean Lord Darius Melk, a scion of the noble House Straxamus?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_one_b_02","If you're referring to Sir Darius Melk, Lord of the Quartervast, then you may wish to heed your tone."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_one_c_01","How very deferential of you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_one_c_02","I've found credentials earned in the field are more indicative of skill than those entitled by birth..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_a_01","Melk's diligence is obsessive. Almost... guilty, to my eye."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_a_02","I've an Enforcer's eye for lawbreakers. If Melk isn't one now, I'll wager he has been."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_a_03","An honest citizen doesn't treat with lawbreakers. There's more to Melk than meets the eye..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_a_04","Take it from me. Melk has secrets, I can feel their weight..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_b_01","He wouldn't be in his current position otherwise, I'm certain, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_b_02","His secrets are between him and the Inquisitor. We'd do best to remain ignorant of them."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_c_01","His knowledge must be valuable to Grendyl, or he wouldn't be here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_three_c_02","I wonder at the motley crew Grendyl has assembled. Whether desperation or genius is behind it, I do not know..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_two_b_01","It's a little rich that Lord Melk of all people upbraid you for pomposity..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_two_b_02","Your diction is grating Zealot, but Lord Melk is a hardly paragon of clarity..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_two_c_01","Melk's function is to communicate. Perhaps you could learn from him, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_melk_two_c_02","If it's of any comfort, Fanatic, I imagine further clarity would in fact hinder your cause..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_four_b_01","We've enough to deal with without you introducing such fictions, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_four_b_02","If that were the case, I hardly think he'd be allowed to live."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_four_c_01","We should refrain from such hearsay, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_four_c_02","It speaks volumes that you seek such an explanation for Morrow's focus..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_one_b_01","A legend perhaps, but one befitting the man."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Unlikely, perhaps, but of any of this crowd I could believe it of Morrow."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Let's hope he can bring the experience of his long life to bear in liberating Atoma..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Morrow has lived many lifetimes. Badab or not, he's a worthy ally."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_a_01","I wish there was some clarity about Morrow's past. Some of the details seem improbable."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_a_02","I trust Morrow, yet I'd prefer if we knew the details of his past..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_a_03","Morrow's past is tangled... would that we could unpick it and separate truth from lie."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_a_04","If we knew more about Morrow we could quash some of the more outlandish rumours about him..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_b_01","I suggest not attending to hearsay in the first place, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_b_02","I concur. A little transparency would make our job easier."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_c_01","I can't believe that Morrow is spinning his own fiction..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_three_c_02","There's no smoke without a fire. Morrow has seen things beyond reckoning... the details are irrelevant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Morrow's only one man, and yet seems to have been present at every battle in history..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Then Morrow seemingly possesses the gifts of both immortality and time-travel..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Of all the Inquisitor's warband Morrow has the gravitas to make the rumours half-believable..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_morrow_two_c_02","whichever wars he's a veteran of, he's survived them, and is therefore to be heeded."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Her flamboyance belies her true nature."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","She is reassuringly powerful."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","She's a tool, and a tool is only as good as its wielder."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","I sense we'll need more Mourningstars for what lies ahead."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Rannick is a thinker, not a fighter, Ogryn. He'd be little help in the field."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_four_b_02","His mind is what's of use to us, Ogryn. It's best kept safe on the Mourningstar."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_four_c_01","His strategies have proved effective. I see no reason to question them."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_four_c_02","I wish he'd visit Atoma once, if only to see what he is fighting for..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Don't take it personally. Rannick's a professional."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_one_b_02","Frankly, it's a relief to work with a professional like Rannick."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_one_c_01","I'd be worried if an Interrogator gave his trust easily."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_one_c_02","A trusting Interrogator is a dead Interrogator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_a_01","I hear that great things are destined for Interrogator Rannick..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_a_02","Rannick will go far. You don't need to have heard the rumours to see that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_a_03","Have you heard the whispers of Rannick's anticipated elevation?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_a_04","Rannick's on a fast track to Inquisitor, mark my words."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_b_01","So long as he finishes his work on Atoma before leaving us for his bright future..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Grendyl no doubt sees Atoma as a test for his Interrogator. His fate is tied to ours."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_c_01","He certainly has an incentive to deliver Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_three_c_02","Let's hope his ambition provides incentive enough to save us."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_two_b_01","One might consider the greatest expression of faith to be duty. You cannot fault him in that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Service is purely faith in action, Zealot. You should consider that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_two_c_01","Whatever his motivation, his deeds serve Him on Terra."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_rannick_two_c_02","I doubt the Ordo tolerates the faithless..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_servitors_one_b_01","They are simply tools, as are we all."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_servitors_one_b_02","It is comforting to know that service continues, even after life does not."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_servitors_one_c_01","They serve without pain or fatigue. An easier lot than ours."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_servitors_one_c_02","Why shouldn't the Imperium use our bodies when we no longer have need of them?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","They're wrought differently to us, Brute. To withstand the things they must do."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","They're designed to be weapons, Brute. Not all survive..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","They are fearsome. Whilst I'd like their aid, I believe we'd be as flies to them..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","I wonder how they'd see us. Feeble, brief creatures, I suspect."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","I've heard the Adeptus Astartes have a... strained relationship with Psykers."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","The Emperor's Holy Angels have a peculiar attitude to Psykers, given their father..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Are they the best option for a world we'd like to keep intact?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","They are mighty, yes. But experts in crowd control? Perhaps not..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_01","They say Roboute Guilliman's returned.  Throne, I hope it's true..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_02","They say Roboute Guilliman's Lord Commander now. Emperor's Teeth, I hope so..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_03","If Roboute Guilliman truly has returned, humanity may yet prevail."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_04","They say one of the Emperor's sons, Roboute Guilliman, has returned. Dare we believe it?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","The hope his return brings is like a bright flame in the darkness."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","Let's hope he's not too late."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","I believe it's true. I feel that something in the galaxy has moved in our favour..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","I believe he's back. Striding Godlike out of the mists of time, into the fight for humanity."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","Not all comply with the Codex, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Many take the Codex as guidelines, rather than rules..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Like any protocol, the Codex must act as guidance, not dictat."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","The Codex must be a means to an end, not an end in itself."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","I've only imagined  how his mind would appear. Blinding, terrifying, sublime..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","I suspect his mind is now more representative of his magnificence than his physical form..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","They say that those who die righteously will look upon his face..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","I believe his visage would be as terrible and beautiful as his mind..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","He might choose to speak psychically to those of us you call freaks..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","I suspect Blunts could only experience a shadow of his words' splendour..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","It's the High Lords of Terra who enact his will."

"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_a_04","I believe the souls the Emperor consumes must be a terrible agony to him..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","The Astronomican is a terrible necessity... a beacon wrought from death."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","The Astronomican's price is death, but its absence would mean annihilation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","Many know the Astronomican's price, but few weep for the Psykers who pay it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","There's a guilt to surviving the Astronomican's hunger. There but by the Emperor's grace..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","The agony he has endured for millennia is beyond comprehension..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","His watch never ends... the Golden Throne must seem little more than a prison."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","You blunts cannot imagine the terrors that await should the Emperor falter..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","I wonder what Him on Terra would think of humanity's fate could he see it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Ingenuity and faith, Ogryn. Both are required."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Never trust anyone who claims to tell you how it works, Ogryn. Nobody really knows."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Without psykers, there would be no warp-travel, no Imperium."

"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","It's the irregularity I find objectionable. You never know what it will deal you..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","The peril is most acute for those like myself and my siblings [shudder]"

"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","A wise approach, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","An astute judgement, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","You're behaving with more professional decorum than some, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","There's no shame in friendship, Ogryn. Her gifts came from Him on Terra, after all."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","If an ally alarms you so, how will you fare in the field?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Have you considered growing a backbone? That may help."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","This hysteria is unbecoming, even for you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Can you at least pretend to act with some professional courtesy? Sefoni is a colleague."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_a_01","It is gratifying indeed to converse with Sefoni."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_a_02","We're fortunate to have such an accomplished Psyker in Sefoni."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_a_03","I thought the art of conversation had been lost... until I spoke with Sefoni!"

"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","She's an asset indeed. And coincidentally, also very charming."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","A breath of fresh air. Never a bore, unlike some of our associates..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","She uses her blessings from Him on Terra to your benefit, whether you appreciate it or not."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Despite your judgements, she does her utmost to help. That's professionalism."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","You realise that you shun abilities bestowed by Him on Terra?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","I can see how that would be humiliating for you. My sympathies."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Take it up with the Inquisitor if you'd like to complain."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","If you're unwilling to train properly, you put all of us at risk."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_01","I admit, it will take me a while longer to adjust to orbital drops."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_02","Are orbital drops always this unpleasant, or is our pilot to blame?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_03","The Valkyries seem to be designed for maximum discomfort during deployment..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_04","Are orbital drops such an ordeal due to our pilot, or the valkyries? Or indeed, both?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Nobody seems to have considered the disbenefits of violently agitating one's operatives during deployment..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","I suspect Masozi could make things smoother... if she wanted to."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Perhaps we'll become accustomed to it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","It may be necessary, but we don't have to like it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_war_end_b_01","That's up to us, Brute."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_war_end_b_02","It must, Ogryn. One way or another."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_war_end_c_01","We must focus on our part. If everyone does theirs, we stand a chance."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_war_end_c_02","War, like crime, is ever present. We can't beat it, but we can control it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Xenos are like a disease... It wouldn't surprise me if some could do such a thing."

"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_one_c_01","I've heard some xenos are very ancient. Older than the stars..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_one_c_02","I've never seen one, but their impounded tech is formidable enough."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_three_a_02","There are those who think we can learn from the xenos... their tales never end well."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_three_a_03","How to use xenos technology safely... nobody's mastered that trick yet."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_three_b_01","I heard one Inquisitor retained a Kroot Mercenary with a sharp beak and a taste for flesh! A fiction, of course..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_three_b_02","We once impounded a ring containing an armour-piercing laser. The probator said it was crafted by a furry, orange ape!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_three_c_01","I hear there's a xenos that exists as a single hivemind. Imagine! No need for the lex..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_three_c_02","We impounded a shipment of T'au tech at our Bastion. Filthy, but I tell you, I've never seen sensors like it..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_two_b_01","They are a psychic race, are they not? Perhaps they are not as unknowable as they seem..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_two_b_02","I wonder if the Great Rift pains them as it does us..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_two_c_01","They are not our foe here, compelling as their downfall may be."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_xenos_two_c_02","We should focus on the enemy at hand, entertaining as these tales are."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_four_b_01","She's loyal too."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_four_b_02","Her dedication is evident, that's true Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_four_c_01","She has a strong mind. She'd not have lasted so long otherwise..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_four_c_02","She's fighting for Atoma. That's all I need to know."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_one_b_01","The Inquisitor thinks of the war first, but the explicator thinks of the people."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_one_b_02","The explicator seeks justice for Atoma's citizens. We need allies like her."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_one_c_01","She knows the meaning of duty, and she cares about justice. That's enough for me."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_one_c_02","This war is personal for the explicator. I trust her more because of that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_three_a_01","Zola's ambition is threaded with fear. Not a bad balance, I think."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_three_a_02","She hides it well, but our explicator isn't from uphive. I suspect she started as low as one can..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_three_a_03","I suspect our explicator has crossed paths with my enforcer associates in the past..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_three_b_01","She bears a burden of care the others do not."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_three_b_02","She must balance serving the Inquisitor with serving Atoma. It may be difficult."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_three_c_01","I suspect she may find herself at odds with Rannick's methods..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_three_c_02","She balances much. I judge that she does so well..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_two_b_01","She doesn't allow talk of faith to distract her. A lesson for you?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_two_b_02","Then perhaps consider that you don't have a monopoly on faith, Zealot..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_two_c_01","She manifests her faith through service. And does so quietly, unlike some."
"loc_psyker_female_c__lore_zola_two_c_02","From wherever her dedication stems, I am grateful for it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","A heavy load."
"loc_psyker_female_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","I can ... barely lift it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_alarm_01","The alarm controls cannot be far!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_alarm_02","There will be an alarm cut-off beyond the substacks."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","The archivum appears to be in lockdown."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","I fear Archivum Sycorax is in lockdown."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","Imagine what we could achieve were this place to fully serve the Lex Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Record keeping is vital to good governance. I approve."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Traitors often shield themselves from the Lex and yet can be anywhere."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","I pray to the Emperor we will find these traitors."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","This archivum feels like a fortress. "
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Strong walls. An army of servitors. A bastion of knowledge."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","Heh. Not Throneside's prettiest aspect."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Even where there is wealth, there is ordure."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","I suggest we commandeer this train."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Why don't we requisition this train?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","As long as the options have been considered."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Seems strategically sound."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","So, what's your role in all of this, Tech Priest?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","What brought you aboard the Mourningstar, Tech-Priest?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Curiously defensive... one needn't be an enforcer to find that suspect."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","As cold as your exterior. Consistent, at least."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Where's the backup?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","The backup better be here soon."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","They'd better be quick if they're coming."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","We have to proceed, backup or not."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Look at this labour. As sacred as any litany."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","See this dedication associates? Perhaps consider your own work ethic..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","I admit, I've lost track of our location."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","I confess, I'm not sure of the next turn..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_something_big_01","I sense distress and desperation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_something_big_02","There is a foul tang in the air... death and fear are thick here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Are these professional soliders?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","These troops don't seem especially professional."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","I won't cry for the Water Cartel. I've seen too many of their victims..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","I've seen enough of the Water Cartel's dead. Now I can hear them..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","I concur, explicator. I think they're finished."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","They may be finished, but the legacy of their pain remains."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Would that the enforcers had toppled the cartel as fast as the heretics did..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","I'll bet the Water Cartel made easy prey. So much rivalry within..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Very insightful, explicator. You should have been an enforcer."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","I saw it many times when I worked with the enforcers."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","It's gratifying to see a daughter of Tertium rise so far as to become an explicator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Might I ask how our explicator rose so far from her humble beginnings?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","A sentiment I understand."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Take it from one who knows, there's no glory in stubborn solitude."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_insignia_01","My only regret on the Water Cartel is that they destroyed themselves before we could."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_insignia_02","The Water Cartel's sigils lasted longer than they did..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","This is Atoman ingenuity too, but not the sort that is publicised."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","They're filtering the water for scraps. Would that they did not have to."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","The habs here require some maintenence, it's true."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","I think that a well-used building is indicative of character. Do mind the loose slabs, though."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Criminals should know not to trust one another..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","Perhaps the best tactic is to wait for them to wipe each other out."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_shanty_01","Do not judge the citizenry. They don't choose to live this way."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_shanty_02","Would that Atomans were not obliged to live this way..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_water_course_01","I advise against direct contact with the water."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cartel_water_course_02","I think you'll find that this is water. Technically."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","The elevator is on its way. Fortitude, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","We hold here until the elevator arrives! Agreed?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Comms-plex. Mourningstar. Something here does not add up."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","I sense conspiracy in this mission. Tell me I'm wrong."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","""Incorruptible"" is merely a word, it seems."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","An investigation is warranted, and doubtless already underway."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","Can you tell us anything about who is receiving this message?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","Is everything about the transmission's target to remain secret?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","I accept your answer."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","I see. Most interesting. Knowledge is so very valuable."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","I trust we carry vital news?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","We carry important intel, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","It is strange how war often turns on the smallest numbers."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Then it shall be delivered. Lives are at stake."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","I dislike starting a mission without the full facts."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","A team is only as good as the information provided to it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_way_in_01","This approach will serve, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_complex_way_in_02","I believe this is the entrance we seek."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","I'm no Tech-Priest, but this looks beyond repair."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Can this be fixed? It looks ruined."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","If you want us to know what you're talking about, you need to speak plainly."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Affirmative would suffice. If that's what you meant..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The loss of the workers pains me. So many citizens, gone."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Without workers, the factory is nothing. Their loss is a wound in the city."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","You forget that machines are nothing without hands to operate them."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","These workers were skilled citizens. They are not interchangeable."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Whilst I wish all of Tertium to be saved, this seems a lot of effort for a single manufactorum..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Atoman manufacture is outstanding, but Rannick places much value on this one facility..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","As clear as ever. Well, we know our duty."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","The manufactorum will not fall on our watch."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_heat_01","The temperature is not conducive to our mission..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_heat_02","I don't think my lungs were designed to operate in these temperatures..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Time to leave. Most gratifying."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_leaving_02","I confess, it will be a relief to leave this place."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Keep going, and don't look down."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Stay back from the edge, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Associates, don't touch any levers. Please."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","Try to ignore the heat. We must push on to Coolant Control."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_production_line_01","See this armour plating? Moebian steel. Superior to anything else."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_production_line_02","You're looking at more than armour plating. This, is the pride of Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Do you see this? The workers even sleep here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","The workers sleep by their stations. That's Atoman loyalty."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_deception_01","I find deceit disagreeable, but needs must."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_deception_02","I dislike these underhand tactics, but if I must ..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","They can deface the station, but they can't escape justice."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","So familiar, but so changed. They will pay for this."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","I dread to think what befell my enforcer associates..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","What must it have taken for the enforcers to abandon their posts?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","You try maintaining justice in a place like this."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Squeezed by criminals above and below. Who'd be an enforcer?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Your thoughts tell me you may not be unfamiliar with places like this, explicator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Spent time in a cell, explicator? Your thoughts suggest so..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Maybe try to think less loudly on the subject."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","It's counterproductive to bury such feelings."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","A prison seems an ironic place for criminals to hide."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Our target hides in a prison... seems like a taunt."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Look at the legs on that hab... ingenious!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","See how the hab is raised? A marvel of engineering."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","Insalubrious as it may be, isn't it impressive?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","Setting aside the smell, isn't it majestic?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","This wouldn't have been top of my list for a tour of Tertium..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","This is not the sort of filth I'm accustomed to dealing with..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","A shame to see the shops abandoned."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","I've never seen the market so quiet..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","That hab's underpinning may need maintenance..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","That hab looks awry."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_alive_01","It's working! The Smelter stirs!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_alive_02","The Machine spirit wakes!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","There is something different about this place. This is about more than tanks..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Atoman tanks are special, yes, but there must be something else about this place..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","You're talking about Moebian Steel. Please use the correct terminology..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Of course we know about Moebian Steel. Atoma is famous for it. But what else is there?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I wonder if our Tech Priest associate would tell us something about herself?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","It's beneficial for a squad to know one another. Tech Priest, would you tell us about yourself?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","I'm not sure how much we learned, but it's a start."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","The effort is appreciated, even if the content was incomprehensible."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I confess, the lack damage here makes me wonder the enemy's intent..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The manufactorum seems strangely intact..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","So, they intend to spoil the fruits of Atoma's forges."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Desecration. They will not use Atoma's own arms against her."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","We must locate the smelter."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Any intel on the smelters location?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Temperature's rising. Time to go, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_hellhole_02","If we don't move out, we're going to cook."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_lifeless_01","It is chilling to see the place so still."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_lifeless_02","I never thought I'd see these engines stilled."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","The front-gate wouldn't be my first choice..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","A frontal assault? Without backup? Why am I not surprised."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_propaganda_01","This is where the hands of the Imperium labour for all humanity."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_propaganda_02","The workers contribution to the Imperium is equal to that of any guardsman."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Incoming! Hold the line, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Hostiles sighted. Ready yourselves!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","Try not to breathe deeply..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Foundry-flavour. My favourite..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Something tells me this place is significant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","My instincts tell me there is more to this manufactorum than meets the eye..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_hack_01","Interrogation was my specialism. Admittedly of people, rather than machines."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_hack_02","Unlike those of flesh and blood, machines seldom deceive themselves."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","The heretics betray their city to live like this?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","The enemy cannot be well-resourced if they live this way..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I sense something foul nearby..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Be alert, associates. Something awful is close..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","How are we expected to operate without proper briefing?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","That oversight is a total dereliction of briefing protocol!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","We'd be better equipped to fight this daemon if we knew why it was here..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I don't understand why the daemon chose this place."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Perhaps the zealot has the right idea about heretics after all..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Then I'm inclined to agree with the zealot's approach. Let's burn them all."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Can you confirm the daemon is restricted to this area?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Please confirm the daemonic influence hasn't spread."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Then we must fight harder. It cannot prevail."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","So it violates my city further... It will burn for that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","It may be tactically advantageous to take the stairs."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Surely they cannot manipulate us using the vox?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","I cannot believe it is possible to transmit a psychic pathogen..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Watch your footing. Atoma's a long way down..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","It's not often citizens like ourselves reach such an elevated position..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I'm certain there must be a more direct route..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","It would have more efficient to air-drop us, surely?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Is this what they call fresh air? They can keep it up-spire if so."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","The air's so thin! Give me downhive fog, anyday."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","It's beautiful in the sunlight, don't you agree, associates?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Look at the view? Even you must see Tertium's beauty now."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","The doors, they're sealed!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","I fear we have been locked in!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","Locked in! This was an ambush!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","We are sealed in. A regrettable development!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Mourningstar, requesting instructions ... Curses, this vox isn't working!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","No signal from Mourningstar. We're on our own."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","My vox is dead. The heretics must be jamming the signal."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar? Mourningstar! It's no good. The vox isn't working."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","We fight on and hope for an opening."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","Disagreeable. But we are not dead yet."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","This is less than ideal. But we fight on, agreed?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","Stand ready. Let us make the heretics pay for their cleverness!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_01","Relay's here! Take out the skyfire before it does any more damage."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_02","Disarm the relay, associates, and we take out the skyfire turrets."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_district_gate_01","How many citizens are trapped behind the District Gate?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_district_gate_02","District Gate's sealed. No way out for those citizens..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","This place is symbolically important... but strategically?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","So, has the Logistratum become tactically significant?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","That would be advantageous."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Would that we  had the resource to take it now..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You're suspiciously well-acquainted with this area, explicator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Only servitors know a place like this intimately.  And you're neither, explicator..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","And that's all I want to hear about your illegal activities thank you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I'd like to know where this special-issue ammunition is being deployed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Special-issue ammo... This could give us the upper hand."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","That is rather frustrating."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Does Rannick not appreciate the importance of our duty?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","This place is too quiet."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","The entire hab block has been sealed... I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","I suppose it's a covert approach..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Perhaps this approach will teach some of you discretion..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_trains_01","At least the trains are still operational."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_rails_trains_02","The heretics have managed to keep the trains working..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Ah, I have patrolled such streets many times."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","This takes me back to better days. And worse."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Ah. This Skylink is clearly ill-maintained."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","Surely the bridge should be moving faster?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","Let us hope the name is not prophecy. I have much yet to achieve."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","I do not seek martyrdom this day. Or any day."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","A simple enough assignment, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","Done ... So long as we survive long enough."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","This could go on for some time."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","They do not seem at all disheartened, associates."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Maintain discipline! We can win this!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Keep your heads. We must work as a team!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","I see a space designated for uplifting preaching, but I shudder to think of where its occupant is now."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","The pulpit is empty. I can only hope the preacher fled in time."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","Another crime to avenge."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","These are lawless times. No one is safe."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","It may look more civilised than elsewhere, but do not be fooled."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Justice is no more commonplace here than below."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_retrieve_01","I fear we have heavy lifting ahead, colleagues."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_retrieve_02","Associates? Who wants to do the heavy lifting?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scan_01","Ensure no harm comes to the servo-skull. It is a versatile tool."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scan_02","Gathering data? [Grunt] Reminds me of the old days."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","A little Atoman sunlight will raise our spirits, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Look associates! Here's some Atoman sunlight to cheer your moods."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Even I don't recognise this place. How long has it been left this way?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","For how long has this place been lost to the city?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","It is melancholy to see the city eat itself this way..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Perhaps its time will come again."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Why are the heretics sowing plague? It must be about more than malice..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Surely our enemy could have picked one... plague or heresy? both seem overindulgent."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That sounds ominous."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","I suspected as much. There is nothing so repellent in nature..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I believe this used to be a trading port. Full of people, full of life."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","This was once a trading zone, alive with the buzz of merchant craft. All gone now."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","It can be restored. If we have the will."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","We should hope those days come again."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_interior_01","This doesn't look as stable as originally intended."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Take care, associates. Hive-quakes have destabilised this place."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","I find servitors rather reassuring. They're quietly dependable."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","Isn't it reassuring to know that after death, one's service may continue?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Here's the cargo elevator. Proceed, associates!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","We're clear to enter the cargo elevator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","This place is a tactical nightmare. And I sense, a literal one too..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","This maze is full of the stench of fear..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_approach_01","Chasm Terminus ahead."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_approach_02","This can't be the most discreet approach to the station?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","If we can't deliver justice, no one else can. We fight for Atoma."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","Try to remember protocol, but mostly, please try to stay alive."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","We shall do our duty."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Atoma requires us to succeed. We won't fail her."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Did we miss a briefing on this target?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","We surely need further intel on the target we're about to engage."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","This is strategically unsound!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","This is tactically sub-optimal!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","This looks familiar."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","Blunt instruments...  literally. Not as sophisticated as myself and my siblings."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Is this the most efficient approach?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Are these trains really so stragetically crucial?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","I admire your professionalism, but I wonder what you really think."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Useful advice, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","This covert approach isn't what I'm used to."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Enforcers are used to being visible. This feels like sneaking."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","I acknowledge, we have no choice."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Whatever it takes to free Tertium."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","I don't like this place. Feels strategically unsound."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Is this the most tactical location for the splice?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Understood."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Seems logical."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","These soldiers have numbers... but enthusiasm?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","We could have been sent livelier reinforcements..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_station_hall_01","They have bespoiled one of Tertium's jewels."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_station_hall_02","Would that you had seen this place as it was meant to be..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Look associates, fire in the south."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_station_the_bridge_02","The fight spreads. See the fire to the south?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","You'd expect the criminal life to be rather more comfortable..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Atoma's cells are more luxurious than this..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","It would be strategically inadvisable to leave the heretics here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","We can't leave the Torrent to the heretics."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","I doubt the strategic value of that approach."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","I'm not convinced you think that's the best course of action..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","What could the enforcers do about the Torrent? There's a question...."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Tertium may not care about the Torrent, but the Torrent's still part of Tertium..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","True enough."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Always the same patterns, wherever you go."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","Nice, isn't it? The locals take great pride in maintaining the statue."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","A little grand for my taste, but the citizens round here are very proud of it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","No access here."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","We'll need to find another entry point."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","Mind your footing. This place is due some maintenence."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Standard acid damage. Don't make a fuss, just watch where you walk."
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Remarkable infrastructure, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","The statistics on this place's contribution to Atoman water supplies are fascinating. Really!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","Quickly, Associates. The Atmospheric shield doesn't look well maintained."

"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_boil_a_01","You seem preoccupied of late. Yes, the rabid maniacism remains, but do I detect a note of ennui?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_boil_c_01","Perhaps I am concerned? Or perhaps I am play-acting a spark of compassion so that you can see one from the outside?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_corpse_starch_a_01","That Melk ... the insolence of him! I gave him my best smile and he just ... stared at me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_corpse_starch_c_01","Or weighing you ... after all, I'm hearing that he has a lucrative sideline in corpse starch. Just think, one day I could be the best meal you've had."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_corpse_starch_e_01","All things being equal that would be a better outcome for us both, yes."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_could_be_worse_a_01","Well, this is turning out to be another offensively miserable day."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_could_be_worse_c_01","You should never say that, Brute. Cosmic humour doesn't like you taunting it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_could_be_worse_e_01","Will you please stop saying that!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_deluded_a_01","You always seem so happy in your work. "
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_deluded_c_01","Yes ... I rather imagine that's what the heretics say about us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_deluded_e_01","Which is?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_delusion_a_01","You are wearing that most disagreeable expression again. It's not like you to be downhearted. I think I like it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_delusion_c_01","Yes, I think I know the one you mean. Don't worry, she is delusional."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_delusion_e_01","Oh, I didn't say that. I just said she was delusional. I think you will make an absolutely charming couple."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_delusion_g_01","Yes. I know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_drowned_b_01","And what, pray, happened to the good confessor?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_drowned_d_01","In glory?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_drowned_f_01","Splendid. I feel so very uplifted."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_endeared_b_01","Hah! If that isn't the char-stove calling the cauldron black!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_endeared_d_01","I'm sorry ... I'm sure I never used to overreact like this."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_entrails_a_01","Ugh. I can just about cope with the screams, but the blood? The entrails? I'm going to smell like an abatoir for days."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_entrails_c_01","I really hope that is a figure of speech."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_entrails_e_01","Well, it could do with a wash ... and so could I."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fail_b_01","Try not to dwell on it - you're not going to fail."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fail_d_01","Because then I'll have failed too and we'll both be corpse starch in the morning. That's the kind of unity I can well do without."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fun_b_01","Firstly, I am keeping up, thank you very much. And second, if all this is ""fun"" then I am happy to miss it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fun_d_01","Ah yes. An excellent point. We should hurry. And faster ... NOW!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_genius_b_01","Ah well, it is the burden of genius to be forever misunderstood."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_genius_d_01","Alas, perhaps you haven't. Perhaps neither of us have."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_gnomic_a_01","I simply do not understand why you are always so cheerful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_gnomic_c_01","So you admit you've nothing to be cheerful about?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hobby_a_01","Did you see that last heretic? Raving and screaming all the time. Most distressing for those of us with finer feelings."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hobby_c_01","What? A fellow has to have hobbies, does he not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_honourary_a_01","I envy you, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_honourary_c_01","And that is why I envy you. You're so very happy in your delusions. It must be comforting."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_idiots_b_01","I agree Sibling. Blockheads, every last one."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_idiots_d_01","Oh well, at least we have each other."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_jumble_b_01","Yes, I had noticed much the same. Her present is entangled with the shadows of her past. Fascinating."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_jumble_d_01","Or stronger. It depends on where the truth lies. But I suppose time will tell."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_killing_spikeys_b_01","Oh yes? And how do you calculate that, precisely?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_killing_spikeys_d_01","Yes ... Yes you do. Of course, you love killing everything."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lice_b_01","How ridiculous! Such an operative would never allow himself to be seen ... although it would explain the itchy feeling between my shoulder blades."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lice_d_01","[Sigh] One cannot argue with the voice of experience."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loom_shadow_a_01","Must you loom so much? I can barely see anything in your shadow."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loom_shadow_c_01","A ... most compelling argument. On the other hand, I too am in your shadow and am most assuredly not dead."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loom_shadow_e_01","Is that a threat?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_loom_shadow_g_01","Ah."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mood_a_01","You know ... it wouldn't hurt you to lighten up a little?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mood_c_01","Yes ... but these would be other Zealots, is that so?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mystery_b_01","Inquisitors do not simply die, Brute. They fade into mystery. At least, that's what Zola would have you believe."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mystery_d_01","Alas, the best you and I can hope for is to splat into oblivion. I only hope that it proves terribly inconvenient for all concerned."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pray_with_zola_a_01","Have you noticed anything unusual about Zola lately?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pray_with_zola_c_01","I do not do that! ... At least, not if anyone's asking. Let us simply say that she seems even more on edge than normal. If that's possible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pray_with_zola_e_01","Perhaps. One way or another, she's bound to feel better afterwards."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pressure_b_01","Oh no. A compliment. This can only lead to bad things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pressure_d_01","Because it always does! I might be expected to offer you one in return, for example. It's very pressuring."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pressure_f_01","Yes, I suppose it is."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_psychotic_b_01","Spoken like a true psychotic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_psychotic_d_01","I never said I wasn't a psychotic! But you, my friend, leave me in the dust. It's ... unsettling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_puppet_show_b_01","And where else would I be? It's not as though I can simply leave."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_puppet_show_d_01","And do corpses talk much where you're from, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_puppet_show_f_01","The mind boggles and the soul recoils ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_quiet_b_01","You would think better if you talked less, and so would I."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_quiet_d_01","And what does ""real"" mean in this particular case?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_really_puny_b_01","And you're stupid!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_really_puny_d_01","And you're ... Oh, honestly what is the point?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sealed_b_01","You're bored? So it is possible to have too much of a good thing after all?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sealed_d_01","Yes you were ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sealed_f_01","Oh, my lips are sealed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_showman_a_01","Do pick up your feet properly, my dear Brute. You're letting the side down. Grace. Comportment! Dignity!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_showman_c_01","I know, but a little style is the only freedom we are permitted. Embrace it! Unleash your inner showman."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sunshine_a_01","Take it from me, there is no point dwelling on the past."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sunshine_c_01","True, but even when we feel as though we are in control, we are not. Just puppets of an embittered universe."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_syllables_a_01","I am starting to suspect that beneath your crude, lumpish exterior there beats the heart of a true psychopath!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_syllables_c_01","I refer to your heart, dear Brute. Would you have believed it capable of something worthy of three syllables?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_taunting_a_01","The more we converse, the less I am certain whether you are an imbecile or merely taunting me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_taunting_c_01","You see? There you go again!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tears_a_01","I'm curious ... do you smile at anything other than slaughter?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tears_c_01","Just one tear?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_the_best_b_01","Ogryns are certainly the loudest. "
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_the_best_d_01","I can see where this is going and I refuse to play your game."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_thinking_a_01","I was thinking--"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_thinking_c_01","Yes, thank you Brute ... So anyway, I was thinking--"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_thinking_e_01","And now I've completely lost my thread. Marvellous."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_topsy_b_01","Really? Well do keep those updates coming."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_topsy_d_01","I ... and I cannot believe I'm saying this ... cannot take issue with that statement."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_topsy_f_01","I know. The whole world's gone topsy-turvey."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_topsy_h_01","Ach, it's not your fault."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trudge_b_01","Even if there was, Morrow would make us trudge through the filth anyway. "
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_trudge_d_01","I don't think it's that. I think the filth reminds him of home. "
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_truth_b_01","Someone's ear to the ground anyway. Who's to say if he is the original owner?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_truth_d_01","Whether any of it be true?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_veil_a_01","Take my advice: if Melk offers you a little snack from under his desk? Refuse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_veil_c_01","Yes ... And then there's the fact that I found some kind of body-piercing in mine. I prefer to keep my veil of ignorance firmly in place."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_victory_b_01","Absolutely. [Sotto] For someone, anyway."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_victory_d_01","Really? Never mind, I'm sure your corpse Emperor did."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_in_my_head_b_01","I am something of an outlier, it is true. I have spent some considerable time in your company and yet remain unmurdered. "
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_in_my_head_d_01","So we both kill at the whims of the voices in our heads? Splendid. I finally feel like we have something in common."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_optimist_b_01","This one isn't exactly in splendid shape ... or had you not noticed?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_optimist_d_01","How strange ... I never took you for an optimist. Then again, repeated blows to the head can work miracles."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_broken_a_01","If you clutch that weapon any tighter it's liable to break."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_broken_c_01","I stand corrected. The weapon is safe, but you snapped long ago."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_broken_e_01","Yes ... That's part of it. You can't break something that's already broken, after all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_deeds_b_01","Why thank you, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_deeds_d_01","I'm sure we'll have a simply splendid time."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_familiar_a_01","Sibling, it concerns me that you are growing too familiar with some of the Blunts."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_familiar_c_01","Not so loud ... You know how skittish they get."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_head_down_b_01","Oh yes, why didn't I think of that? What do you imagine I've been trying to do?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_head_down_d_01","At least mine haven't all slipped their leashes and run off screaming into the night!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_intellect_b_01","Tut, tut, tut, Sibling. I think you mean ""with whom I can converse""."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_intellect_d_01","Harsh, very harsh."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_lecture_a_01","Oh Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_lecture_c_01","I was merely going to congratulate you on your last kill, but if you're going to be like that ... ?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_lecture_e_01","Insignificant? Outmoded? ... Inconsequential, perhaps? No ... trivial."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nasty_a_01","Are you thinking nasty thoughts about me again?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nasty_c_01","Maybe. Maybe I'm just testing you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nasty_e_01","This is a boring game."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_nasty_g_01","How dare you!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_polish_a_01","Your attitude leaves much to be desired."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_polish_c_01","I find that I am little surprised."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_polish_e_01","You are truly an inspiration."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_03_b_01","Ah, but Zealots also cannot be trusted, for their minds drifteth upon a sea of delusion and temptation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_03_d_01","You started it. Just because you did so before I spoke them is irrelevent."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_05_b_01","Yes, I know. You tell me every few hours. Where's the variety? That's what I want to know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_05_d_01","How insightful. I am overcome."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_puny_b_01","I ... think so. Why do you ask?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_puny_d_01","You always say that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_runt_a_01","You really are the most oafish of imbeciles, you know that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_runt_c_01","Now that's really very unkind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_runt_e_01","I did not! ... Oh wait, maybe I did."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_scars_a_01","I confess, I do like working with you, Roughneck. You're more professional than the others."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_scars_c_01","So would you say you were indoctinated?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_scars_e_01","Well as philosophies go, I suppose yours has the benefit of concision."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_words_a_01","I must say, you are are very loqacious for an Ogryn ... That means you talk a lot, by the way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_words_c_01","I'm not sure it will. This would be a word someone else taught you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_words_e_01","I'm not sure she meant it, my dear Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_words_g_01","Yes, I'm sure you're correct."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_sanity_b_01","I wouldn't worry about it, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_sanity_d_01","No, I said I wouldn't worry about it. I never do. [Mad Laughter]"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_trains_a_01","I have told you Brute, again and again ... We are not getting on the train!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__bonding_conversation_trains_c_01","You are starting to give me a headache with all the shouting. Why are you shouting?"

"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_hound_b_02","One slavering beast and ... Well, I suppose I should make that two slavering beasts."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_01","I don't like it at all. There could be anything waiting out there."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_02","I'm sure there's nothing horrible waiting in the fog. Hah! I wish."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_a_01","Well, I hope you didn't want to see the enemy coming."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_a_02","This is fun! Assuming you didn't want to see our foes until it's too late!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_a_01","I don't want a single slavering Hound anywhere near me. Do you understand?"

"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_01","Oh, toughen up won't you? It's me that needs protecting!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_02","Ignore them. I'm the one you should be defending."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_01","Careful Sibling. We wouldn't want to think you had a negative attitude."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_02","I don't like it either, but we're here now. We should watch each other's backs."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_01","For once, I agree. Perhaps we can use one of the others as a distraction?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_02","Indeed. I fear that our luck is growing ever more sour. Given where it started, that's not good at all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_01","I think I'll just hide behind you, if it's all the same?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_02","But I don't want to be close to the heretics! Or any of you, for that matter!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_01","We are all of us misused. Alas that it does not give common cause."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_02","Ah! Is that the rank stench of hypocrisy? I think it might be."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_01","Oh, I'm sure we're all dying as we speak. So long as I outlast you, I am content."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_02","Are you scared, Fanatic? Is some strange human emotion other than rage trying to claw to the surface?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_02_b_01","Succinctly put, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_03_b_01","A limited way of looking at the world, but I suppose the only one you have."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_05_b_01","I'm very glad to hear it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_13_b_01","Everything smells liked death around here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_17_b_01","Oh yes, you are a monster. But then, so am I."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_19_b_01","Oh, I'm sure you'll work it out."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_03_b_01","How eloquent! Do I recognise the teachings of Helbrandt Tancredi? You're wider read than I thought."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_06_b_01","I'm sure you'll get the chance."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_11_b_01","Their judgement is somewhat sub-par, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_12_b_01","They lied. They always lie. Then they kill you for spurious reasons."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_15_b_01","That's the spirit! Rebel! Throw off your shackles! I will watch your career with interest."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_18_b_01","Why, of course you do. It's less confusing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_03_b_01","Be thankful you lack the imagination to guess what's coming."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_06_b_01","How wonderful. The Brute coughs up hairballs now, like a giant gyrinx."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_11_b_01","I suppose you do have more weight to carry."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_12_b_01","Please leave the prometheum tanks alone. I remember last time..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_15_b_01","How liberating it must be to never dream of... more."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_18_b_01","I could root around in your head and bring a little order... But it's beneath me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_01_a_01","Are we not done yet?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_01_b_01","Apparently not. I blame management."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_02_a_01","I was meant for better than this."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_03_a_01","Reduced to a mere ""soldier"". Well, I suppose it could be worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_04_a_01","It makes a pleasant change to be the hunter, rather than to be fleeing witchseekers."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_04_b_01","Doesn't it just? It's really rather cathartic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_05_a_01","Remember: we have value only so long as we remain useful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_06_a_01","Even at its best, the Imperium is a grimy place. Now? Well ... just look at it all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_a_01","In the distance ... a thousand souls ... screaming ... The war does not go well."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_08_a_01","I know none of you trust me. Perhaps you're right."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_08_b_01","Oh, don't talk like that, Sibling. Of course I'm right."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_09_a_01","I see how you all regard me. As if I'm something inhuman. Well, I'm glad to be so."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_09_b_01","I agree. ""Human"" is so limiting."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_10_a_01","Would you believe this is actually more pleasant than much of my recent life?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_a_01","Combat is so ... uncomplicated. I actually find it soothing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_12_a_01","I think I prefer it when they try to swarm us. At least then I know where they are."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_13_a_01","This isn't over. Then again, when is anything truly over?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_14_a_01","This is a waste of my unparalleled mind. Morrow should have sent a blunt."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_15_a_01","By the Five Rusting Spires ... I'm so very, very bored."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_15_b_01","Aren't we all? Complaining doesn't help anything."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_16_a_01","Ah ... A brief moment of relative quiet. And ... breathe ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_17_a_01","Feeling ... dizzy. I'm not used to all this running around."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_18_a_01","Remain alert, simpletons. I do not wish to die because you keep poor watch!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_19_a_01","Go here, go there, do that. What am I? A performing hound?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_19_b_01","We all dance for the Emperor's enjoyment ... I thought you knew that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_20_a_01","If you think the heretics' words are bad, you should hear their thoughts!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_01_b_01","Nobody cares, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_04_b_01","Too much longer, in my experience."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_08_b_01","Even your imaginary friend has stopped talking to you? How sad."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_09_b_01","Perhaps you could ask him to speak loud enough for us all to hear?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_15_b_01","If only their screams weren't so distressing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_19_b_01","It's very liberating, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_b_01","Ah, yes. The joy of being a human bioscanner for an uncaring master."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_08_b_01","Spoken like one who has neither known nor desired freedom."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_09_b_01","Oh… You think I fight with you cretins out of trust? How precious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_b_01","Then I am thankful not to be a citizen of Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_19_b_01","[Sigh] I suppose I shall just have to rely on superior intellect and raw power."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_01_b_01","Those who have no choice. There is no shortage of such folk."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_08_b_01","What a splendid martinet you are."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_09_b_01","It's not exactly to my taste either."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_15_b_01","Forgive me ... but surely if you'd lasted in the Guard, you'd not be here?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_19_b_01","Perhaps if you stood still you wouldn't keep straying into our shots, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_01_b_01","I'm not sure you know what ""glorious"" means."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_08_b_01","Indeed. They are rather ... single-minded."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_09_b_01","I'm not sure that now is a good time."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_15_b_01","This is as nothing to the horrors of the unfettered Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_19_b_01","I suppose there's something to be said for the direct approach."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_01_b_01","Quite the little ray of sunshine, aren't we?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_08_b_01","Alas, you missed ""profound"" by this much."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_b_01","Glory in victory, malice in defeat? I like the way you think, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_15_b_01","How do you know that? Could it be that you're [Gasp] a filthy psyker too?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_19_b_01","Enough with the Cadian poetry already ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_01_b_01","Shadows hide many things. Closed minds hide more."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_04_b_01","That's an ... intangible commodity at best."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_08_b_01","You're entitled to your opinion, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_09_b_01","""Justice"" is not a virtue in great supply hereabouts, alas."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_15_b_01","Personally I smite them thus because I don't wish to be smitten in return."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_19_b_01","You certainly make up any lack I might have in those areas, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_01_b_01","If it lies to hand, why not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_04_b_01","Yes ... I can well imagine why you'd say that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_08_b_01","Well ... I mean ... That's just basic common sense, surely?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_09_b_01","Indeed. I will settle for a passing grade."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_15_b_01","Yes, yes, yes. But does it have to be the only reward?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_19_b_01","Which by my reckoning suggests that things can only get worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_b_01","Follow me, if you wish, though I fancy you will not like where I lead."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_b_01","No. You merely fear that which you cannot understand."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_07_b_01","If only you could read my thoughts, as I can yours, you'd say the same about me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_08_b_01","If I am to die today, it'll likely be through your superstitious idiocy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_14_b_01","You suppose yourself a guiding light, yet you have neither radiance, nor eyes to see."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_18_b_01","In my experience, prayers to your carrion lord presage only discomfort."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Will this mission never end?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_02","I tire of all this traipsing around."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_03","We are being watched, cretins!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_04","The heretics are merely biding their time!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_05","More heretics approach. I can feel them!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Untidy minds surround us!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_07","Be watchful, cretins! We are not alone."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_08","My incomparable mind tires of this drudgery."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_09","One can grow tired of slaughter."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_10","This is not how I saw the day proceeding ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","The ignorant like to give little labels to those who are special. It makes them feel superior."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","Do not worry about it, Brute. These are nought but labels given to the gifted by the unimaginative."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","What does it matter, so long as the foe is slain?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","You worry about the strangest things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","If only there we another, obvious explanation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","You do know you can take your finger off the trigger?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Cretin! Don't use all the ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","I need ammunition too, you know!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Will you stop stealing all the ammunition?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","Oh. My sincere apologies."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Well, I'm told."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Such a revelation! Also, orks are green."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","You have fearful temper? Imagine my surprise."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_a_01","I confess, I have a bad feeling about this mission."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_a_02","I am struck by a sudden sense of foreboding ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_a_03","I sense trouble ahead ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Yes. This mission has ""disaster"" written all over it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","I concur. Then again, everything's ominous around here ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","Yes. What possible harm can come from putting a machine in your brain?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","You'd merely go from being a fleshy lump to being a cyborg lump. A lump, you would remain."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Quick! Someone find something shiny to distract him."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Is there room for boredom in that tiny brain?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Ah. No sense. No feeling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","I fear your pain receptors are overwhelmed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","I do find cheery imbeciles wearying."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","You are happy in your work are you not, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","Personally I would not sully my hands on these pustulent heretics. But then, I don't have to."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","Glad to hear it, Brute. You get your hands dirty so I do not have to."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_a_01","Is anyone else cold? It's always cold."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_a_02","It is always freezing, wherever we go!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_a_03","Why is it always so cold in this wretched place?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","I'm glad I'm not the only one."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","You too, Sibling? So I'm not mad. At least not about that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","There's no need to show off!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Yes, yes, yes. Very impressive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","They are but two heads of the same aquila, and our kind owe them nothing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Blunt instruments both, and no friends of our kind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","I can understand them choosing me for a suicide mission, but you too? That must be galling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","Oh, wonderful. My fate is in the hands of a fatalistic oaf."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Oh, just tell them to go away."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Threaten to devour them. That always works."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","It would not surprise me to learn he is an invention, designed to inspire more of your kind to obedience."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Hero-worship is a dangerous thing. You aspire to servitude, and forget to live."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","Take, take, take, take ... What about a ""thank you""?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","I am not expendable, thank you very much."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","You can run, but you can't escape."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","You should try it. Truly. It'll be educational."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Turning a blind eye is what the authorities do best."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","And why should they care for this world? It is easily replaced."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","I feel you have rather misjudged our relationship."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","If I agree, will you be quiet?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_a_01","I must say, I don't understand your fascination with grenades. Clumsy things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_a_02","Grenades are loud, smelly and crude. Much like some of you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_a_03","Grenades are the perfect tool for a blunt, unrefined and inefficient."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","Agreed, Sibling. But what are we to do?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Alas, sometimes they are necessary."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","If you think things are only just getting bad, you haven't been paying attention."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Ah yes, we must always meet violence with more violence. The way of the Imperium."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","What if none of us are dreaming? Did you consider that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Maybe we're all dreaming each other?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Liquor is a crutch. Have care you do not lean too hard upon it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","And all this time I believed you were drunk on fervour alone..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","Yours is a special kind of insanity."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","I wondered if you were delusional. Now I know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","Impossible to say. Rannick keeps us in the dark."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Perhaps. The cost to innocents will be formidable either way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","Well, at least you won't be bored."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","I know. Tragic. What we were talking about?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","Such is the nature of humanity, I fear."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Control the conflict and you control the population. The tyrant's tool never goes out of style."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_a_01","You do know we're all expendable?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_a_02","Our lives mean nothing to Morrow and the others, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_a_03","This is most untenable. We are an expendable resource to the others."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","I have grown used to such treatment."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","If it helps, Morrow is no safer than we. The Imperium is built on loyal corpses."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","The Brute feels something? It will think something next."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Oh, tell us all about it, do."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","And if one doesn't care for the smell of burning flesh?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Yes, I can see why you like it. It's the subtlety, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","But at least you're good company. Unlike some I might mention."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Just kill the heretics, Brute. You're good at that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","You're in a strange mood, Sibling. Perhaps some ... medication?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","I know. That's what I've been saying this whole time!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Such a sentimental heart you are ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","You are certainly ... memorable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Please be sure to stand downwind of me for the remainder of the day."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Sometimes, Brute, I wonder if you aren't your own worst enemy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_a_01","Poxwalkers. Always Poxwalkers. I hate them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_a_02","Why must there be so many Poxwalkers? Foul things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_a_03","I do not care for these Poxwalkers. Their thoughts are... unsettling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","Yes. Buzz, buzz, buzzing thoughts. Distant screams. Horrible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","I quite agree. We should kill them quicker."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Oh yes. That scratch looked very painful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Was that a troublesome little bruise, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","Don't waste the medicae! Honestly!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","It hurt. I don't like things that hurt."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","If you wanted it, you should have been quicker."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","I'm afraid we're here for the duration, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","I don't see leave being granted any time soon ... If at all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","I never thought I believed in purgatory, yet here we are."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","Have you ever considered using your inside voice for a change?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Can we not simply enjoy the quiet?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","You really are a simple soul, are you not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","Please! Can you not keep it down?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","You don't speak for all of us, you know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","You could scarcely do a worse job. Then again, the bar is very low."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Why not? Can things really get worse?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","Toil, ingenuity, artistry... All merely mechanisms of control by Imperial bureaucracy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Sweet sibling, are you really so easily distracted by shiny things while ignoring the horror around you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","Such arrogance to think yourself the only one who's really here. I like it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Aren't you delightfully delusional?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","That sounds very tiring."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","What a complicated creature you are ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","Funny, isn't it, how the likes of Messelina are abominations when living, but blessed saints posthumously."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","I hear Messelina was put to death by the very creed who now venerate her. Funny how that works."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_a_01","You really should all be nicer to me. I have feelings, you know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_a_02","Would it hurt any of you to offer a kind word from time to time?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_a_03","I wish you'd all stop looking at me as if I might turn psychotic at any point."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","I know! I feel much the same!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","You are not alone, Sibling. Alas, alas, alas."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","Alas, I shed no tears for lifeless stone."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Things before people. A less than admirable attitude."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","Oh no ... Not this again."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","That strikes me as a very, very bad idea."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","I sense a troubled mind..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","You are distressed, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","So glad I was thrown into the fires of battle, only to claim my reward in death."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","I wouldn’t be so sure. I still hear the screams of those who have gone before."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","I was thankful for a moment's peace and quiet, but you ruined it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","You expect me to be thankful? For… this?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","You really need a hobby, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","To what purpose, hmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","I believe it is something do with relative gravities, but doubtless you wouldn't understand."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Inadvertent genetic deviance, Brute. ""Deviance"" is such a splendid word."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","You do know they're probably made from people?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Yes. Cannibalism in a shiny shrink-wrapped packet. Delectable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_a_01","You should think more kindly of me, you know. I might be listening."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_a_02","I can hear someone thinking nasty thoughts about me. Again."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_a_03","You should be more careful with those stray thoughts. I might get offended."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Maybe I just made you think that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","See how easily you are deceived by an incomparable mind?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","My dear Brute, you're all cretins to me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","There is no shame in being lesser than I. After all, my mind is incomparable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","It makes for an interesting story."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","What an imagination you have!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","Alas, that this fine Imperium finds no value in recuperation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","I think rather we will be sent into the fray until the enemy kill us, or we expire from exhaustion."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","I'd really rather not."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","I think it's noisy enough already, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","I seldom notice the difference, sleeping or awake."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","That's what you get for gorging yourself."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","From the size of the rifle you know they're ... overcompensating."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Big gun. Small brain. It was ever thus."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","You're so ... exhausting."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Run here, kill that, praise the Emperor ... How tiring."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_a_01","Perhaps we should try being stealthy? If only for the change of pace."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_a_02","I confess I would prefer to sneak around, rather than engage in head-on confrontation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_a_03","Why must we always charging screaming at the foe? We should employ stealth."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Can you even see who you're addressing? You ask for miracles."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","Lower your expectations, Sibling. Lower them all the way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","Well, don't look at me. I bathe."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","What a thing to say. I am appalled."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Well, that seals Atoma's fate."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","Oh, what can possibly go wrong?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","All I see is a squalid city of despair; a beacon of darkness and human suffering."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","Sibling, what have they done to you? Are you really so blind?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","I am quite comfortable at a distance, thank you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","And what's next? Hugs? Cheery singalongs? I think I shall abstain."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","Yes ... They are oddly pitiable, are they not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","They are screaming children, so desperate for attention they care not whence it comes."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","I suspect we are all equally innocent."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","You are blameless? Me too. What a coincidence."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","Quite the little entrepreneur, aren't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","The gleam in your eyes as you said that... Like a giddy child."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","Such paranoia must be comforting. If you think they're out to get you, you must actually think you matter."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","Present company excepted, I presume? No? How very predictable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","If I were to look into your thoughts, I wonder if I'd find a mind free of sin?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","You sound very confident in your own purity. What would I find if I poked around in your mind, I wonder?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","You speak as if I intended otherwise."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","A palpable hit. How can I survive such wicked words?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","You actually sound as though you believe that. Curious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","Well ... Who am I to argue with such a well-reasoned case?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Oh, another tyrant. Just what the galaxy needed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","Oh, don't you sound important? I'm quaking in my boots."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","Were I to unburden my darkest thoughts, your tiny mind might explode. Literally."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","My only failing is finding myself here, in the company of such pious cretins."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Well ... that's me told ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","I think you might be hallucinating."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","I suppose you want sympathy?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","Hah! The fearless crusader in the bruised flesh, yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_01","Where are you going?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_02","Yes, I'm sure there's something fascinating over there…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_03","Don't go wandering!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_04","Stay with the group!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_05","For pity's sake, stay with the group!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_06","Fine! Leave! See if I care!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_07","If you're one your own, you're on your own!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_08","You think it's safe to be alone, do you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_09","You should probably come back."
"loc_psyker_male_a__come_back_to_squad_10","Oh no. Please don't leave."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","Surely one of the Inquisitor's influence can do better than this sorry band? Myself excepted, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","Perfect. I should have let the witchseekers take me. It'd have been quicker."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","I heard some of the ... menials whispering about the 'Cicatrix Maledictum'. This is new to me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","Lovely. So long as it stays away from here, it's not my problem."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","Is there any hope for this place? Not that I care. I'm simply curious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","I really don't understand the attraction of this place. It's a cage. Nothing more."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","Atoma's second hive city ... it isn't lost. I sense its occupants. Why does everyone pretend it is forsaken?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","It will not die! Fight harder!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Simpletons, do you not see it is weaker behind?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","I sense it is weak behind. Maybe try that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","Nag, nag, nag ... Oh, very well."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Oh, aren't you masterful? ... But it is a good idea."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","The explicator is a ... curious woman."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","What do we think about our gallant explicator?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","Her mind is a series of closed boxes, one inside the other."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She has formidable mental discipline. Not that I've tested it, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","I shall trust her so long as I can see her."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","I haven't survived this long by trusting her sort."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Common rumour claims Zola was whelped on the very world for which we fight."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","I heard a curious thing ... Explicator Zola hails from Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Doesn't sound like information she'd care to have bandied around."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Better she doesn't hear you've been prying, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Oh, fabulous. A flying zealot. Just what we needed..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Because a zealot with wings is exactly what we need..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Are you really so credulous?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","She saw you coming, didn't she?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","The pilot is a wild soul. I don't know if that's good or bad."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","Our pilot is the only one around here who seems truly alive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","Her spirit is unruly. Much like her manner."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","She has an untidy mind. Like a box of wrenches upturned and badly repacked."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Thank you, that's very reassuring I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Oh? Well that's alright then. Blockhead."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_01","Well, that was certainly an interesting sight ... You'll not believe me, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_02","Well, I didn't expect to see that ... though I'm certain you'll not find it credible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_03","I can scarcely credit what I witnessed earlier. You certainly won't."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_01_04","Such a sight you missed earlier! Your imaginations surely won't stretch to encompass it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","And yet I sense you're going to keep talking anyway ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Then you can save us all the effort of listening, perhaps?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_01","Our pilot struck the quartermaster cold. It was ... oddly enjoyable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_02","Our pilot downed the quartermaster with a single punch. I confess ... I smiled."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_03","The quartermaster started a fight with our pilot, and regretted it at once."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_03_04","It was a brawl between our pilot and the quartermaster. Well, not a brawl. More a trouncing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","Glorious! If only I'd seen it!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Brunt had it coming. He's a turgid brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_01","It was poetry. Sheer poetry, I tell you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_02","One punch, and he dropped. Delightful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_03","It took a substantial bribe on my part, but it was more than worth it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_05_04","It was worth everything I paid her, and more. Hah!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","I sense a troubled spirit ... And it's written all over your face."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","I sense you're troubled ... Why is that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Gambling is the entertainment of imbeciles ... as you constantly prove."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","A fool is easily swindled, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Its flesh is thicker than you are!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","Bad enough that it's ugly, but now it won't die!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Aim for the head! Isn't it obvious?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Shoot at the head, simpletons! Must I do all your thinking?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Well, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","I mean ... That's basically obvious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_01","Morrow mourns lost comrades. So I'm told ... I'd never spy on anyone's thoughts like that, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_02","Morrow looks at us, but he sees old comrades."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_03","Morrow's past is a burden on him. It should be plain even to you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_01_04","Morrow is mired in the past, I deem. Old voices and old faces."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","So I've noted. But I can't say that I care."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","Again, an assumption of interest on my part. You should look to that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","Morrow will endure, or he won't. That's his problem."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","Morrow knows nothing of suffering. No blunt ever truly does."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","That sergeant! Good manners cost nothing! Hah!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","Our sergeant sets new standards for uncouthness with every passing day."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Yes. Beneath that surly exterior beats the heart of true psychopath."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","Oh? The gruff brute hardened by a lifetime of bullying lacks social graces? Do tell."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","He's a brute, and a blockhead. That's all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Did I say I wished to understand him?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","I think you overestimate my interest. Considerably."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","I'm supposed to care about that, I assume? Give a response to validate your existence?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","I'll have nightmares for days. Thank you very much. You believe Morrow was working for the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","I see. And Morrow was working for the Inquisitor even then?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow carries himself like an old man."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Sergeant-Major Morrow has an older soul than he should."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","If he became lost during a Warp flight, many things are possible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Many souls become lost on the tides of the Immaterium. Oh yes."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","How do you find Hadron-- I mean, the Tech-Priest?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","I do find the Tech-Priest rather curious, I must admit."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","Truthfully, there is no other aboard this vessel to match my intellect."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","Does her genius intimidate you, perhaps?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","I like her ... Though I'm sure my opinion is of little account."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","I find it's better to keep an open mind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","You actually sound like you enjoy it. Imagine that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","You don't have to sound so eager. You're giving me a headache."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","Yes. The torture. The privation. The oppression. It just screams 'love' does it not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","Oh don't worry. I'm not about to forget all your precious Emperor has 'given' me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Did anyone else hear that strange noise?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","I see you understand the concept of language. The application, however ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_01","I need covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_02","I need covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_04","Cover me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_05","I insist you cover me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_06","Cover me! At once!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_07","I must have covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_08","Covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_09","Can I trouble you for covering fire?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cover_me_10","Covering fire! If it's not too much trouble!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_01","Losing too much blood…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_02","Wounds… too deep…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_03","Oh… That definitely hurts…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_04","Head… ringing…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_05","Must fight on… Show them all…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_06","Keep fighting…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_07","The pain. The terrible pain."
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_08","Oh, my agony…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_09","I hear the dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__critical_health_10","The dead are singing to me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_psyker_male_a__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_psyker_male_a__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Get off, beast!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Stop biting me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","Help! Help!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","The Hound has me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_06","Get this Hound off!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_07","Aaaargh!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_08","Help! Someone help!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","Go away, Hound!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","Begone, beast!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_01","Trapped!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_02","I cannot escape!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_03","I cannot move!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_04","I am trapped!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_05","Someone! Get me free!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_06","Free me! At once!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_07","Set me free!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_08","I can't get free!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_09","Help! Help! Get me free!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__disabled_by_enemy_10","Cannot escape!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_01","The Rager's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_02","The Rager's no longer a problem!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_03","That's the Rager attended to!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_04","We've killed the Rager!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_05","That's the end of the Rager!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_06","That's better. So much calmer."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_07","Ah. Tranquility comes a step closer."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_08","Rager's dead. I prefer his mind that way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_09","That's better. No more angry thoughts."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_10","That's quite enough out of you, Rager!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_01_d_01","Yes ... empathy is always dangerous."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_02_d_01","You're welcome to it. So very barbaric."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_05_e_01","Yes, one of the many benefits of being a corpse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_01","The Hound's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_02","The Dog's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_03","The Hound's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_04","The Hound's gone!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_05","We've killed the Hound!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_06","Hound slaughtered."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_07","We slaughtered the Hound!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_08","That's the Hound dead."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_09","Hound's out of its misery."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_10","Hound's no longer a problem."
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_01","The Daemonhost's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_02","The Daemonhost's gone!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_03","We killed the Daemonhost!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_04","The Daemonhost is banished!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_05","Daemonhost banished!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__enemy_kill_daemonhost_06","Be at peace."

Forced to sell my incomparable skills to smugglers, hive gangers, bounty hunters and all their blockheaded ilk merely to survive.  Alas, such has always been the way for my kind. If we are not slain out of hand, dissected, drafted, or dragged aboard unmarked vessels never to be seen again..."

"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_b_01","Is skill at arms the only quality you require from a comrade? Because the Homo Sapiens Minimus have few other redeeming features."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_b_02","It is the only redeeming quality of the Homo Sapiens Minimus. Their wayward proclivities are well documented."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_one_c_01","Black marketeers, fences, thieves... even cutthroats. Yes, I think a Ratling would fit right in here."

"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_a_03","I often think of the lot of abhumans. Tolerated for as long as they prove useful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_a_04","Pity the abhuman: persecuted, used and abused by a cruel Administratum."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_b_01","Acceptance is not exactly a common creed, or had you not noticed?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_b_02","Yes, indifference and cruelty on every hand. Why does it surprise you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","Many risk reclassification as true mutants. Then, I fear, their days are numbered."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","The abhuman stands always close to the brink of mutation. Should they be reclassified, nothing will save them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_two_c_01","Are not Navigators abhuman? Would you say men and women of such import are soulless? Interesting..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","If abhumans are soulless, then psykers must be too. And yet the Imperium requires them for Soul-Binding. Curious..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","And how would you propose tanks manoeuvre on the paths we must take? Let me guess: you haven't thought it through."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","Problem with tanks is the collateral damage. Problem with collateral damage is that it's usually us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","Like attracts like. Amass armoured divisions here, and we'll yet have another Armageddon on our hands."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","Grunts and their toys... Did you learn nothing from Armageddon? I'd rather not be embroiled in a war of that magnitude."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","Oh, to be a tiny, insignificant and largely disposable cog in an enormous, unforgiving machine. What joy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","Look on the bright side, Roughneck. With greater responsibility comes a greater chance of dying a hideous death, alone."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","I believe we're likened to a precise, surgical implement. The Astra Militarum is more of a... great big thunderhammer."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","Much of our work is done in the shadows. Difficult, when you have a thousand cretins shouting battlecries behind you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_01","I sometimes think the common soldier has an easier life than the average psyker. But then I remember that Commissars exist."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_02","Commissars are cold-hearted wretches. Empty minds, too. Nothing but judgement and brutality."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_03","I pity any Militarum soldier who ever crossed paths with a heartless Commissar."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_04","I've met Witch-Hunters with more empathy than the average Militarum Commissar. Wretched creatures!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Mutiny against them is surprisingly rare. I suppose fear is a heady drug."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","They're testament to the limits of the human mind. Broken and rebuilt until their humanity has left them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Orphans all. Indoctrinated by the Drill Abbots of the Schola Progenium, and transformed into brutal taskmasters."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Tragic, really. They are indoctrinated from an early age to believe pain is an illusion, and disobedience is heresy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","Ah yes, it beggars belief how a man might remember which way to point a lasgun without a catechism ringing in his ears."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","What was it now...? Faith in the Emperor guarantees victory, but death in his service is its own reward. I'm sure it's one or the other."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","They peddle both hope and fear in equal measure; explaining to ignorance the nature of the unknowable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","I suppose it's better that they're hunting aliens out there than burning witches down here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_four_b_01","You don't say, Brute? I had no idea."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_four_b_02","In other news, blood is hard to launder out of uniforms."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_four_c_01","I prefer to keep my feet on solid ground."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_four_c_02","If I must fight, I would rather do so unreliant on artificial atmosphere."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_one_b_01","Rogue Traders are free spirits. Being shackled to this war probably doesn't suit her."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_one_b_02","I suspect she'd be happier on the frontier, trading and swindling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Cautious respect is due here, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_one_c_02","A little respect is appropriate in her case, I suggest."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_a_01","As I understand it, Shipmistress Brahms ensures Grendyl's agents are where he needs them, and when."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_a_02","A shame, really, to see so noble a house as the shipmistress' reduced to ferrying Grendyl's operatives."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_a_03","The shipmistress often looks like I feel. Probably because she was meant for better than being a ferry captain."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_a_04","All these vessels coming and going. Shipmistress Brahms shoulders a great responsibility."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_b_01","She was born to high station. That brings burdens and responsibilities."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_b_02","I suspect she has spent her life subject to expectation. I know exactly how she feels."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_c_01","You will never understand the burdens intellect and breeding place upon those who have them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_three_c_02","I don't expect a commoner such as you to understand ... well, anything really."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_two_b_01","A courageous sentiment, given our situation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Splendid. This conversation already has the feel of a pre-emptive eulogy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_two_c_01","In any case, surely xenophobia has to go out of style eventually? Yes? Yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Travel broadens the mind. That's why our superiors fear it so. Narrow minds are more tractable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_four_b_02","They look upon disease as a blessing - is not pestilence the most unfettered form of life? Some misguided souls would call it divine."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_four_c_01","Their contagion spreads like belief. Where we see corruption, they see liberation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_four_c_02","The spread of decay is more dangerous than the spread of ideas alone. And in the right conditions, much faster."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_one_b_01","I'd point out all the depraved and strange things they do as a sign of madness, but then I look at our own priests and... well."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_one_b_02","From what I can tell, Chaos deals in mortal souls as currency, and feeds off belief. How does this differ from the Emperor, precisely?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Desperate souls, who have known not kindness or mercy, might cling to any promise of deliverance. And who could blame them?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_one_c_02","We ask the common citizen to endure a life of hardship. Who can blame them for listening when a voice from beyond promises so much more...?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_a_01","They say within the Immaterium lies the Realm of Chaos: a twisted realm where the Ruinous Powers are made flesh."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_a_02","To gaze into the Immaterium risks falling into the Realm of Chaos. And from such a maddening place none could return."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_a_03","If you only understood how thin is the veil that separates us from the Realm of Chaos, you would likely lose your minds."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_a_04","Beyond the veil, within the shifting Immaterium there is a Realm of Chaos. It is where nightmares dwell, and souls go to die."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_b_01","I wouldn't pin too much on the veracity of such claims. Though I confess, whenever we venture into the Immaterium, I do dream... peculiar dreams..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_b_02","Careful, sibling. Speaking your mind in such company often results in the building of pyres, with us at their heart."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_c_01","I suppose next you'll be saying there's a garden of plagues where daemons of disease sprout into existence, and... Wait. Did I dream that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Nobody doubts there are daemon-worlds within the Immaterium... Is it so unlikely that their so-called ""Gods"" might make homes there too?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Nothing in the universe is incorruptible. A Space Marine just poses more of a challenge."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_two_b_02","Cadres of superhuman men, told to wage war with complete autonomy? What could possibly go wrong?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_chaos_two_c_01","I've always been fascinated by the legend of the Thousand Sons. A legion of rogue psykers... That must be quite a sight!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_four_b_01","The Ordo Malleus call it the Anathema Nonplus Ultra... But that's because they like to be special."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_four_b_02","The Ocularis Terribus. Home of Daemons. Launchpad of a thousand Black Crusades... Least that's what it feels like."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_four_c_01","It is the unblinking eye of prophecy. And from it came legions of Daemons... they wait there still."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Be thankful you aren't blessed with the Sight. The screams of Cadia's dead still echo in my mind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Daemons are extra-dimensional beings that seek ingress to the materium. Pray they don't find it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_one_b_02","What a mercy it must be to lack imagination, blissfully unaware of the enemy at your threshold."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_one_c_01","The opening of the Great Rift has made Daemonic incursions more common than any would like to admit."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Should an incursion tear its way into this hive, all will be lost."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_a_01","Most have no idea what psykers must go through to avoid the predations of the daemon."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_a_02","My ""training"" for this mission was more akin to torture. Better than suffering Daemonic interference, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_a_03","To think of the inhuman treatment I suffered to strengthen my mind against... the Other..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_a_04","Daemons are drawn to my kind like moths unto flame. Pray to your Carrion Lord that they never get in."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_b_01","Careful, Sibling, we're around small and insignificant minds now. They might think you're ripe for possession."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_b_02","Daemons can exist in the Materium for but a limited time... unless they possess a living, psychic host."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_c_01","There are some within the Inquisition who would knowingly create a Daemonhost. I would rather die before such a fate."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_three_c_02","If daemonic possession troubles you so, wait until I tell you what the radicals of the Ordo Malleus get up to..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_two_b_01","Had it not been for the dimming of the Astronomican, such a thing would have been impossible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_two_b_02","They came from a Warp storm, it's said. It seems unthinkable one could form so close to Terra."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_two_c_01","For all Guilliman's strength, it was the Sisters of Silence who prevailed. They're a blessing and a curse both..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_daemons_two_c_02","Though I curse the day the Sisters of Silence returned, they're certainly effective against Daemons."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_diction_a_01","Your fancy pronunciation can't hide the fact you don't know Low Gothic from High, Fanatic. You're just pretending."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_diction_c_01","Shouldn't that be ""How darest thou sayeth such things?"" Details matter."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","Next time you see a Missionary, ask them about the Imperial Truth. That'll be fun."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","From the mouths of Brutes come truth it seems. But not the Imperial Truth. I believe that doctrine is now deemed heresy..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","The Imperium is shackled to millennia-old beliefs in a godhead who himself fought against the notion. It'd be funny, if it weren't so sad."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","No god could wish this bitter existence on his followers. The truth, I imagine, is long forgotten."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","Personally I would think twice before calling on the Chamber Militant of the Ecclesiarchy..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Hmm. More overzealous Witch Hunters. Just what Atoma needs."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","I've lived this long without seeing the Battle Sisters in action. I'll be happy to go a little longer."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","I hear the Battle Sisters are rather... indiscriminate when it comes to cleansing and purging."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_01","I sometimes wonder just how far the Carrion Lord's word would spread were it not for the Missionarus Galaxia."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_02","The Missionarus Galaxia are an odd bunch. Always spreading light to those who'd much prefer the dark."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_03","There are far-flung worlds who know nothing of the Imperial Creed. At least until the Missionarus Galaxia go poking their noses in."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_04","Sometimes I wish I could escape to a far-off world beyond this creed. Even beyond the reach of the Missionarus Galaxia."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Considering how holy they purport to be, Missionaries are rather keen to oversee atrocities on the fringes of the galaxy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","Many are the isolated worlds who would do well to fear the coming of the Missionary Vessels."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","They also serve as exterminators. Woe betide any xenos who happens to be minding its own business when the Missionaries arrive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","I'm sure Missionaries are a welcome sight... Unless you're a mutant, non-believer or alien."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","Why not, Fanatic? A cardinal is not much different from you. Except for the fabulous riches and frequent baths."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","If you write to the Cardinals, best leave out the part about consorting with psykers. They won't like that bit."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","As far as I'm concerned, the Cardinals-Astra and the Cardinals-Terra are in competition for biggest dogmatists and silliest hats."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Goge Vandire was Ecclesiarch once, wasn't he? And look how that turned out..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","I am a mutant, Brute, though it is uncouth to say so. So is the Mourningstar's Navigator. We are touched by the Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","I believe the definition is: ""Anyone who is not of use to the Imperium."""
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","If your definition relies on the Godolkin Purebreed Index, we're all up for the firing squad."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","The treatment of psykers is a particular travesty. Granted, they can become gateways to Hel, but that's beside the point."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_01","Having seen the methods of the Inquisition first-hand, doing their bidding makes me ... itchy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_02","I accept the importance of our work, but are not the methods of the Inquisition barbaric?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_03","It is hard to reconcile our methods with the notion that we do good in this benighted galaxy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_a_04","If the Emperor is so beneficent, why does he sanction the cruel and unusual methods of the Ordo Hereticus?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","The killing of heretics was expected. How long before we are called to torture the innocent?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","So much training, and for what? Just so I could turn the excruciators on some blameless wretch?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Those who life a life in fear have more reason to rebel. Perhaps we are not the cure, but the cause."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","It's rather hard not to be guilty of some crime or other in the eyes of the enthusiast."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Oh, joy. The Fanatic is off on another witch-hunt."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Psykers represent Humanity's future. They need help, not hatred."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","Pointing out that the Emperor himself is a psyker would be fruitless exercise, wouldn't it? [Sigh] Thought so."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","The most persecuted race in the Imperium is also the most vital to its survival. The irony."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","It is the consequence of losing half the Imperium behind a veil of nightmares..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","The crusade is a wave of violence fought in a realm of nightmare, instigated by warmongers and madmen."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Always with the grand display of force when subtlety would serve better."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","The lengths some will go to in order to earn a parade ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Be thankful the Cadian Gate did not fall also. He who controls the Gate controls Terra..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","And now the Great Rift looms, and the Imperium split in twain. The light falters..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","There's more to the fall of Cadia than we'll ever know. The Great Rift didn't make itself..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","The Eye of Terror was ever a haunt of evils and long forgotten mistakes. They have a habit of returning."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_01","The Great Awakening has set Mankind on a new path. So many new psykers cry out for guidance!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_02","The opening of the Rift was felt by all my kind, like an act of violence. And its aftermath came the awakening of psykers."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_04","The Great Awakening is both blessing and curse. So much power now courses through us, but at such a cost..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","Dark times are coming. The Black Ships will be packed as never before."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","So many psykers are desperate and confused, like lost children. Yet they are hunted without mercy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","We will have to see what the future holds. I'm sure it will be ... depressing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","Not matter how bad things become, we can rely on the Administratum to make them worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","When the Noctis Aeterna came, I confess I thought the end had come. To see the Astronomican falter, even for a second, seemed impossible..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","When the light of the Astronomican flickered, I thought my mind may fracture. The Noctis Aeterna that followed was worse still."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","Much was lost during the Noctis Aeterna. I doubt we'll ever know the full extent - which is just how certain parties prefer it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","I still have visions of the darkest times... For all the horror of its creation, I would not be without the Astronomican's light ever again..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Yes. Would it kill some of them to wash?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","Yes. The Mourningstar is gaining a rather distinct ... odour."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","Nothing but ruffians and wastrels. I was meant for better."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","I really though I'd be keeping better company by now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","You expect an Inquisitor to be straightforward and open? Hah!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","Does the weapon ever know much about the hand that wields it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","It's natural to feel some discomfort. Answers will come in time, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","The Imperium is generous with mystery, and frugal with answers. This is nothing new."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_01","Is the situation is so dire, surely Grendyl should be here in person?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_02","If this war is going so badly, why does Grendyl not take direct charge?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_03","Grendyl seems to keep Atoma at arm's length."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_a_04","If Atoma is so important, why does Grendyl not take more of an active role?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","The Inquisitor must have many concerns. It may be that Atoma is the least of them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","I suspect Inquisitor's web of responsibility stretches far from Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","I don't see how any of this speculation helps our current situation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","Why are we wasting valuable breath on this topic?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","There we go ... Looking for a way to ingratiate yourself. Grendyl barely knows you exist. If at all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","You have narrow way of regarding the world, Fanatic. It's ... unbecoming."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Devout or distant, we will fight and die all the same. What choice do we have?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","None of this will change our fate. We are but cogs in an uncaring machine."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_four_b_01","I find that ... unlikely."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_four_b_02","I understand her, of course, but then I do have an incomparable mind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_four_c_01","The Brute clearly has untapped potential. Which is more than I can say for some."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_four_c_02","The Brute is clearly an asset. I shall try to be nicer."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I'm sorry, were you asking me to favour one blunt over another?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_one_b_02","I find her directness rather refreshing ... Even if she is full of herself."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_one_c_01","Honestly, you should probably worry more about me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Ah, she's nothing to worry about ... unless you have an irrational fear of precision."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_a_01","I do find the Tech-Priest's thoughts hard to read."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_a_02","The Tech-Priest's mind is ordered, yet impenetrable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_a_03","The Tech-Priest orders her thoughts with painful precision."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_a_04","Poking around the Tech-Priest's head is like strolling blindfold through a technical manual."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I trust you were careful. You don't want to get caught."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Not so loud! She might be listening!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_c_01","Ach! Where's the harm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_three_c_02","You worry too much."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Her soul does seem to have withered a good deal, it's true."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Her soul is shrivelled and bitter. Much like mine."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_two_c_01","It hardly matter how long a lifetime of suffering lasts. That the suffering exists is what should concern us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hadron_two_c_02","I intend to live a long, sinful life ... assuming I make it through this war."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","Did you ask yourself why she always has vacancies? Hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","Dead men's shoes, hmmm? And there are such a lot of shoes to fill."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","I think you would be very foolish to choose that course ... But then, of course, you are."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Wiser to stay where you are, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","Really? Do tell."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","The purser? Oh, I would believe anything of her."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","You don't want to know what happened to the last fellow who stole from her stores."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","She has a very ... colourful ... way of dealing with thieves. Quite loud, too."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_01","The purser's prices are a touch ... extravagant, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_02","I cannot believe the purser's prices. Excessive doesn't being to do them justice."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_03","The purser must think me a fool to accept her prices as they are."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_a_04","The purser must think we are all made of aquilas to charge as she does."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","I would negotiate with her ... but that stare [Shudders]."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","I for one do not wish to antagonise her over mere commerce."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Ach, trinkets and baubles interest me little anyway. I am purer than that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","It is just as well that I am above flimsy gewgaws and tacky coin-grubbing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","She's personable enough. Unlike some I might mention."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Yes, well ... she is a little rough around the edges."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","I'm not saying that I enjoy her company, of course. I wouldn't want to mislead."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She'd not exactly be my first choice for a dinner companion."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","A hive city is a physical representation of Imperial society. The privileged few look down from on high upon the teeming masses."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","At the very top, you'll find the highborns. Those not born into wealth earn it from the toil of the common worker."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","You'll find the noble houses are often patrons of the Ecclesiarchy. Remember, all of us are judged, but some more than others."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","It's the middle you have to watch out for. It's where the enforcers reside, ensuring everybody stays in their appointed place."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Most of the time they simply fight amongst themselves."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Most gang violence comes from turf wars and other petty squabbles."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Those who have only known the yoke of tyranny can dream only of a chance to crack the whip."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","The temptation to visit violence upon these wayward souls is strong: But remember that's precisely what drove them to the crimelords to start with."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_01","Hive-cities are indicative of a crumbling Imperium. Billions crammed into spaces unfit for habitation, the secrets of their construction lost to time."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_02","If ever you wish to experience every form of human degradation, depravity and despair, look you to the hive cities."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_03","Too many souls suffering ill treatment, a ruling class who cares not, and too few enforcers per head. Hive-cities are a breeding ground for insurrection."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_a_04","Hive-cities are much like their namesakes. Billions of good little drones all working themselves to death for an unknowable Emperor."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","I hear a typical hab-unit is but three metres square. A cold, unforgiving cell that generations call home."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","There is no privacy in a hive. No time when a hiver is not shoulder-to-shoulder with their fellows. Imagine being a nascent psyker in such a place."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","If Tertium is the best example of the Atoman hives, I pity the wretches who inhabit the others."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","I would hazard that those who dwell spireside have no such squalor with which to contend."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Control of these manufactorums will tip the balance of power in this sector. That's the real reason we're here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","If it weren't for the inherent value of the manufactorums, Grendyl would have ordered an orbital strike on Hive Tertium by now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","Imagine spending a life toiling at blistering forges and breathing acrid air, only to earn death in a senseless battle."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","Metalfabs are quite soulless. Maybe it's the servitors. Maybe it's because the heretics have murdered all the workers."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_four_b_02","On Terra, they ring the Bell of Lost Souls when heroes die. We'll be lucky if they get our names right on the grave-marker."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_four_c_01","We should just count our blessings anyone even remembers where they left us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_four_c_02","I can see it now. You and me, up there on the roll of honour alongside Solar Macharius himself..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_one_b_01","If I ever reach Terra, it will be as sacrifice to your Carrion Lord. Forgive me for not being so eager."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_one_b_02","Oh no, Roughneck. If my kind go to Terra, we do not return."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_one_c_01","I am as close as I ever want to get to your Emperor, thank you very much."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_one_c_02","I am content where I am. Less chance of having my brain leak out of my ears this way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_a_01","I wonder how Atoma pays its tithe to your ""beneficent"" Emperor? Unfairly, and harshly, I'd guess."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_a_02","You speak of a great and benevolent Imperium, but so many worlds are crippled by unfair tithes."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_a_03","We're only restoring Atoma so it can start paying a crippling tithe, and you know it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_a_04","Have you ever heard of a world that actually benefits from the Imperial Tithe? It is a travesty."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_b_01","There are many who revere the tithe. The cretins embrace their own suffering, and give thanks for it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_b_02","The tithe exists to keep the worlds outside the Terran heartlands in their place. That is all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_c_01","When a world cannot pay, governors are executed. Populations are conscripted. And you call this fair."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Payment comes not through duty, but through fear of reprisal. The Imperium is built upon brutality."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_two_b_01","And all of them filled with running, and fighting, and screaming. Lots of screaming."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_two_b_02","It seems the Carrion Lord's thirst for war knows no bounds."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_two_c_01","So many wonders, and I must spend my life battling horrors in a squalid Hive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_imperium_two_c_02","If I get half a chance, I'll run to the world farthest from all this death."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","They have a habit of killing leaders without thought of consequence. Perhaps they've been here already."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","It would barely surprise me to learn they've been here already. Perhaps we're to clean up the mess they made."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","Funny. I always thought my life might be ended by a Culexus Assassin. Now I do their work for them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Imagine spending all this time doing the Emperor's dirty work, just for a Culexus Assassin to turn my brains to mush."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","The cost of an orbital bombardment is worth more than the lives of every man, woman and child on this accursed world."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","There must be something of value here, or they'd have done it already."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","How easily you consider extinguishing the lives of millions."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Do you really think they'd bother to evacuate us first? Careful what you wish for..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_01","So strange... A lifetime of tyranny under Imperial Law, now to find myself above it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_02","Being above Imperial Law is a singular advantage of joining the Inquisition. A small mercy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_03","One barely understands the true unfairness of Imperial Law until one stands above it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_a_04","It seems that we in the Inquisition enforce Imperial Law whilst standing above it ourselves."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","I suppose I could take some small satisfaction in terrorising errant enforcers... Were I the vengeful sort."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","The shoe is indeed on the other foot. I would give much for the local enforcers to test my patience now..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","The Lex Imperialis was written by Man. Man is fallible. Thus, the Lex is fallible, no?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","Strange, is it not, how malleable Imperial Law can be when it suits not the needs of the powerful?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","Our order is certainly feared. Probably due to all the hunting and burning of innocents."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Oddly enough, working for people who call themselves ""Witch Hunters"" is hardly my idea of fulfilling employment."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","Those you call ""Witch""... ""Mutant""... ""Traitor"". How many has Grendyl put to death I wonder?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","I have heard of entire worlds being scoured by our order for the mere suspicion of mutation. Very noble."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","I know not how it functions, Brute, but I can tell you how it is powered: by the souls of innocents."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","It is a tower of ancient machinery, powered by souls, and guarded by the ignorant."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","The Golden Throne is a prison for its maker, and a device of torture for its attendants."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","All I know is, the Golden Throne hungers, and its appetite becomes more voracious with each passing day."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","The man in the polished gold armour, with a battleship named after himself? Someone was overcompensating."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Was his favoured tactic not orbital bombardment? No matter how much of the native population were slain? Very heroic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","Men like that don't just get sick and die. That's just what the Adeptus Terra want you to think..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","Heard he met an ignominious end. I think it more likely he got on the wrong side of the Officio Assassinorum."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_01","When I think of all the eras past, and knowledge lost, I conclude surely we're in the Age of Ignorance."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_02","What an age of ignorance we dwell in, that knowledge of past eras is disregarded as heresy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_03","A pity the Great Awakening led not to true enlightenment. Still we cling to ignorance, ignoring the lessons of the past."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_a_04","The Imperium is built on superstition and myth - you cretins are afraid to learn from the past."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Let them repeat the mistakes of the past. They'll bring about a new Age of Strife before they're done."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","We stand on the cusp of a new Age of Strife, yet our masters are too timid to learn history's lessons."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","We're wasting our breath. Some would rather pray to a Warp engine than learn its function."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","The Imperium began with an Age of Progress... Now it seems ""progress"" is considered sinful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","It really is a matter of perspective, and whether you think the right side won."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","Interesting priorities you have there, Fanatic. I'd have thought the Horus Heresy might be a teensy bit more tragic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Sebastian Thor overthrew Vandire... But was not Thor also accused of heresy? I lose track of all the corruption."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Well, I for one cannot celebrate the survival of the Ecclesiarchy, in any form."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_four_b_01","Yes, yes, yes. Loyalty forgives all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_four_b_02","Loyalty is the highest coin in the Imperium, when it should be truth."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_four_c_01","Some are born to servitude. Others have it thrust upon them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_four_c_02","Better to push datawork in heaven than serve in hel."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_one_b_01","You're surely not talking of the Lord Darius Melk, scion of the noble House Straxamus? Not with that tone, anyway."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_one_b_02","My apologies, but I only know a Lord Darius Melk, the peerless crystallographic watercolourist and mentor."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_one_c_01","No wonder you don't get on. You don't offer the proper form of address."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_one_c_02","Careless of you to forget the title. Try to remember it next time."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_a_01","Sire Melk pretends superiority, but I suspect he is no more or less a criminal than we."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_a_02","I wonder what secrets Sire Melk conceals? Hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_a_03","Sire Melk surely has secrets. I wonder what they are."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_a_04","Sire Melk cannot be as blameless as he seems. I mean, look at the company he keeps."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_b_01","Quite literally a great many skeletons in cupboards, no doubt."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_b_02","Dear me. Bureaucratic skulduggery is so very tedious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_c_01","It's not really surprising. An Inquisitor's greatest power is leverage."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_three_c_02","The more I learn about this crew, the more Grendyl is shown to be either desperate, or a romantic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_two_b_01","You must admit, you can be ... a touch inconsistent."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_two_b_02","He is a scholar, so naturally he expects more precision than you provide."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_two_c_01","Perhaps Melk would tutor you ... if you asked him nicely?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_melk_two_c_02","Melk merely confirmed what I have long suspected."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_four_b_01","You are credulous, Brute. Never gamble."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Really, Brute. Is there anything you will not believe?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Pfah! So Morrow is a little inhuman. That's to be celebrated, not sneered at."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_four_c_02","From what I've seen of humanity we might all be better off thus."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Really? Is there anywhere that man has not been?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Ah! The ring of verisimilitude!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Can't we talk about something more interesting?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_one_c_02","What is this fascination with the sergeant, anyway? I'm sure he's not worth it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_a_01","Don't you think it is strange that there are so many impossible stories about Morrow's past accomplishments?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_a_02","Morrow's past is full of embellishments ... Do you not agree?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_a_03","All these stories about Morrow. Obvious lies, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_a_04","Surely these stories about Morrow cannot be true. You concur, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_b_01","You should not listen to rumours, Sibling. Unless I start them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_b_02","What does it matter? What does he matter?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_c_01","The galaxy is full of preposterous tales. Often, the most unlikely are the truest."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_three_c_02","You could always ask Morrow directly ... if you dare ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Oh yes, anyone can see he's an ancient wreck, tottering about."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_two_b_02","He looks unusually hale for a man of such weighty years, does he not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Any simpleton can see it's a story to gull the credulous ... Well, almost any simpleton."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_morrow_two_c_02","It is a bare-faced invention. Can you not see that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Form over function has never impressed me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Alas, I favour efficiency over lavish decoration."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","Alas, voidships alone will not win this war."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Even vessels such as this cannot prevail against what is coming."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_four_b_01","A mind like his would be wasted in the meat grinder. I should know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Some of us are better suited to oversight than front line battle. I envy him."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_four_c_01","You do worry about the strangest things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_four_c_02","Why concern yourselves with something you cannot affect?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He's a calculating man. Never takes a risk. Obsessed with data."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_one_b_02","He's the sort that would render the world to certainties, if he could."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Ach, why worry? It will all be the same in a hundred years. We'll all be food for the worms."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_one_c_02","If you want him to like you, maybe you should give him a present. I'm sure that will work."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_a_01","Whispers abound that Rannick is destined for greater things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_a_02","The Mourningstar is full of rumour ... that Rannick's star is on the rise."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_a_03","Rannick is a man to watch ... at least, so I hear."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_a_04","Interrogator Rannick seems meant for higher things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_b_01","It is said that Inquisitors are not born, but forged through trial. Grendyl may intend Atoma to be Rannick's trial."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Perhaps Grendyl is growing old, and fears leaving his work undone with no successor to see it completed?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_c_01","One thing is certain: Rannick's fate is bound to that of this world, for good or ill."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_three_c_02","Rannick and Atoma are now entwined. As are we. I don't think I like that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Oh, the horror! This calls for immediate execution. You should tell him so."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Not everyone wears their obsessions as plainly as you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_two_c_01","I imagine that as long as Rannick gets results, no one save you will care."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_rannick_two_c_02","I refuse to believe that he could rise so high while defying the Emperor's glory."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Their souls are leaden and dull. Whatever they once were is long stripped away."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_servitors_one_b_02","They are echoes of life, bound to wires and circuitry. I find them ... distasteful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_servitors_one_c_01","In the end, we're all just components, waiting for repurposing. The trick lies in staying useful as you are."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_servitors_one_c_02","Brutal practicality in action. If you cannot serve in your current form, someone will find you another."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Genetic modification, how else? Probably painful. Explains their sunny disposition."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","I hear they get implanted with an organ called a Biscopea. I expect it's very painful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","I heard they can gain a creature's memory by eating its flesh. And you call me the freak!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","Seven feet tall, solid ribcage, near-immortal... But yes, tell me again why I'm the mutant?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Forgive my lack of enthusiasm, but the Adeptus Astartes are even less tolerant of my kind than the Imperial Guard."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","Wonderful. I might live to get purged by a seven-foot-tall power-armoured tyrant. Can't wait."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Strange how some augmentations are venerated, yet others reviled."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","Are Space Marines truly human? If not, why do you hero-worship them so? Strange, is it not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_01","Can it really be true that Roboute Guilliman has returned? It barely seems possible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_02","If Roboute Guilliman really is back, it must presage some great calamity."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_03","If Roboute Guilliman is truly back, the future will be bleak indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_a_04","It seems not possible that Roboute Guilliman has returned... Is it a blessing, or a curse?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","I expect he'll be worshipped as a god soon. Another superhuman tyrant in whose name worlds will burn."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","Maybe all the Primarchs will come back. The good ones and the bad ones. That'll be fun."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","All this talk about the purity of humanity. Yet now we're led by a giant from another era..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Some might call a man like that ""mutant"". Put him in power armour and he's suddenly a saviour."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","The Codex served its purpose, but now it's just another dogma to replace a lack of pragmatism."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Does not current wisdom hold the Codex as a tool of blind dogma? Something you'd know all about."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","One must display grudging respect for those Chapters who deviated from Guilliman's dictates."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","The Codex Astartes is sacrosanct... And yet many chapters deviate from its teachings. Curious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_surgeon_one_c_01","Oh ... You should let me tell you about what's in our rations ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_surgeon_one_c_02","Take my advice ... Don't look at your rations too closely."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","They would have us believe he is a god, though I fancy he's little more than a shrivelled cadaver."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","A shrivelled, rotting corpse. A carrion-lord, terrible to behold."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Perhaps those who've undertaken the Soul-Binding have seen his face... If only we could ask them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","I fear we shall all see His face in the next life, and it will be terrible to behold."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","If he is as powerful as they say, one word from his shrivelled lips would tear apart your tiny minds."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He has given but one command in ten thousand years: to maintain the Imperium, no matter the cost."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","The Inquisitor Lords claim to know the Emperor's will, but we all know it's the High Lords of Terra who rule."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","We're to believe only the Senatorum Imperialis know his inscrutable will. How convenient."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_01","The Emperor survives on human flesh and human blood... His Imperium likewise."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_02","You exalt the Emperor, yet forgive the sacrifice of souls made in His name each and every day."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_03","I offer no praise to the Emperor. He is a carrion-lord, who feasts upon the souls of my kind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_a_04","How many souls are consumed by the Emperor each day? And yet we exalt Him?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Silence, freak! Those sacrifices doth pay for the Astronomican, without which the Imperium wouldst crumble!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","They say without the light of the Astronomican, the Imperium would crumble. Would that be so bad?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","If it weren't for Grendyl, I'd probably be just another morsel for the carrion lord. Not sure which fate is worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","What was it they taught us at training camp? The fate of the Mutant is to be cleansed? How comforting..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","The Golden Throne is a prison - not just for the Emperor, but for us all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","Ah, yes. All of us shackled to this monolithic regime should be thankful for the Emperor's carelessness."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","They say if the Emperor fails, all life will end. But while he endures, do any of us truly live?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","If he'd had the good grace to simply die, perhaps Mankind could have found its own way in the universe."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Psykers - who you're meant to hate - create a big beacon, which special mutants - who you're also meant to hate - can follow. You follow?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","The Empyrean calls to us with honeyed whispers, and Mankind - being fuelled by greed - answers eagerly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","I would tell you of the thousand psykers sacrificed each day to the Astronomican, but the others wouldn't like that..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","Warp travel, like all the Imperium's advancements, is made possible through death and suffering."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","The things you fear in the Immaterium are the very things I confront every waking hour."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","Be thankful you only have to fear the Warp between missions. For me, the terrors of the Warp are the mission."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","[Tsk] And to think our creed takes such a dim view of mutation, when it is the Navis Nobilite who deliver us safely through the Warp."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","Each time we hurl ourselves into the Empyrean, we put our lives in the hands of the Navigators."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_01","It is somewhat vexatious, is it not, how time flows differently in the Warp?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_02","The vagaries of time displacement within the Empyrean are truly beyond even my keen intellect."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_03","Each time we gaze into the Empyrean, the erratic flow of time seems more disconcerting."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_a_04","Time is erratic within the Empyrean... It is hard to calculate how long each jump truly takes."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","The Warp is a strange and terrible place. Time is the least of your worries."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Be thankful to emerge from the Warp at all. Many a traveller has been cast adrift for eternity on the Sea of Souls."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","You imagine the Empyrean as merely a void, but it is a living ocean, full of tides, storms... and predators."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","I have heard tell, but once, of a vessel emerging from the Warp before it had begun its journey."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","You realise that Warp entities are creatures given form by your own thoughts? Everyone brings their own ghosts into the Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Warp entities are your fears made manifest. And they dwell in the Empyrean long after your passing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Oh, if only you knew what dread hands clawed at the hull during each journey, you'd never make a Warp-jump again."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","The very power that guides a vessel through the Empyrean attracts these spectres like moths to a flame."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","A very sensible stance, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Indeed? The Brute shows some taste."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","I think it's comradely. I approve."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","Well, Ogryns and Psykers are the future, after all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","I don't know what you mean. She's perfectly civil."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Ah yes, the narrow mind of the blunt on display once more."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","I don't wish to appear uncaring ... but alas, I am."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Such a lot of bother over nothing ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_01","I had a delightful conversation with Sefoni earlier."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_02","That Sefoni! She really does have a way with words."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_03","I had a truly splendid conversation with Sefoni earlier. What a charmer!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_a_04","I think Sefoni might be the only soul on the Mourningstar who matches my intellect."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","She is a delight, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Such a sparkling soul. I am in awe."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","She has a remarkable sense of humour ... Though you may not be able to appreciate it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Such a mind! Dextrous and sharpened to a razor point."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","You should consider yourself fortunate to have such a diligent mentor."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","She is dedicated, direct and very efficient. I do not see the concern."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","I think the Fanatic believes Sefoni's place is on a pyre ... alongside all my kind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","You really need to work on your anti-psyker bigotry. I might take offence."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_01","I swear, the worst part of all this is the orbital drop."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_02","I hate everything about this life, but the orbital drop is the very worst!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_03","I loathe deploying for a mission. So noisy! So stomach-wrenching!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_a_04","I wish our pilot would fly smoother! I have a delicate constitution."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","I know what you mean. I suspect Masozi aims for air pockets. She has a peculiar sense of humour."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","Yes. It's all very uncivilised."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Well, I suppose we haven't yet exploded, so it could be worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","My incomparable mind deserves better treatment ... not that anyone cares."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_war_end_b_01","Wars seldom end cleanly, Brute. They simply change locale."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_war_end_b_02","From certain perspectives, this war has been raging for ten millennia. It is eternal."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_war_end_c_01","Strife is humanity's beating heart. There will never be peace."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_war_end_c_02","There is only war. Now and forever."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_four_b_01","I don't doubt it, Brute. And I'm sure there's worse still out there, not that anyone would bother telling us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_four_b_02","If it's true, I'm sure you can expect a mind-wipe any day now. And if it's not... Well, we expect nothing more of you, dear Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_four_c_01","It sounds like something the Tyranids might do, for are those vile creatures not masters of biological manipulation?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_four_c_02","Who knows what lurks out there in the darkness, especially now so many worlds lie lost in the Imperium Nihilus."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_one_b_02","You will come to understand that not all enemies can be defeated with blade and bullet. We hunt something worse than xenos."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_one_c_01","I have heard of a race called the T'au, who claim no connection to the Immaterium whatsoever. I didn't think such a thing possible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_one_c_02","I note that most xenos seem to embrace the psykers in their midst rather than seek to exterminate them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_a_01","Some seek to harness the knowledge of xenos races, yet are looked upon as heretics. Why must knowledge be so feared?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_a_02","The xenos possess knowledge and technology beyond imagining, yet we rarely seek to learn from them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_a_03","Imagine if we shared knowledge with the xenos instead of seeking to destroy them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_a_04","Some xenos possess knowledge that could be invaluable in the fight against Chaos. And yet out of ignorance we deny it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_b_01","We barely understand how our own wargear works. Designs of most xenos artefacts must be beyond our brightest minds."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_b_02","Do we not form alliances of convenience when necessary? Even Roboute Guilliman treated with the Aeldari for the common good."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_c_01","The Aeldari fascinate me. It's said they have developed safe portals between realspace and the Immaterium."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_three_c_02","Imagine if we could unlock the secrets of the Aeldari Webway. Such knowledge would be of immeasurable value."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_two_b_01","The Awakening must have affected the Aeldari as much as us. Perhaps worse, for are they not a psychic race?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_two_b_02","We should look to the Aeldari and learn from them. For are they not living proof of what the human race is to become?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_two_c_01","They think we're backwards and crude ... they're probably right. Certainly about the rest of you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_xenos_two_c_02","At least they look after their own, even in the afterlife. What is there for us but an eternity of torment in the Immaterium?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_four_b_01","Yes ... Her appearance does not do her credit."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_four_b_02","I have known many like her. All came to a bad end."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_four_c_01","Let us hope she's not ... unexpectedly brittle."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_four_c_02","Strength of purpose and strength of character are not the same thing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_one_b_01","She is a study in contradictions, certainly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_one_b_02","You should see inside her head ... Or so I'm told."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_one_c_01","While she holds authority over us, our mere opinions hardly matter."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_one_c_02","All irrelevant. She holds power of life and death. We have no choice but to obey."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_a_01","Zola's manner is a muddle. Cultured and common ... though she hides the latter."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_a_02","Zola is a curious creature, born of the gutter and the spires."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_a_03","Zola ... is an interesting mix of contradictions, I find."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_a_04","Zola is a most intriguing soul. So many ambitions, fighting for dominance."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_b_01","She is dangerous. And perhaps not to us alone."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_b_02","She walks a dangerous line. Then again, who around here does not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_c_01","Personally. I would very much like to examine her brain. In detail."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_three_c_02","She makes for a fascinating test subj-- superior, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_two_b_01","I prefer to see the world as it is ... unclogged by incense."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_two_b_02","Faith is but the hope of a dream that too often begets nightmare."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_two_c_01","The lost will often follow any light, wherever it leads."
"loc_psyker_male_a__lore_zola_two_c_02","Faith is well enough, but it does so easily become mania."
"loc_psyker_male_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Fetch. Carry. Is it too much to ask for some help?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","I have one!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_alarm_01","Oh look, a heretic summoning cacophony. How nice!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_alarm_02","Where is that wretched alarm anyway?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","Closed. Of course it is!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","I don't want to be naysayer - well actually I do, but you don't appreciate it - but that door is very closed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","Not everything written down is valuable. Quality is always superior to quantity."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","So many words. So much data. So little wisdom."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","I'm sure this data will expose many traitors. Or those who are said to be so."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","I find the burden of proof falls differently once the words ""heresy"" is uttered."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","The effort that went into this archivum. I'm sure a series of boxes would do just as well."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","This archivum is unnecessarily grandiose, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","What a delight! I always dreamed of visiting a place like this ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Oh, you are spoiling us. What a treat this mission has already become ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Retrieval via the air seems needless. We should simply steal the train."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Why can we not simply drive the train to a new location?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Very well. We'll do it your way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Oh far be it from me to question your almighty wisdom ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Are you another indentured servant, Tech Priest, or a willing soldier?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Did you choose this path, Tech Priest? Or was it chosen for you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","So many words. So little information."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Ah, unearned superiority. How familiar."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","One trusts our support team won't abandon us?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Who truly believes this support team will be here in time?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Very reassuring. You give a warm glow inside."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh, I will stop worrying then, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Toil without thought or reward. The Imperium would make us all machines, if it could."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","It is not for want of activity that Atoma falls."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","How do we even know we're going the right way?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","Admit it! We're lost!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Death still lingers in this place. Desperation is thick upon the air."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Can you not feel the death in this place? The torment?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","If there are so many soldiers already here, why are we needed?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","Yes, of course! Send the psyker in to do the fighting while the soldiers watch!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Criminals. Pfah. Always preying on the weak."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Braggarts and bullies always cling to pomp and pagentry. I doubt the cartel was any different."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Temper, temper, explicator. That's hardly the dispassion Grendyl expects, is it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","I'm sure there are a few gunhands left that you could hunt down and … chastise."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","It strikes me as peculiar that the Water Cartel were so easily subverted."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","So, for all their braggadocio, the Water Cartel collapsed from within."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","So noted. Let the knowledge serve us well."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Lesser minds often make elementary mistakes."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I'm intrigued. You were once a pauper and a criminal, and now you are an Inquisitor's hand? How?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","That you thrived in this place is a testament to your fortitude, explicator."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Touchy, aren't you? Brittle pride is the very worst."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","You should have a care with secrets. Nothing rots the soul more swiftly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Cartel or administratum, the craven revel in symbols to hide their vulnerability."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Iconography is often a shield, concealing weakness of mind and purpose. The Water Cartel is no different."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","They're using the tarpaulins to filter the water. Very ingenious. Very … pitiable, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","Humanity should not be reduced to scavenging polluted waters … even if they are Blunts."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","Crumbling. But then, what corner of the Imperium is not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","To think, someone was once proud of these buildings. No accounting for taste, is there?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","We've reached the bazaar. The only trade now is in death."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","Less a point of trade and more of an arena, would you not say?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_shanty_01","What a revolting place. I should not be subjected to such sights!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_shanty_02","You want the Emperor's truth? It is all around us. Behold the destiny of Mankind!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_water_course_01","That's no river! I wonder what would get me first: the toxins or the acids?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cartel_water_course_02","I don't what's worse about the river: the smell, or the stinging sensation in my eyes!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Why are these wretched elevators never on the right floor?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Oh good! Another fight to the death while the elevator whirrs!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Well, this is all very cloak and dagger. And probably pointless."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","I suppose it's nice to be trusted with something important ... or would be if we knew why."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","What a surprise. I'm so shocked I can barely stand. Truly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Well, I'm sure that won't end in tears."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","I note we've not been told who is receiving this transmission."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","So, we're just shooting a secret message out into space ... is that it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Oooh ... Tantalising. I'm sure the truth is deathly tedious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","Well, I'm no wiser than before, but still wiser than you by an order of magnitude."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","I imagine this message is important only to tiny minds."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","Only a stunted mind would care what was in this message, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Yes, I'm sure that's what you were told, anyway ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Your explanation has the ring of obfuscation."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Does anyone else have a bad feeling about this mission?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","The company I keep will be the death of me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_way_in_01","That's us ... Always with the grand entrances ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_complex_way_in_02","Well, at least it's not the ventilation system, the sewer, a chimney, a body bag ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","The damage appears extensive. Is it irreparable?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Hmmm … Those heretics have inflicted a great deal of damage. Can it be repaired?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","I think that was a 'yes'."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","I believe there was a 'yes' buried in there somewhere."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I've only heard talk of salvaging the building. What about those who laboured within?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The building may yet find salvation, but those who toiled here …? Are they of no account?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That's the caring Imperium I know and love. A place for everyone."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Heroes today. Fodder tomorrow. Imperial bureaucracy at its finest."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Given how Rannick's forces are overstretched, I assume this facility is vital?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","All this trouble. This facility must be more important than I assumed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","So we're not so expendable as Rannick would have us believe? At least, not today."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","I suppose it's nice to be needed … even if only by default."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_heat_01","Well, this temperature is most uncivilised, I must say. Just like everything else around here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_leaving_01","At last! Air that doesn't taste of burning!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_leaving_02","Good riddance to the place. I hope never to return."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Hiking in a power complex? Not how I'd have chosen to spend the day."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Don't you dare try to push me over the edge! I'm watching you!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","I swear this wretched place grows hotter the deeper we get."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","Are we not yet at Coolant Control? No? Very well, let us proceed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Crude armour plating. Then again, crudity is the lifeblood of the Imperium."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_production_line_02","I suppose that armour plating has a simple, uncomplicated charm."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","This manufactorum holds nothing in the way of comfort. Not that I am surprised."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Lacks the homely touch, wouldn't you say, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_deception_01","This mission calls for subtlety, but I've no doubt it'll turn into a bloodbath."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_deception_02","This is a mission for stealth, intellect and deftness. Why they sent you lot, I've no idea."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","There never was much justice in this place."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Ah, all the trappings of false justice. It's the same everywhere."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","So quickly the trappings of law and order fall into decay."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","This place has seen many owners, none of them generous souls."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Justice is a fleeting concept, I find."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Suffering is the Imperium's hardiest crop."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","I sense that this place troubles you, explicator."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Your thoughts are wrathful and dark, explicator. Do you need a hug?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I do so hate vague answers. Shameful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","How tantalising. How worthless as a reply."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","One should never ask why vermin nest where they do, but still I am curious: why a prison?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","It seems to me that our target has already imprisoned himself."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Ah, the side of the Imperium few see..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Like the Imperium, the hab may be solid, but its supports are hollow."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","I have hidden in many places like this. But only out of need."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","You would surprised how little the authorities pay heed to such places."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","Ah, the underbelly of civilisation... if you want to call it that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","A fascinating aroma. Very 'lived in'. Or possible 'smothered by'."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","I would trust no business transacted here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","A squalid corner and a den of misfits."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","I don't care for the angle of this floor."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","Yes, this looks very structurally sound."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_alive_01","The machine rouses!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_alive_02","The machine stirs! Keep at it!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Why is this manufactorum so important? Enquiring minds wish to know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Why are we even here. Are Leman Russ tanks so rare?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","A foolish pursuit. You'd do better to harness incomparable minds such as my own."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Hah! They are still naught when compared to a telekinetic shield!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I know much about Zola, and even Morrow ... but very little about you, Tech Priest."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","You're very secretive, Tech Priest. Surely there's something about yourself you can share?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","You see? That wasn't so hard, was it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Well, I suppose we shouldn't have expected better."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Is it me, or do the heretics take an unnecessarily complicated approach to sabotage?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Strange that our enemies should commit so mild a sabotage."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I knew it! Things can always get worse!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Perhaps it would be kinder to destroy the place while we're here, yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","I suppose we'd better find this smelter."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","If we don't find the smelter, Morrow will never let us hear the end of it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Can't ... Breathe ... Again ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_hellhole_02","My throat's ... Burning ... We have to leave."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_lifeless_01","The machine slumbers, and waits only to rouse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_lifeless_02","It's almost pitiable to see the machinery becalmed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","We're making a frontal assault? How thrilling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","We're marching up to the front gate? Whatever happened to guile?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_propaganda_01","See how readily mankind is reduced to toiling drones? Buzz. Buzz. Buzz."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_propaganda_02","Those who queue in this place are not workers. They're fuel."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Here they come! No surrender, no retreat!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Can that elevator not travel any faster?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","The air ... So bitter ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","I cannot ... breathe ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","I suspect there is more to this place's importance than we have been told."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Surely one manufactorum cannot make so much difference?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_hack_01","Servitors and machines do not reason, so they are easily outwitted. Much like the rest of you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_hack_02","Try not to drop your data-interrogators. You will need them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","A crude settlement for crude beings."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","I have lived in worse places, though not willingly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I sense something... terrible. Why?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","There is... something crawling at my mind..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Well, I suppose that explains that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I suppose it slipped everyone's mind. Those that have them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","You might explain why the daemon is here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I suppose the reason for the daemon's presence is a mystery?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","So much for the Imperium's eternal vigilance."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","I suspected as much, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Let us hope the daemonic matter is not widespread."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","I trust the daemon is contained in this area?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I think I'd like to go back to my cell now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","You needn't sound so cheerful. That's horrible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Cretins? I think the stairs will be a more suitable conveyance."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","Call me squeamish, but I'm not risking that elevator."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","My incomparable mind is proof against all heretic manipulations, I assure you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","A psychic pathogen to go along with the physical? Interesting, but far-fetched."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I will be staying away from ledges. I am allergic to sharp drops."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","By the Five Rusting Spires, how high are we now?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Why most we always walk so far? I imagine Rannick flies everywhere."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Another long walk awaits, I imagine. As usual."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","The air is dry and bitter. I empathise."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","The air almost tastes clean up here. I'm sure it's not, but I can dream."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Ach! Too bright. Can't we go back inside?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","I don't care for all this sunlight. It's... unhealthy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","They've sealed the doors!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","The heretics have sealed us in!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","We're trapped! The doors are sealed!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","We're locked in! This isn't going to be good!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Hello? Mourningstar? ... It's no good. They're jamming the vox!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Mourningstar? Mourningstar! This dratted vox isn't working!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Mourningstar? ... Oh splendid, the vox isn't working!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar! We're trapped! Mourningstar! ... Useless vox!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Just keep fighting! What else can we do?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","Oh good, a last stand. And it seemed like such a nice day."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","Well this is going entirely to plan ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","We're all going to die in here. I hope you realise that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_district_gate_01","The District Gate is sealed. How swiftly a home becomes a cage."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_district_gate_02","So the heretics closed the District Gate? Or was it the authorities attempting containment?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Ah, another bastion of Imperial bureaucracy. I'm not impressed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","This place looks important. Then again, ostentatiousness is the order of things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Then Hive security should have fought harder to hold it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","That's the trouble with ruling through force. Someone's always stronger."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You have detailed knowledge of this place, explicator?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","I sense you know a great deal more about this district, explicator."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","We all of us do what we must to survive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","So we are all of us fugitives, is that so?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","What need have I for tricksy ammunition when I have my incomparable mind?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","I don't see why a few trick bullets matter so much."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Fine. Keep your toys. See where it gets you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh no, I'm overwrought. However shall I kill heretics now? With my mind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","Let's avoid the hab block. Hab blocks mean crowds."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","We seem to be taking the long way around ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","Dark and dingy. Well, at least the gloom matches my mood ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Crawling through the dark. Again. I was meant for better."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_trains_01","This is not my first time in the Imperium's glorious bowels."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_rails_trains_02","I've lived in worse places than this."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Let's not play hide and seek with the heretics, please."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","Do try not to get lost, cretins."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Screaming hordes on one side, and on the other A BROKEN BRIDGE!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","Can't this thing move any faster?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","What a reassuring name. It's right up there with ""Pit of Death""."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","I'm sure nothing bad will happen to us on a bridge named thus. Nothing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","Why is nothing ever easy?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","Details, details, details. That's always where we go wrong."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","This is going to get nasty!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","We are definitely earning our substandard pay today!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Why can't they simply accept their defeat?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","These witless fools are no threat to me! Hah!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","A pulpit, but no sign of it's preacher. What an absolute shame."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","The usual ranter is absent from his pulpit, I see."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","No loss, though I'm sure it's not polite to say."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","The heretics have probably done the residents a favour."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Very seemly. But scratch the surface and there's something nasty beneath."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","The mask of dignity is the favoured headgear in these streets."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_retrieve_01","I do hope you're not expecting me to do any of the heavy lifting?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_retrieve_02","I'll be sure to leave the heavy lifting to you brutes. I was made for finer things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scan_01","A scanning mission? I was meant for better things."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scan_02","A scanning mission? Why bother? The Imperium has grown strong on ignoring truths."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","I prefer Downside to this place. The air is so … dry. And one can grow bored of bright lights."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Is this to be our existence now? Crawling in the darkness or blinded by the radioactive corona of a dying world?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Just like the Imperium to abandon something perfectly useful in the name of convenience. Has it been like this long?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","This whole place is a testament to the Imperium's carelessness. How long has it been thus?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","The heretics are welcome to it, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Let the heretics keep the wretched place, for all I care."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I shouldn’t be here. What use is my incomparable mind in the business of exterminating plagues?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Plague eradication is the business of medicae specialists, not folk such as we."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Rotten little minds in rotten little bodies. But then, so many blunts are so."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","You need to work harder at being reassuring."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","As a trading port, I imagine this place would have been crowded, at its height?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","You can barely tell this used to be a trader's port, but the signs are there, if you have the wit to see them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","I'm sure those with wealth and privilege endured the decline. They always do."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","The influential will have survived such times while the powerless perished. Such tales always repeat themselves."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_interior_01","I suppose the place has a certain … dilapidated charm."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Really? Is Morrow trying to get us all buried alive? … Of course he is."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","Ah. The fate of all bureaucracies and autocracies. Even Terra is not immune to entropy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","Hah! Gaze upon this mighty work, and behold the fate of the Administratum!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Hmmm… The cargo elevator has stopped moving. We can only hope it's in the right place."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","The cargo elevator's stopped. Did it get bored, or is it where we need it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","We should press on. I fear we will be overwhelmed down here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","Too many entrances. Too many eyes. We should make haste!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_approach_01","Oh good. We're out in the open. Everyone in Chasm Terminus can see us ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_approach_02","There's the station. I honestly thought I'd be dead by now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Just remember: I am to be protected at all costs!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","One of you is going to shoot me in the back, I just know it!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","Must you keep prattling on?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Please. Enough. Leave us to get this done."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I would like to know more about the gnarlbeast before I put my head in his mouth!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Is there anything useful you can tell us about the target?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Wonderful. Simply wonderful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","I don't know why I expected anything else."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","Ah ... A place where heretics are sought and secrets exposed. Through the medium of pain, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","I find these catechizer posts fascinating. A place where monsters seek monsters, with the innocent caught between."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","This seems an elaborate plan. Surely there were simpler methods?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","To my incomparable mind, this plan reveals much about its architect."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","And so we retreat into threats and half-truths. Typical."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","So many words to say so little of value."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","I'm not surprised we're resorting to skulduggery. Honour is sadly out of fashion."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Ambushes and shooting people in the back is a time-honoured tradition, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","And when this enemy is defeated, there will be another deserving of such treatment. I've heard it all before."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","A familiar prayer, offered by the blindly obedient."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","It would have been much more efficient to perform the splice within the station itself."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Tell me again why we had to grub around in this vile place?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Blunts always make things too complicated."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Ah, yes. Mistaking complication for efficiency. Of course."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","Ah, the military life. Go here. Do nothing. Die."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","These soldiers don't seem very industrious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_station_hall_01","Barbarism! This was once a glorious edifice!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_station_station_hall_02","This poor, slighted building. Perhaps decay is inevitable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","Squalid. Not that I am surprised."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","This isn't a dwelling, but a nest."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A daemon underfoot. What did I do to deserve this?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","A daemon is not to be taken lightly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Every day another surprise. Every day a little bit worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I aspire to that level of confidence. Truly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","This is most inefficient. Surely expelling the heretics is a more sensible course?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Why do we not simply drive the heretics out?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","I sense you'd prefer something swifter. And bloodier."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","You're impatient for something to change, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","A body could feel safe down here. Away from the enforcers' cruel gaze..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The Torrent feels like it might once have been a haven for the oppressed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","A simplistic analysis, I suspect."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Ah. Life is always more complicated than it first appears."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","A gaudy statue in the bad part of town. How has it lasted this long?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","That statue seems out of place. Then again, so do we."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","Well, I'd say that looks blocked, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","I don't think we're getting in that way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","I would watch your footing. The floors are likely as bad as the walls."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Rotten. All of it. Disgusting."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Ah, what a delightful green glow. It just screams ""please drink me"", doesn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","This is where our drinking water comes from? I think I'm going to be sick..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","When that atmospheric shield falls the wind will cut us to pieces ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","Atmospheric shield? Once, perhaps. It's more like a net these days."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_crossroads_01","I don't suppose anyone brought a map?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Reach Flow Control, they said. It'll be easy, they said."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Can't you hear it? Deep, booming thoughts flowing like molasses across oil."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","The daemon knows we're here! I can ... feel it oozing through my thoughts."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","These have not been used in some time. There must be others."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","These aren't in use. Keep searching!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Matchless efficiency on every hand. Such a delight."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","Wonderful! I do so enjoy our little chats."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","How can you be so calm! This elevator sounds ready to fall!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I have a bad feeling about this elevator ride."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Oh, don't worry. I'm sure nothing will go wrong. Truly."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Ach! What's the worst that can happen?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Slaughter is always the first solution attempted ... but in this case, I think I agree."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","True. Sanctioned or heretical, belief is so difficult to quell, is it not?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Well, I wasn't expecting to fight a daemon today. Whatever next?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Daemons. Heretics. Imbeciles. Tell me this can't get worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Thank you. You've been a big help."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","How very reassuring. And useless."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","How can you all be so calm? We're walking into a plague factory!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","We're bound to be infected. You do know that, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","Yes, very easy for you to say, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Oh, I'm so very reassured by that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","I cannot help but notice we've been told little about the pathogen."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","I wish our 'employer' was less secretive about the pathogen's nature ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Splendid. You will warn us if we're about to liquify, won't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","So it's all guesswork. How delightful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","Decay is our constant companion. Perhaps it is the fate of Mankind?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","This place's hour is long past. Twilight claims everything, sooner or later."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_01","Move, simpleton!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_02","Move, cretin!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_03","Don't just stand there!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_04","It's coming for you!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_05","It's coming!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_06","Get out of there!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_07","Run!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_08","Move!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_09","It's attacking!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_combo_attack_10","Look out!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","This will hurt."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Oh well done for finding this."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","I'm so very looking forward to this."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","I'm regretting having met any of you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Remind me again why I'm here?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","Well that's going to have to die."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","Well? After you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","So glad I came along tonight."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","Incredible. The night's getting even worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","Oh."
"loc_psyker_male_a__need_rescue_01","I suppose you're going to leave me behind?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__need_rescue_02","Don't just stand there, simpletons! Help me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__need_rescue_03","Why won't you help me? Is it because I make you feel inferior?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__need_rescue_04","Rescue! I need rescue! At once!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__need_rescue_05","Yes, yes, yes. It's thrilling lying here, waiting for someone to care ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","Do we face a single entity, or several small ones?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","I can get no sense of scale for this daemonic entity. I'd really rather not read its thoughts..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","Delightful. As expected."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","Ah, the lost art of conversation blossoms anew ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","Only a fool would expect things to get better from here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","This planet is falling into shadow and bleak laughter. Of course, I wouldn't expect a blunt to notice."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","Threatening us won't win this war."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","It was an honest observation. No need to get snippy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","It is scarcely rational to revere a god of pestilence. Hah."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","If one must offer worship, surely a benevolent god is preferable to a disease-bringer?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","Like avoiding being burned by leaping into the fire? [Sigh]"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","Well, there's no accounting for stupidity."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","Everywhere I keep hearing the same word. Nurgle, Nurgle, Nurgle."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","This name: Nurgle. It feels older than it should. Curious."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Words cannot hurt anyone. It's the actions that follow we should fear."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","Yes, on no account should we attempt to understand what we're up against."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","It beggars belief that Tertium can be rescued from its current state."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","I do not see how we can hope to purge the corruption from this hive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","Yes ... well ... I guess we'll see how it goes, won't we?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","Ah, the eternal optimism of the eternal lackey. Most encouraging."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_01","That ghastly thing is alive ... Its thoughts are bent on us ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_02","It knows we're here, that thing. It hates us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_03","That ... thing ... is aware. It reasons ... at least as much as you lot do."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_04","There is a presence here ... old ... malign ... endless ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_05","You see it, don't you? The creature in the wall?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_06","That creature ... We see only a fraction of its true form."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_07","Be glad that beast is trapped in the wall. Be glad it can't reach us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_08","The daemonic swirls close about this place ... Worse things may yet emerge ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_09","I cannot ... [Gasp] ... The pressure ... in my mind ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_10","That thing mustn't notice me ... It mustn't!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_01","Repulsive ... Truly repulsive ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_02","That is a special kind of horrible ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_03","I see the wall between the Immaterium and realspace is growing thin ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_04","It's ugly, yes. But so are many things a blunt might never see."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_05","These growths presage something terrible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_06","See that? And the infestation has barely begun."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_07","This infestation is only the beginning. This world is doomed."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_08","Atoma is benighted. The proof is all around us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_09","If you cannot imagine more repulsive sights, fear not - you will surely see them soon."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_10","These are not growths, but extrusions into our world from a seething, pustulent Hel."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_01","I can feel ... something watching that shrine ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_02","Vile energies swirl about that shrine ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_03","A presence lingers near that shrine ... We should keep moving!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_04","Stay away from that shrine!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_05","No! ... The voices ... The voices ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_06","Get out of my mind!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_07","That shrine seethes with ... something ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_08","I feel a dark and suffocating presence ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_09","Do you not feel it? Something is watching us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_10","A shrine, laden with dark forebodings ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","The air is revolting down here, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","Oh good. Sentient scenery. Sentient and toxic scenery. [Sigh]"
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","Yes ... I can feel something crawling around my mind. It's ... horrible."
"loc_psyker_male_a__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","However bad it smells, its thoughts feel worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_01","We're being cut to pieces!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_02","I'm getting shot!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_03","Should we shoot back?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_04","Too much fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_05","They have overwhelming fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_06","By the Five Rusting Spires, I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_07","The heretics have me pinned!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_08","That's right, everyone shoot at the psyker!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_09","I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__pinned_by_enemies_10","Would you mind? I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_ogryn_01","Farewell, Brute. You were tolerable."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_ogryn_02","A shame about the Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_ogryn_03","I will miss the Brute ... even if the enemy did not."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_ogryn_04","We'll need a new Ogryn now, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_ogryn_05","Ah. We seem to be short one Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_psyker_01","My Sibling deserved better!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_psyker_02","Alas for my Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_psyker_03","At least my Sibling is now free!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_psyker_04","My Sibling has the only freedom my kind can know."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_psyker_05","Farewell, Sibling. Rest easy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_veteran_01","I see the Veteran's dead."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_veteran_02","Not much of a soldier after all ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_veteran_03","Veteran's dead? Well, training can only carry you so far."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_veteran_04","Roughneck's dead? Well, live by the lasgun, die in the darkness."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_veteran_05","Oh. The Veteran's dead."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_zealot_01","Farewell, Fanatic. A sad loss."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_zealot_02","We seem to have lost a Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_zealot_03","Well, it's going to be quieter now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_zealot_04","Did the Zealot just die?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_zealot_05","No more Zealot. Oh."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_01","You're hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_02","Cretin! You're hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_03","You keep hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_04","That's armour, cretin!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_05","Stop hitting armour!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_08","I wish I could target weak points like you…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_09","Aim for the weak point!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_10","Aim where it's weak, simpleton!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__power_circumstance_start_b_01","Nothing works on this wretched world ... "
"loc_psyker_male_a__power_circumstance_start_b_02","And there I was thinking the place couldn't look more miserable. Wrong again!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__power_circumstance_start_b_03","Another example of the Imperium's peerless efficiency, hmmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__power_circumstance_start_b_04","Well, at least I probably won't see the thing that kills me."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_combat_01","Hah."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_combat_02","Not so easy to kill, am I?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_combat_03","Did that hurt?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_combat_04","How embarrassing for you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_combat_05","Oh… I'm still alive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_end_event_conversation_b_01","Yes, yes. Very heroic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_firefight_conversation_b_01","Panic and adrenaline, that's all."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_01","I am not dying in this revolting place…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_02","Oh, aren't you repulsive?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_03","Do we really have to fight? Go away."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_04","At last… a way out of this slime…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_05","All these alarms are giving me a headache…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_06","Traitors? This is getting worse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_07","Sounds like someone is having a very bad day. Still, every cloud has a diamantine lining…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_09","This ship is swarming with unattractive cretins… I should try another deck. Maybe that elevator still works?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__prologue_monologue_10","Why does this feel like a mistake?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_b_01","Are you talking to yourself again? It's starting to become ... unsettling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_d_01","Oh for--"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_macro_b_01","It's very simple: we are here to kill, and probably die."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_macro_d_01","Experience has taught me it is better to operate at a macro level. It brings clarity."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_purpose_c_01","True purpose comes from within, not from a red-faced man bellowing angrily all the time."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_quibble_a_01","Well, this is civilised. I mean, relatively speaking. There's not a blunt in sight."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_quibble_d_01","Don't quibble. It's beneath our kind."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_small_brain_b_01","It's the smaller brains, you see. If they perceived a fraction of what we behold, they'd all go mad."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_trusted_c_01","Yes, trust is relative. It may be that we are not elevated to the same level as the Blunts, but that they are reduced to ours."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_value_b_01","I'm weary of forever proving my value to people who don't care."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_weaponry_a_01","I must confess, it is nice to have access to all of this weaponry. To hold such power in one's hand ... it's delightful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_weaponry_d_01","And who says that? Those without power, hmmm? Jealousy is a terrible thing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_worse_a_01","Remember Siblings: it could always be worse!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_gang_metropolitan_worse_d_01","It's merely a simple statement of fact: it can always be worse. And probably will be."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_01","Bravo, Brute! More!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_02","I must remember not to upset the Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_03","The Brute triumphs!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_04","The Ogryn's putting us all to shame."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_05","Well done, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","You've a knack for this, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_02","Well done, Sibling. That's the way."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_03","Don't strain yourself, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_04","You've been practising, haven't you Sibling?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_05","Sibling! Don't get carried away!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_01","Well, this is their job…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_02","I've seen worse, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_03","You have a brutish efficiency, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_04","A Veteran should have a knack for killing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_05","I think they upset the Veteran."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_01","Not just a Fanatic. Also a maniac."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_02","Bloodlust isn't as attractive as you might think, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_03","Even a blunt instrument has its place, eh Zealot?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_04","Messy, Zealot. Very Messy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_05","That looks exhausting, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_01","Killed it!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_02","Killed it!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_03","It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_04","It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_05","Gone!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_06","Gone!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_07","Hush! It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_08","Hush! It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_09","Settle down, it's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_10","Settle down, it's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__ranged_gameplay_04_01","You were very clear."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_carnival_a_01","These streets have the air of pleasures thwarted and indulged. Delightful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_carnival_a_02","Another less-than-charming locale. However do we find them?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_carnival_a_03","Oh, I do like a change of scenery ... though I'm sure this place will be draped in Moebians ... just like the rest."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_habculum_01","Can you imagine living in such a place? Pfah."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_habculum_02","Ah, the Sector Habculum. All very civilised ... so long as you comply."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_habculum_03","Just when I thought this place couldn't get any bleaker..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_mechanicus_01","A death trap! How many thousands perish to keep its gears turning?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_mechanicus_02","This facility is a death trap. There are more ways to die on Atoma than at a heretic's hands."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_mechanicus_03","Another cult, another symbol. Although I concede the mechanicus has a certain style..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_periferus_01","This is a frontier. Fascism within, anarchy without. No place for honest souls. Or for us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_periferus_02","This place hasn't seen imperial rule in generations. A place apart, simply teeming … with disobedience."
"loc_psyker_male_a__region_periferus_03","The Imperium obliges citizens to live in filth like this and wonders why heresies arise?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_01","I'm out of ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_02","I need ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_03","I must find ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_04","And now I'm out of ammunition."
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_05","I must have ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_06","I cannot fight without ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_07","Out? This really is too much."
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_08","Inevitably, I'm out of ammunition."
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_09","Why is all the ammunition gone?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_10","This weapon needs more ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_01","Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_02","Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_03","I'm reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_04","Reloading this weapon!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_05","Blast! Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_empty_01","Unreliable weapon!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_empty_02","I'm out! Worthless contraption!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_empty_03","Curses! Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_empty_04","I can't shoot! Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__reloading_empty_05","Primitive toy!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__repeated_psykinetic_head_pop_a_01","Tiny minds! [Laugh]"
"loc_psyker_male_a__repeated_psykinetic_head_pop_a_02","I'm sorry, did that hurt?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__repeated_psykinetic_head_pop_a_03","No room for even the smallest thought!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__repeated_psykinetic_head_pop_a_04","Oops! Sorry!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__repeated_psykinetic_head_pop_a_05","Such a tiny vessel. Such tiny thoughts!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_01","Pray harder, Fanatic. Maybe it'll heal?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_02","Isn't suffering good for the soul, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_03","Perhaps the God-Emperor is testing you, Zealot?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_04","Don't complain so, Zealot. It's weakness."
"loc_psyker_male_a__respons_for_zealot_critical_health_05","Hush, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_01","Hush!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_02","Patience please!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_03","Very well!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_04","All right, all right, all right…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_05","What was that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_06","Eh?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_07","I'll get right on it…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_08","I'm busy!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_09","Hah!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_calling_for_help_10","Oh, I see…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_01","I heard you!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_02","Oh, I'll drop everything!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_03","Yes, I've nothing better to do!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_04","Of course I'll bail you out…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_05","And if I have my own problems?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_06","Sounds like someone needs help!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_07","Help's needed!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_08","Someone's in trouble!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_09","It's one demand after another with his cretin."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_cover_me_10","Yes, yes, yes. I'm busy."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_01","Then heal cretin, and stop bothering us."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_02","Do you always complain this much?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_03","It's 'me, me, me' with you, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_04","That does look serious…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_05","If it helps, I doubt it'll hurt that much longer…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_06","You don't look well…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_07","Perhaps… you should heal?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_08","It doesn't look fatal… Not yet…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_09","You've an excellent chance of living. Nearly 30%."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_critical_health_10","Please don't bleed on me. It's distressing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_01","That could have gone easier."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_02","You may all thank me now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_03","We are certain it's dead?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_04","That was messier than it needed to be."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_05","Let us hope that was the only one…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_06","Let's never do that again…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_07","Why did I agree to doing this?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_08","It's ugly even as a corpse."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_09","It's very slightly more attractive dead than alive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_enemy_kill_monster_10","I don't suppose we can return to base now?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_ogryn_01","It shall not happen again, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_ogryn_02","I shall take more care in future."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_ogryn_03","I wasn't aiming at you. I wasn't!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_ogryn_04","A thousand apologies, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_ogryn_05","Well ... You are quite a large target."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_psyker_01","Apologies, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_psyker_02","Me, Sibling? Well, I'm sorry. Alright?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_psyker_03","My mistake, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_psyker_04","What a cretin I've been! Apologies!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_psyker_05","Curse these sights!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_veteran_01","Oh. I'm very sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_veteran_02","What was I thinking?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_veteran_03","I must have slipped."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_veteran_04","I am distraught."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_veteran_05","Oh dear. What a pity."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_zealot_01","I fear you are mistaken."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_zealot_02","Why would I shoot you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_zealot_03","I shot you? Unthinkable!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_zealot_04","I'll have you know, I never miss my target."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_zealot_05","No, no, no. I didn't shoot you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_01","So much rage! So much fear!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_02","Well, this will be fun…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_03","I should have stayed behind…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_04","I didn't want to be here…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_05","So many voices… So many shadows…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_06","Please, let's try to survive this…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_07","I don't want to die here. It'd be embarrassing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_08","That sounds fun."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_09","Oh good."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_heard_horde_vector_10","Be still my beating heart."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_info_incoming_enemies_01","They will quail before my unparalleled mind!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_info_incoming_enemies_02","It's never quiet, is it?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_info_incoming_enemies_03","Pffffff…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_info_incoming_enemies_04","Oh, I'm so very surprised…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_info_incoming_enemies_05","Never a dull moment…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_cover_me_01","Brute's calling for covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_cover_me_02","The Brute needs covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_cover_me_03","You do make a big target, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_cover_me_05","Can anyone cover the Ogryn?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_critical_health_01","The Brute doesn't look good…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_critical_health_02","The Brute looks worse than normal…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_critical_health_03","Bind that wound, Ogryn. While you can."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_critical_health_04","Treat that wound, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_critical_health_05","No one's impressed by a corpse, Ogryn. Heal up."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Good choice. Lots of eating on an Ogryn…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","The Ogryn's been pounced!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Get that Hound off the Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","Brute, meet Hound…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","Someone help the Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_01","The Brute has found trouble…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_02","Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_03","Ogryn?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_04","Are you in need, Ogryn?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_05","What happened to you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_06","The Ogryn got careless!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_07","That could have gone better, eh Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_08","So much for physical might."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_09","Strength is nothing without a mind to guide it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_disabled_by_enemy_10","Brute force doesn't solve everything, then?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_enemy_kill_monster_01","I'm impressed, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_enemy_kill_monster_02","One monster to kill another, eh?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_enemy_kill_monster_03","A Brute should always be apt to slaughter."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_enemy_kill_monster_04","Remind me not to offend you, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_enemy_kill_monster_05","Brutal, but effective. I approve."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_knocked_down_3_01","The Ogryn's down!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_knocked_down_3_02","I know! I felt the ground shake!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_knocked_down_3_03","I hope you didn't land on someone!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_knocked_down_3_04","Who can reach the Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_knocked_down_3_05","Hold on, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_01","Help the Ogryn up!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_02","You need help, Ogryn?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_03","Drag Brute to safety!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_04","Need a hand up, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_05","Hanging around, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_06","What are you doing down there, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_07","You were careless, Brute…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_08","Don't slip, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_09","That doesn't look comfortable, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_ledge_hanging_10","Hold on, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_revive_01","Aren't you strong?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_revive_02","Careful! Clumsy Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_revive_03","Yes, yes, yes. Quickly now!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_revive_04","Thank you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_revive_05","I suppose I owe you now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","Charmed, I'm sure, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_seen_killstreak_psyker_02","What else did you expect?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_seen_killstreak_psyker_03","Please, Brute. This was nothing."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_seen_killstreak_psyker_04","Such adulation. I'm thrilled."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_ogryn_seen_killstreak_psyker_05","Am I not glorious?"

"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_zealot_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","There's good eating on a priest…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_zealot_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","The Hound's desperate. I wouldn't eat that…"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_zealot_disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","Stop screaming, Zealot. Someone will save you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_zealot_disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","Watch out for the teeth, Fanatic!"

"loc_psyker_male_a__zone_tank_foundry_01","So this is where they treat humans as objects on this world. How bleak and unsurprising..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__zone_tank_foundry_02","See how they value the machines more than the workers? A proud tradition in the Imperium."

"loc_psyker_male_a__zone_transit_02","The Imperium failed the people who lived in this place."
"loc_psyker_male_a__zone_transit_03","Bleak? Depressing? Almost an improvement by Atoma's standards..."

"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_04","Just the tiniest bit of pressure!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_05","Did you see that? I did that!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_shards_chain_a_01","Oh, I do like giving out presents."
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_shards_chain_a_02","So many shards, so little time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_shards_chain_a_03","There's something very satisfying about this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_shards_chain_a_04","No Beloved, we should only kill the heretics."
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_shards_chain_a_05","These heretics don't catch things very well at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_smite_chain_a_01","Crackle, crackle, crackle, zap!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_smite_chain_a_02","Zap! ... Oh, that does feel good."
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_smite_chain_a_03","Bzzzzzzzz!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_smite_chain_a_04","Zap! Zap zap zap!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__blitz_smite_chain_a_05","Can anyone else smell charred flesh?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_anger_a_01","You’re always so angry … It must be exhausting."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_anger_c_01","No, no, no. You can’t fool me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_anger_e_01","Not yet! My Beloved says that what happened to Cadia wasn’t your fault. He wants you to know that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_psy_b_c_01","I'm exceptional too. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_psy_b_e_01","Why thank you. I like that we're friends."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_lessons_b_01","I don't know. That feels like it’d be quite unsporting."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_lessons_d_01","Well, if you suppose I should … The problem is, I’m not allowed a gun on the Mourningstar. Or sharp objects."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_like_b_01","Thank you, Sweet Brute. That's very kind. I like you too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_like_d_01","Oh ... Very well then. I hate you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_boot_b_01","Why of course you do, otherwise however would you put it on?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_boot_d_01","Well why didn't you say so?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_camellid_a_01","It's really not fair. You keep shooting people before I can do unspeakable things to them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_camellid_c_01","It's not a conversation, it's an instruction. Stop doing it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_centre_attention_a_01","No Beloved, she's not really trying, is she? Someone ought to put her through her paces."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_centre_attention_c_01","Well, sort of. I'm mostly listening. My Beloved's doing all the talking. You know, he really does like to be the centre of attention. I don't think it's healthy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_centre_attention_e_01","Oh no. Not at all. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_compelling_a_01","You can't hear my Beloved, can you sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_compelling_c_01","Oh, you really should. So many pearls of wisdom are passing you by."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_compelling_e_01","I'm not sure that's a compelling argument."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_contest_b_01","Oh yes, Brute. I'm sure it's very impressive."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_contest_d_01","Not everything has to be a contest, you know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_cosy_soul_b_01","Oh, so you do like me after all. I thought so, but I wasn't sure."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_cosy_soul_d_01","Protest all you like, I can see what's in your soul."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_cosy_soul_f_01","But it's so cosy in here. I could just curl up and go to sleep. [Snore]"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_crook_b_01","Oh, I'm sure he's nothing of the sort. It's not as though the Inquisition recruits unscrupulous ne'er do wells ... I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_crook_d_01","Yes, that makes a lot of-- Hey! Now that was very unkind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedicated_beloved_b_01","I'm not following. What ""act"" are we talking about?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedicated_beloved_d_01","Oh that? Sorry, that's real. Really, really, real. My Beloved does talk to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedicated_beloved_f_01","Oh thank you, that is nice. I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_disappear_a_01","I do want to be your friend, you know ... Only I have to be careful. Something terrible happened to my last friend."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_disappear_c_01","No ... He disappeared."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_disappear_e_01","He said something very unkind about my Beloved and then ... I don't exactly remember."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_disappear_g_01","That's very kind. He'll like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eyeballs_b_01","Oh, that is nice. I think ... It is meant to be nice?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eyeballs_d_01","I don't see why you had to bring eyeballs into this. I was being perfectly civil."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fingers_b_01","I think so ... Although it's a little bit hard to tell because I can't feel my fingers."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fingers_d_01","Oh, never mind. They weren't my fingers at all. I was only imagining them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_flay_b_01","Really? ... That's not what you said yesterday."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_flay_d_01","""I'll flay ye alive, accursed Freak"" you said. It was very hurtful."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_floating_a_01","Your brain is so strange. It floats on a cloud of [Sniffs] alcohol."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_floating_c_01","Oh, I'm not prying. You're practically screaming for help. It's very distracting."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fly_a_01","You seem downhearted, sweet Brute. Whatever is wrong?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fly_c_01","Oh dear, that's not very kind of her. Would you like me to have a word?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fly_e_01","I can be very, very [darkly] very persuasive. Can't I, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friends_a_01","I have decided that you and I shall be friends. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_friends_c_01","Don't be silly. Of course you do! At least, if I hadn't already decided."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_in_the_moment_b_01","Oh no, but thank you anyway. It's just my Beloved ... and of course all those nasty little self doubts of yours."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_influence_a_01","No Beloved, I don't want to bother him. He looks busy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_influence_c_01","Oh, nothing really. My Beloved just wants us to work together more. He says we can be good influences on one another."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_influence_e_01","Not my way. My Beloved's way."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_inside_out_a_01","You're looking at me strangely again. I feel sure I've told you that I don't like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_inside_out_c_01","No Beloved, I don't think she's being very nice either ... What's that? I'm allowed to turn her inside out? That seems a little extreme."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_jokes_b_01","Me? Oh, I almost never get bored. If I do, my Beloved tells me a joke."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_jokes_d_01","Oh, you wouldn't like these. Truth be told, he's not very funny ... but that's not the worst part."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_jokes_f_01","Almost everyone else thinks he's being serious. He's such a scamp."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_little_things_b_01","I was just admiring the view. It's important to savour the little things. You never know when they might be gone."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_little_things_d_01","Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't let anything bad happen to me. My Beloved wouldn't like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_locked_door_a_01","Zola's hiding something, did you know that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_locked_door_c_01","Yes, that does sound like fun. Only ... I don't think Zola knows that she's hiding something. Which is very strange."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_locked_door_e_01","Yes, yes, yes. I just told you that. Do pay attention."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mallard_a_01","Your thoughts are troubled, Roughneck. Would you like me to fix that for you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mallard_c_01","Oh, I didn't mean that. I was offering to change your thoughts. I could make you much more positive. Or I could make you quack like a sprinx mallard. It'd be no bother."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_name_b_01","I don't know, Brute. Does Morrow know your name?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_name_d_01","My Beloved says he doesn't learn anyone's name for at least three months. Not worth it, apparently."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_name_f_01","Most of us don't make it that far. Still, mustn't grumble!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_no_thinking_a_01","I like you. You've got lots of energy. It's invigorating."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_no_thinking_c_01","Maybe you should think less. Live in the moment. My Beloved agrees."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pain_a_01","My Beloved says you don't mean to be so cruel. You were just raised by an uncaring and hypocritical system."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pain_c_01","Well ... I may have embellished a bit to cut out all the screaming. I think my Beloved's in a lot of pain most of the time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_philosophy_a_01","No, no, no, Beloved. She's one of the good ones. I couldn't possibly do that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_philosophy_c_01","Yes thank you! Just a philosophical difference of opinion."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_philosophy_e_01","Erm ... No, probably not."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pithy_a_01","You are an Ogryn of very few words."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pithy_c_01","Bordering on pithy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_point_of_view_b_01","I'm really not sure I ought to talk about that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_point_of_view_d_01","I think it probably depends on your point of view."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_point_of_view_f_01","Bad. Very, very bad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sefoni_a_01","Oh, I do wish Sefoni could come with us. She always seems so lonely."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sefoni_c_01","It's very lovely of you to say so. I like you too ... Most of the time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sides_b_01","Me? Oh, that's easy. I'm on my Beloved's side."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sides_d_01","He hasn't decided about you yet, but I'm sure you'll be the first to know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_small_brain_a_01","It is nice that we're fighting together again, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_small_brain_c_01","Oh no, I don't think so. Honestly, who has the time to even look for something that small?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smell_of_heresy_b_01","Oh, I think that might be me, sorry. I haven't had time to wash the blood out of my clothes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smell_of_heresy_d_01","But I feel safer here. "
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soothing_blood_b_01","Oh, I'm sure we have. Then again, it's hard to tell. Everything looks the same down here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soothing_blood_d_01","Oh no, I don't think so. I find it very soothing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_spoil_b_01","I'm sure he does, but he won't tell me no matter how often I ask. He doesn't want to spoil things."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_spoil_d_01","Oh yes! He always has our best interests at heart. You'll see."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tall_a_01","You must get very dizzy, being so tall."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tall_c_01","You know, I don't think I'd ever really noticed. I think I'm exactly the size I need to be."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tancred_a_01","What are you thinking about, Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tancred_c_01","That's not a very positive outlook. My Beloved's very disappointed in you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tired_a_01","Would you mind carrying me the rest of the way, Sweet Brute? I'm very tired."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tired_c_01","I suppose we can't have that. I'd better trudge on."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_very_hurt_a_01","Oh this is fun! I wonder if I can do some more of it when I wake up?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_very_hurt_c_01","Well no one did ask you, did they? What's that, Beloved? You asked her? Without telling me first. I'm very hurt."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wax_b_01","Oh yes! I only wish the air smelled a bit nicer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wax_d_01","That's so very true. But at least it's a bit unusual. Not like the Mourningstar, where everything is oil, wax and hot metal."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_advice_b_01","I'm not sure. He's been very quiet. No ... wait ... there was something about heretics. No, it's gone."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_advice_d_01","Do you think so? Oh, I'm so pleased."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_family_b_01","Thank you, Sweet Brute I'm sure--"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_family_d_01","That's very touching."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_family_f_01","That is nice. I feel safe all of a sudden."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_07_b_01","And all Fanatics should not speak until spoken to ... But I suppose I can overlook it, so long as you don't burn me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_squirrel_b_01","Yes, I know. It's very distracting. Sometimes I'm trying to murder a filthy heretic, and then ... ptera-squirrel!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_squirrel_d_01","Yes. What? Where?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_squirrel_f_01","No, I don't think so. I'm sure I'd remember that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_voices_a_01","If the voices start to take over, you will ... stop them, won't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_voices_c_01","Oh not him. He's a good voice. I mean the bad voices. The ones that tell me to tear down the walls of reality and set fire to everything that remains."
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_01","No!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_02","Aaargh!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_03","Aaaaah!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_04","Help! Help! HELP!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_05","Beloved aid me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_06","Help me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_07","No! Please! Someone?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_08","Someone?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_09","Help! I… HELP!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__calling_for_help_10","No. No. No. No. No."

"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_a_01","I've been hunted before. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_a_02","Yes Beloved. Hunted again. It's not fair."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_b_01","I wish you hadn't said that. I'm getting some terrible flashbacks."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_hunted_b_02","Why did you have to remind me? I was trying to forget."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_b_01","You see, I thought that, but I was afraid you'd all laugh at me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_b_02","Even I know that! Does that mean I'm getting better at this?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_b_01","Oh, those poor dogs. Are you sure there isn't another way?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_hound_b_02","I suppose it's necessary. I don't want to be eaten."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_b_01","Yes ... my dream has grown a little indistinct."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_b_02","I think it's sort of beautiful. Like an unformed memory ... or a fading emotion."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_b_01","Speaking as the sort you used to hunt, I'm cheering for the Hounds."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_b_02","Yes Beloved, you do have an amusing sense of justice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_gas_b_01","You don't sound very sure. Are you worried?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_gas_b_02","Oh, I'm sure I wouldn't dream something toxic ... I mean, apart from all those other things."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_06_b_01","Why thank you, Sweet Brute. I shall bear that in mind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_07_b_01","That will make a terrible mess. How thrilling."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_09_b_01","Oh, I'm never scared. I generally proceed directly to ""terrified""."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_13_b_01","I know ... It tingles, doesn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_14_b_01","There's no need to pretend, you know. I won't think less of you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_01_b_01","I like medals. And trophies. Eyeballs, fingers ... afterimages of terror ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_04_b_01","Oh, I don't know. No ... No ... You're right. It'll all have to go."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_07_b_01","Oh, I never do. Somehow I always seem to be here anyway."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_12_b_01","But this is fun, Sweet Brute. Isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_16_b_01","No one's contesting that. I mean ... look at me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_17_b_01","So you keep saying. It's not like anyone's arguing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_01_b_01","My Beloved knows the quickest way to a Brute's heart..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_04_b_01","I try not to think about what my mortal shell endures."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_07_b_01","My Beloved told me what's in our rations. You can have mine."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_12_b_01","Sweet Brute... I think there is a thirst you can never quench. So sad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_16_b_01","It's probably a whole colony. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_17_b_01","That's really not what my Beloved meant. But you wouldn't understand."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_20_b_01","My Beloved says the true weapon is within us. Or maybe he only meant me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_02_b_01","So was I! At least, that's what my Beloved tells me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_05_b_01","Oh, I don't mind. I'm always useful."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_10_b_01","Mine too! I suppose that's why it's a dream, not a nightmare."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_b_01","I'm still not sure I like the killing. But it's certainly colourful."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_20_b_01","Oh yes. They're all treacle-y, and covered with some kind of ... I want to say ""slime""?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_01_a_01","Oh, I really don't like this ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_02_a_01","Are we lost? I feel like we're lost."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_02_b_01","You might be lost. I know exactly where I am."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_03_a_01","My dream really is a miserable place, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_04_a_01","How much longer is this going to take?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_05_a_01","I do hope you'll protect me during the next attack."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_05_b_01","I'll certainly try, Sibling. Perhaps you should stay close to me?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_06_a_01","No, Beloved. Something about this isn't right."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_a_01","Beloved? I don't think I like this dream very much."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_08_a_01","You are there, aren't you Beloved? It's ever so hard to hear your voice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_09_a_01","Beloved? You'll have to speak up. I can't hear you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_10_a_01","Everything's fallen into decay. Then again, everything always does."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_10_b_01","Rotting, rotting, rotting. It's the fate that awaits us all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_a_01","I think I'd like to wake up now ... Oh, if only it were that easy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_b_01","I'd rather stay sleeping, if it's all the same to you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_12_a_01","I never knew a dream could smell so bad, or sound so loud."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_13_a_01","Oh, I do enjoy your company. I wish you were all real."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_14_a_01","A medicognisant once told me I was delusional, can you believe that? So I made him go away."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_15_a_01","My dream is better with heretics to shoot. It's ... soothing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_16_a_01","It's the waiting I don't like. Knowing they're out there ... Watching me ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_17_a_01","People keep telling me I'm creepy. You don't think I'm creepy, do you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_18_a_01","Violence can be so beautiful. I think we should make some more."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_19_a_01","Murder can be such fun! I wish I'd known earlier."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_20_a_01","If nothing else, death and destruction make for an entertaining dream ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_20_b_01","But it gives me nightmares. How does one get nightmares in a dream? That's worrying."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_02_b_01","Sibling, I do see it as you do. We're the same, you and I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_05_b_01","Who can our kind rely on, sibling, if not each other?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_10_b_01","Sweet sibling... If it's any consolation, My Beloved is very sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_b_01","No, but I can just suck it directly out of their minds. Almost as good."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_20_b_01","I like to steer clear of Enforcers. Force of habit."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_b_01","Don't worry about it. I don't really aim, and I'm still enjoying myself!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_b_01","That is good news. And bad news. Maybe stick to the good news in future?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_10_b_01","Humanity is destined to destroy itself. I don't like to think about it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_11_b_01","I'm doing my best, thank you very much!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_18_b_01","I promise not to be parted from it! At least, not while I have my strength!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_20_b_01","I thought it was gratuitously unfair odds that won wars? That and ruthlessness."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","Yes, I'm certain I don't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_b_01","I've certainly got some ideas if you don't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_10_b_01","Oh, I'm sure there'll be another opportunity ... if we survive."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_11_b_01","Most of them aren't even lurking. They're running, screaming, dying ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_18_b_01","I'll certainly try, but I do find it all a bit barbaric."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_20_b_01","Oh yes. I mean ... We certainly don't have the numbers, so something must be in our favour."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_b_01","I'll have you know I'm perfectly trustworthy. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_b_01","I do hope you're not talking about me ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_10_b_01","You seem agitated, Roughneck. Have you been getting enough sleep?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_11_b_01","Oh, you do have a way with words, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_18_b_01","Just so long as they're not, you know, haunting us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_20_b_01","Yes, Beloved, they are very driven aren't they?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_02_b_01","It's not the darkness I mind, but the terrible things lurking within. They have teeth."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_05_b_01","But I don't want to be a hammer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_11_b_01","That's the best kind of promise! One that no one can prove you didn't fulfil!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_15_b_01","Yes, my Beloved is very cross with some of them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_18_b_01","That doesn't sound at all fair."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_20_b_01","Oh, indeed. If they reject my Beloved there's no saving them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_02_b_01","Oh, it's only a dream. You can't really die here. Well, I can't anyway."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_05_b_01","The good part is, you'll never know either way. Isn't that nice?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_11_b_01","That does sound nice. For us, I mean. Not for them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_15_b_01","Are you sure? I mean, you don't look particularly well-rewarded."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_18_b_01","Then you must be the cleanest soul on all Atoma. That's nice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_20_b_01","Well then ... after you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_02_b_01","My Beloved appreciates the sentiment, but he says the guns help too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_04_b_01","Are you sure? My Beloved thinks my greatest weapon is the fathomless Empyrean."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_10_b_01","Oh dear... I just had a look, and I'm afraid you have quite a way to go."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_14_b_01","My Beloved says you're going the wrong way."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_17_b_01","That depends on your point of view."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_19_b_01","My Beloved really isn't so keen on these vulgar displays, you know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Oh Beloved, have you forsaken me?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_02","I'd like to wake up now, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_03","I'm sure I've done all this before."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Is my dream repeating itself? I can't tell any longer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_05","I sense hatred out in the darkness."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_06","There is a great shadow descending upon Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_07","I do hope this ends well."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_08","Morrow will be cross if we fail, so we'd better not."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_09","I'm starting to enjoy this ... I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_one_liner_10","There is no lasting victory to be had on Atoma. What a shame."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","Sweet Brute, it means you are special!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","It means that when I dreamt you, I made you very special."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","Oh ... I was supposed to be aiming?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","I don't worry about things like that. My Beloved handles it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","That sounds unfortunate. Is there nothing to be done?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","My Beloved says you should aim more and shoot less."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Oh ... I need ammunition too ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Did you just take all the ammunition again?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","My Beloved says you should share the ammunition."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","I didn't mean to. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Oh. I'm afraid I wasn't paying attention."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Might I suggest deep, calming breaths? Or murder. Murder works too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","Let it out, Fanatic. You'll feel better."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","There's always something horrible up ahead, isn't there?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","I don't know what else you expected. We are steeped in darkness."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","That seems drastic. At least, I think so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","But you wouldn't be ""you"" any longer. And I like ""you""."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Don't worry, sweet Brute. It won't be long."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","You remember that talk we had about patience, hmm?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","That doesn't seem right, sweet Brute. I mean ... look at you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","You don't need to pretend, you know. That looks like it hurts."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Oh, I'm sure it'll get worse. This dream is very strange."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","Hush, sweet Brute. Enjoy the moment. It won't last."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","When your hobby becomes your duty, you never work a day in your life..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","Glad you're having fun, but could you ask them to keep the screaming down?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","I can dream it warmer if you like? ... Though it's plenty warm already."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","I thought it was warm. In fact it's making me sleepy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_a_01","You know, I think I'm getting the hang of this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_a_02","Companions? I feel like I'm finally contributing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_a_03","I'm definitely getting better at this whole ""murdering"" thing, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","My Beloved says he's very impressed. So am I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","I wish I had your confidence."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","They dwell in darkness. They're infected by it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","You're asking me to pick a side? My Beloved thinks that's sweet."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_a_01","I don't like the quiet. The dead scream all the louder."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_a_02","So many plaintive, dead voices. I wish they'd all be quiet!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_a_03","Will someone tell the dead to stop pestering me? I'm trying to think!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","My Beloved says death isn't so bad, if you can stand the pain."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","When I die, I go the light of My Beloved. You, on the other hand..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","I know. I think it sounds pretty. I like pretty things."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Maybe we should make friends with them? I'd like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","You've told this story before, sweet Brute. Or... Did I dream of it tomorrow?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","I'm glad you've found something to aspire to, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","Don't worry, I'm sure my Beloved will save you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","So you are afraid of something, Fanatic? Well, well."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","I don't think that's a very good idea."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","I'm not sure you can escape my dream. It'd be cheating."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","My Beloved says that there are many calls on the Imperium's martial purse. Whatever that means."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","I suppose I could try dreaming some more warriors up for you, but it might not work."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","I am trying my best, you know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","I'm not sure I'm cut out for this life."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","I like them, Sibling. They have ... charm."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","Explosions give me a headache."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","My Beloved has seen Hel. He says we really don't want to go there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","My Beloved has held back the tide for so long. He's so very tired."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_a_01","What if I'm not dreaming? Or that I'm the one being dreamt of?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_a_02","Oh ... I had a terrible thought. What if I'm the dream, not the dreamer?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_a_03","Companions ... I am dreaming this aren't I? It's not one of you dreaming me?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","That's right! I knew you'd get it eventually!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Don't worry, Sibling. I won't dream anything unpleasant for you. Well, maybe."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","I'm afraid my dream is strictly teetotal. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","What a curious person you are, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","My Beloved is splendid, isn't he?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","You hear that, Beloved? He's talking about you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","I haven't decided yet. I prefer to let the dream take me where it will."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","I don't believe in absolutes ... Oh, that was an absolute wasn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","Evil spreads faster than kindness. I've never understood why."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Most of our foes are just seeking hope. Desperation blinds them to the truth."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_a_01","My Beloved says this war will never end. It will only change form."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_a_02","There is no respite in this war. There is only strife everlasting."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_a_03","I have dreamed of endless war. There is no escaping it. Sorry!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","We are all corpses in the making."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Death waits for us all. And he's very impatient."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","I'm not expendable, thank you. You can't have my dream without me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","The galaxy will not miss any of us. It's a simple truth, I'm afraid."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Yes, feet are always a problem."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Well, your toes are rather large."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","You are not burning down my dream!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Fire is nothing but aggressive entropy. There's nothing magnificent about it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","It's all right, sweet Brute. Just stay close to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Oh, we all forget things sometimes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_a_01","Just think. What we see is mirrored across a thousand, thousand worlds. So much suffering. [Laugh]"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_a_02","The Imperium began in blood. It is sustained by blood. And it will drown in blood. [Laugh]"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_a_03","There is no victory in this war, just a feast of misery, feeding on itself. [Laugh]"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","That's not very funny."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","[Laugh] I know. It's horrible!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Oh, I like you too. But then I dreamed you up, so I should, shouldn't I?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","Oh, how nice. So we are friends?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Oh Brute, there are things down here you really shouldn't eat..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Sometimes I think you're just my dream, but would I really dream of... that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","They are pitiable, aren't they? Screaming souls trapped in rotting bodies."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","I don't like them either. I don't think anyone does."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","I don't think you should be wasting that ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","I agree, Beloved. That was very wasteful."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","You should be more careful with our medicae supplies."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Sorry! Medicae is for real people. Not dreams."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","I saw it first. That's fair. That's how it works."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","Is there something wrong with my dream? Perhaps I should change it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","But you are home, sweet Brute. You belong here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","Actually, My Beloved thinks your songs are quite depressing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","I sing to him all the time… Just not out loud."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","You are very noisy. Can't you stop?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","No no no no no. I like it quiet."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","You are a monster, aren't you, sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Oh look! He's happy. Sort of."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Oh yes. I'd like that!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Of course, sweet brute! Lead on! I shall follow!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","I think I would have liked it here, before the dark came."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","My Beloved says it's hard to dream here, so far from the open sky."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_a_01","I feel so lonely. It's not as though any of you are real."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_a_02","It's hard, you know, being the only real person in a dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_a_03","You do know that you're not real, don't you? I'm all alone."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","I don't know what you mean. You're part of my dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","No. I'm sorry. My dream. My rules."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","That sounds like an awful lot of work."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","I think there might be something wrong with you ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","My Beloved thinks I could be a saint. Sometimes I think he doesn't know me at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Messelina says she appreciates the thought, but would rather not have been put to the sword."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","I'm treated even worse ... I see how you all look at me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","My Beloved adores you, Sibling. Never fear!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","My Beloved says Tertium is without feeling ... because it's a thing, not a person."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Nothing lasts forever. Not even my Beloved ... but don't let him hear you say that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","I'm sure expertise counts for more than sheer size, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","I think you're doing very well with what you have."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","Oh dear, Beloved. He doesn't seem happy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","I don't like stairs, Brute. It means effort."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","It is true. My Beloved is rather happy with our progress."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","Some of us will be rewarded in the end, certainly."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","He says you're welcome."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","No thank you, I already spoke to him today."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","My Beloved says there isn't really time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Just enjoy the quiet. I know I am."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Sometimes my dream is a little unruly. Perhaps it's that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","I don't know, and my Beloved refuses to answer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","If I get hungry, I eat your thoughts."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","We'll all be combat rations one day."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Oh! Hello! Are you in my head? I wondered what tickled."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","Prying isn't very polite. You'll upset my Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Oh, don't take on so. I like you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","Intelligence is overrated. That's what my parents always told me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","I'd like that. I think I'd like that, anyway."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","I do hope you are right. Everything looks so miserable right now."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","I'm already asleep, remember? This is all a dream. My dream. Not yours."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","Ah, but without industry, do we even have purpose? And if we've no purpose, do we exist?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","I don't really know any songs. Or rhymes. Now I'm sad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Singing? No. We don't have any of that in my dream. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Oh dear. I don't think it's wise to rest here, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","I'm sleepy too. No. Wait. I'm asleep. It's not the same thing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Their distance is psychosis, you see. Unable to connect with others, they kill."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Their laser sights are very pretty. I think I'd like one."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","You're very undignified, did you know that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Beloved, would you mind soothing our shouty friend? He's getting on my nerves."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","I can be sneaky, if you'd like?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","I fear we haven't the training for that. Or any training at all, in my case."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","It is a bit of an eye opener, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","It's just sweat rinsing away our dead flesh. I don't what the problem is."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","That sounds splendid, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","You are sure that's a good idea, sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","My Beloved would agree, if it weren't for all the heretics."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","In my dreams, Tertium is a rotting carcass, crawling with maggots."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_a_01","Don't you think we'd achieve more if we worked together? I mean, properly."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_a_02","We'd do better to work as a team. You know ... support one another?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_a_03","We really should attempt to get on better. We might live longer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","Oh yes. Let's be friends. I could use some friends."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","That's a good point. Survival is forged from common cause."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","I don't like them either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","They are lost. So lost they can't even see where they left the path."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","There is no justice in this life, only degrees of suffering."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","You'll forgive me if I don't find you wholly convincing?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","You do know none of this is real, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","Oh, is this a game? I like games. As long as I'm winning."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","Don't worry, Beloved, we'll always have each other..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","Oh, if only you'd seen what I've seen..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","No, Beloved, I don't think the Roughneck trusts anyone."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","I sense you'll have real traitors to worry about quite soon..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realise this was a test."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","I don't have to be a proper soldier. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","That's very inspiring. At least ... I'm very inspired."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","Oh yes! ... Wait, what are we doing?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","My weapons are dirty because everything is dirty here. It's horrible."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","I was going to clean them, but then I realised I didn't want to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","I don't think My Beloved is in a forgiving mood today. Best not test him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","I hold no secrets from My Beloved. From you, however…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Of course my Beloved is here. He always is."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","Isn't that nice, Beloved? Other people can see you too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","You don't look that wounded!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","You do look a little off-colour. Almost human, in fact."
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_01","You shouldn't wander off…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_02","Why are you leaving?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_03","Where are you going?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_04","You really should stay with us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_05","Don't leave. You might get hurt."
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_06","Beloved, how do I make them stay nearby?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_07","No, Beloved, I don't think it's a good idea for them to wander."
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_08","Stay with us!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_09","Please stay here!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__come_back_to_squad_10","My dream ends badly for you if you wander off."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","I'm sure I dreamed up other warriors to protect this world. I wish they were here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","My Beloved says you're not being truthful. He's very disappointed in you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","My Beloved keeps whispering of the 'Cicatrix Maledictum', but never explains (he's like that sometimes). What is it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Would you mind saying that again?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","My Beloved's curious... He wants to know if we've put my dream right yet."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","This city's all so vast and empty. It's swallowed us up. We might never again see the sky..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","When are we going to the other hive city? The bad one that everyone pretends is lost?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","I think it's trying to be friendly!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","Beloved! It won't die!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","My Beloved says we should attack from behind!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Hit it from behind, that's what my Beloved says!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","Oh, you do take the fun out of things."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Look, whose dream is this anyway?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","Do you find Explicator Zola terrifying? Or is it just me?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Explicator Zola seems nice ... and then she doesn't. It's very strange."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","My Beloved says she is more loyal to us than she seems."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She is conflicted about Atoma. Love and hate, all tangled up."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","She's strange ... but everything in my dream is strange."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","I hope she stays friendly ... I would hate for anything bad to happen to her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","My Beloved says the explicator once called Atoma her home."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","The explicator once lived on Atoma. I'm sure of it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Of course I already knew that. It is my dream, after all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Oh ... I'd keep that close. I don't think she likes being the subject of gossip."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","My Beloved said the same, but I didn't believe him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Does that mean you're going to be friends?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","She's so lucky to have found it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","Isn't she lucky to have found something so valuable? I'm sure it's genuine. Truly."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","She's very loud, isn't she? The pilot. Is she ... all right?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I like the pilot. She's not so serious as the others."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I hear her soul singing sometimes ... when it's not weeping."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","She's so strange. Happy and sad, all at once."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","No, Beloved. I won't look at her thoughts. I'll get in trouble."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Oh ... Can we walk to the next mission?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_01","Fellows! You'll never believe what I beheld earlier today!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_02","You'll never guess what I saw!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_03","I want to tell you something, but you'll never believe it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_01_04","I saw something incredible! My Beloved says you'll not believe me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","Ooh! Oh! How many guesses do I get?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Was it a Thamaxian prism stallion?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_01","Our esteemed pilot physically remonstrated with the quartermaster. Successfully."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_02","Fisticuffs! Pilot-lady against the quartermaster. She won."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_03","The quartermaster upset Pilot-lady, so she upset him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_03_04","Pilot-lady laid out the quartermaster. With her bare hands!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","Really? I keep wanting to do that, but Rannick says I mustn't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Are they really telling the truth, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_01","It's true, I swear. One punch. Smack. Drop."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_02","He hit the floor so hard."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_03","... and then she kicked him in the head! Something went crunch."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_05_04","I wonder if she'll teach me how it's done?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","Have I done something to offend you? I'm sure I didn't mean to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","Oh. You look cheerful. I do hope it's nothing embarrassing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Foolish, foolish, Roughneck..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Some people never learn, do they?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","This isn't working! What do we do?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","Why won't it die? It needs to die!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Maybe you should hit it in the head?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Ooh! Ooh! Maybe if we shoot the Plague Ogryn in the head?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","That does sound fun."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","If only it'd stop moving around ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_01","The sergeant's soul hangs heavy. Old names echo around his thoughts."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_02","Whenever the sergeant's talking to us, he's thinking about others ... dead others."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_03","The sergeant's thoughts are thick with memories of the dead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_01_04","Strange ... Even when the sergeant's talking to us, he's thinking about the dead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","Yes ... I've observed this. A litany of names. Almost like a prayer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","I think we remind him of old comrades ... Is that bad? I think it might be."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","Do you suppose we might cheer him up? No. That won't work, will it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","That's funny. His name's Morrow, but he lives in the past! It is funny, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","Does anyone else find the sergeant a bit ... unhappy?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","I don't like the way the sergeant regards me. I've seen that look before."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","He worries about what's happening on Atoma. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","My Beloved says he's worried about Atoma. He thinks we're delaying the inevitable."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Better keep that to yourself ... You wouldn't want him to hear it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","You're certain he can't hear us right now?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","That's a pretty name. What happened there?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","I don't think I know that one. Should I?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","I see ... So you think Morrow was working for the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","Morrow was there? He should be dead. Was he working for the Inquisitor, do you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","My Beloved says Morrow is much older than he seems."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow's body is in its prime, but his soul is old. Parchment-thin and translucent. It's ... ugly."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Maybe he's not human? Maybe none of us are? ... Oh."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","You never know ... He might not be human."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","I can ask my Beloved. He'll know what happened. He knows everything."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Maybe that's why he's so angry?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","The Tech-Priest ... she is a little strange, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","Does no one else find the Tech-Priest ... a little curious?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","There's a space in my dream where she should be ... but I can't see her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","Her thoughts are like the grinding of gears ... I wonder what would happen if I stopped them?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","If she does turn out to be evil ... I can always unmake her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","I'm almost certain she means well."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","I don't have to take part. My Beloved said so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Oh ... Are you all right? Your aura's gone all funny ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","My Beloved says he agrees with you. He also says you should be nicer to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","Don't be foolish. This is my dream. Not his."
"loc_psyker_male_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Why do you talk that way, Fanatic?"

And songs to warm the heart and lighten the soul. I like songs. But there isn’t any music in this dream. Everything’s loud, and angry, and has sharp teeth. My Beloved insists that I am not to worry. That the dream, and everything within it, will unfold precisely as it should. I’m sure it will."

"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_2_05","I still need help. Truly."
"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_3_01","I suppose I'll just lie here and die, then…"

"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_ogryn_04","Oh, the poor Brute…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_ogryn_05","Someone should really teach the Brute to duck…"

"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_psyker_03","You shouldn't keep falling over, Sibling."

"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_veteran_05","Are you intoxicated, Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_zealot_01","Yes, the Zealot is clumsy, Beloved…"

"loc_psyker_male_b__ladder_sighted_04","Yes, Beloved. A ladder!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__ladder_sighted_05","Oh look! A ladder!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__ladder_sighted_06","Are we using the ladder?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__ladder_sighted_07","It's a ladder. How nice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__ladder_sighted_08","It's a ladder. I thought so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__ladder_sighted_09","Ladder over here!"

"loc_psyker_male_b__ledge_hanging_08","It's a long way down…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__ledge_hanging_09","Help! I don't want to go down there!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__ledge_hanging_10","Hello? Can someone help me back up?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_01","They're so small. How do folk live like this?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_02","Too many locked doors. Too easy to be trapped when the witchseekers come."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_response_01","I don't like it in here. Can we leave?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_apartments_response_02","Yes, Beloved. So much suffering within these walls."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_atrium_01","Don't look up. Don't look up. You'll get dizzy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_atrium_02","Too many walls. Too many doors. Can't get out."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_b_response_b_01","My Beloved says there's danger ahead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_b_response_b_02","My dream turns dark ahead ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_collapse_01","No! No! What's happening?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_collapse_02","My dream is falling to pieces!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_corpse_01","Oh ... That looks like it hurt ... doesn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_corpse_02","That's revolting. Why did I dream it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_goo_01","That's horrible! My dream is rotting from within!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_goo_02","The slime. It's ... alive. It's aware of us ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_market_response_01","There should be people ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_market_response_02","Yes, Beloved. It's deserted."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_security_01","Where are the guards? Did they evacuate?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_security_02","I remember when the enforcers found me. Cruel eyes. Harsh words. All gone now."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_temple_01","This is horrible ... I don't like it here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_temple_02","Look what they've done to this place. It's ... impressive, I suppose."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_vista_01","No, Beloved, I don't think we've ended the plague."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_vista_02","This place is so ugly. My dream is so ugly!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_void_01","I miss the sun."
"loc_psyker_male_b__level_hab_block_void_02","I can't remember when I last saw the sun."

"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_03","Yes, Beloved, I have seen that grenade."
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_04","Oh, is that a grenade?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_05","I think I see a grenade!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_06","A grenade? Oh."
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_07","I think I've found a grenade!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_08","Does anyone want this grenade?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_09","A grenade? Why did I dream that into being?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_grenade_10","Someone's left a grenade in my dream ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_01","Healing! I knew we'd find some!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_02","A healer's station?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_03","We should bind our wounds. All of us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_04","A healer's station. How delightful!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_05","What a splendid healer's station!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_06","Oh. A healer's station."
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_07","We can heal? Yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_08","Yes, Beloved, it's a healing station. Shush."
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_09","A healer's station. Blessed be."
"loc_psyker_male_b__look_at_healthstation_10","Ooh. Balms and unguents."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_b_01","But I'm sure you're the most special, right, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","They call you the Alpha type. Stands to reason there should be others."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_c_01","It doesn't matter ... All Ogryns are lovely, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_four_c_02","My Beloved says you're all quibbling. Quibble. Quibble. Quibble."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_b_02","How can something so small be so dangerous?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_c_01","Ratlings are very good at hiding. There could be one here right now, and you'd never know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_one_c_02","Widely despised, yet always come up trumps. I think I like these ""Ratlings""."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_01","I think I feel most sorry for abhumans. Nobody likes them much."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_02","It's very unfair how abhumans are treated, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_03","I think it's sad how people look down on abhumans."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_a_04","Nobody likes abhumans much, do they? I never understood why."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_01","Everyone should be loved for who they are, no matter how monstrous or dangerous."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_02","There are some abhumans who no one ever talks about, and that's the saddest fate of all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","I think I'd like to see a Felinid, but they're very rare."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","My Beloved says Felinids are particularly beautiful. I'd like to see one very much."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_two_b_01","My Beloved says they do have souls. And so do lots of other creatures you don't like."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_abhumans_two_c_02","You'd be surprised how small and shrivelled some souls are. I take a peek on occasion."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_01","I hope you get your wish, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_b_02","Oh, sweet Brute, you do find pleasure in the simplest things."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","My Beloved admires your enthusiasm, but says you should concentrate on the matter at hand."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","I wonder if the heretics have tanks? I hope they don't have Null Shields. Makes them less... squishy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","But Roughneck, there are such horrors to come. You wouldn't wish that on your friends, would you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_02","You have new friends now, Roughneck. At least, I hope we're friends. I'd be most upset if not."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_01","Steel-eyed, cold-blooded killers. I like them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_c_02","I don't think we need the Imperial Guard just yet, but I suppose it's never too late to panic."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_01","I wonder why Imperial Guard Commissars are so... heartless."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_02","Have you ever met an Imperial Guard Commissar? They're so frightful!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_03","I've a lot in common with Imperial Guardsmen. I fear the Witch Hunters, and they fear the Commissars."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_a_04","My Beloved calls Imperial Guard Commissars a necessary evil. I wonder what he means."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_01","Oh, but they do have very nice uniforms."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_b_02","If they were nicer to their soldiers, I'm sure they'd get better results."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Commissars have a hard childhood. Perhaps they're just misunderstood."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","Behind their black garb, they're just lost children who need a cuddle."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","I've never met a kind preacher. Quite strange, when you think about it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","My Beloved thinks that if we really must kill in his name, then it's best we win."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Sebastian Thor was a simple preacher, and just look what he became."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_four_b_01","Yes, that does seem likely."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_four_b_02","All this categorisation of ""killers"". We're all fighting in the mud. Why quibble?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_four_c_01","I wonder if her crew get nicer uniforms?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_four_c_02","I think pirates have to sing. And I don't like singing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_one_b_01","She feels shackled by duty and circumstance. So do I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_one_b_02","She's trapped by honour and old debts. Funny. She doesn't look the sort for that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Oh, I'm sure she'll cheer up ... Once the killing starts."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_one_c_02","She looks lonely. Lonely and proud."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_a_01","No one's indispensable, of course, but I think the shipmistress is close. She doesn't seem to like it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_a_02","Have you seen how Rannick defers to the shipmistress? She must be important."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_a_03","No one questions Shipmistress Brahms, did you notice? Such easy authority."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_a_04","My Beloved says that the shipmistress is deep in Grendyl's counsel."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_b_01","I think she might explode soon. Like a bomb. That will be colourful, won't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_b_02","I don't think I could handle that sort of pressure."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_c_01","Perhaps my Beloved will cheer her up. He's good at that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_three_c_02","Well, we can't all be cheery, can we?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_two_b_01","Oh ... I don't think the shipmistress would care to hear that. Maybe I'll tell her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_two_b_02","That's probably not a wise thing to say ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_two_c_01","I don't think I'd like that life. Sounds like it'd be full of detail and boredom."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_brahms_two_c_02","You do know a Rogue Trader's life is more piracy than negotiation, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_four_b_01","When they draw near, the colours of my dream become those of rot and ruin. All is contaminated."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_four_b_02","All things decay. All things rot, or rust, or die. The heretics seek only to hasten the process."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_four_c_01","In my dreams I've seen entire systems fall to plague. And with it comes madness."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_four_c_02","Sometimes I dream of a realm of a Million-and-One Plagues, from where all corruption stems..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_one_b_01","My Beloved doesn't dispute their godhood, just their goals."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_one_b_02","Maybe they are gods, but I wouldn't recommend giving them your soul."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_one_c_01","In my dream, there is a changeling lord, who tells My Beloved the galaxy is his. And always has been..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_one_c_02","The lords of the Empyrean are cunning. I don't think the heretics know they're falling till it's too late."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_a_01","The Empyrean is dream. It is madness. It is a Realm of Chaos, from where our nightmares flow."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_a_02","Some don't believe the Realm of Chaos exists. But it does."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_a_03","All of our enemies hail from the Realm of Chaos. It is a place of nightmare, where souls are damned."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_a_04","Sometimes, in my dream, I see the Realm of Chaos. Were it not for My Beloved, I might just drift towards the maddening laughter and never return."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_b_01","I can only glimpse it in my dream. To look into the Realm of Chaos is to risk madness, and clearly I'm quite sane."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_b_02","No one but My Beloved can gaze into the Realm of Chaos. The rest of us would just go mad, and you wouldn't want that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_c_01","We've all dreamed of the Impossible Fortress, with its twisting spires of formless crystal. Haven't we? Haven't we!?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Sometimes I dream of an Impossible Fortress, floating on a sea of pink fire. A voice calls to me, and it sounds so like My Beloved I almost follow..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_two_b_01","My Beloved still reels from the greatest of betrayals, and fears it could happen again."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_two_b_02","Oh, they're quite real. You should definitely be worried."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_two_c_01","It was all Horus's fault. My Beloved should really have paid him more attention. We all make mistakes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_chaos_two_c_02","What happened to Horus is My Beloved's greatest regret. But back then, he was only human..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_four_b_01","It's a place of suffering... evil... It's where the monsters live."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_four_b_02","A great wound in the Materium, from which the powers of Chaos flow freely."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_four_c_01","My Beloved says it was made by a god. But that can't be right. He's the only god, isn't he?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_four_c_02","I see a realm of madness and despair… skies weeping blood… ancient stars burning…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Daemons are always just one bad dream away..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_one_b_02","They can't be that far away, or I wouldn't be able to hear them whispering."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_one_c_01","Sometimes they make incursions in great number. I have dreamt it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_one_c_02","I have dreamt of daemonic incursions so vast, whole worlds are swept away..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_three_a_01","If a Daemon ever got past my defences, things would be bad for you. Very bad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_three_a_03","Do you think I'm strong enough to resist a Daemon? Zola said so, but I'm not so sure."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_three_a_04","Sometimes, in my dream, I can hear Daemons scratching at my mind. I hope they don't get in."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_three_b_01","I couldn't be possessed, if that's what you mean. It's already rather crowded in here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_three_b_02","My Beloved says nothing can get into my head while he's in there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_three_c_01","It was either this or the Soul-Binding... I wouldn't have minded being bound to My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_three_c_02","You all look frightened now. I hope it's not something I said."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_two_b_01","It was the Blackening. The horror still haunts my nightmares."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_two_b_02","I dreamed a dream of madness and terror. The dream never really ended."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_two_c_01","I think they blame psykers for the whole thing. I do hope they don't execute me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_daemons_two_c_02","I sense troubled times ahead for my kind. They'll need someone to blame."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","My Beloved is far too humble to call himself a god."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","What's that, Beloved? Dangerous talk? Oh, don't worry, the Brute's far too big to threaten."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","If you could gaze into the Empyrean, you'd see My Beloved's light. It's very comforting."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","My Beloved doesn't mind if you don't believe. His light is there to guide us no matter what."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","I can put in a word with My Beloved if you like."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","It's true that My Beloved has no more faithful warriors than the Adepta Sororitas."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","They do have the best songs though. ""We Bless the Sinner as He Burns"" is very catchy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I've also heard them called ""uncompromising""."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_01","My Beloved says there are worlds who know nothing of his light. That's why we have the Missionarus Galaxia."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_02","Pity all the Imperial Missionaries are off exploring. Could have done with a few here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_03","I wonder how many worlds the Missionarus Galaxia have reclaimed for My Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_04","There are some worlds that don't even realise they're at war, until the Missionaries find them. How silly!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","I mean, all human worlds belong to My Beloved, even if they don't know it yet."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","That's right, Beloved. Finders keepers. Missionaries are just reclaiming lost property."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","It's surprising how many Missionaries don't make it back. Apparently not everyone likes them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","I'd make a good Missionary. But My Beloved says he needs me here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","My Beloved says the Cardinals should listen more and chant less."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved, the Cardinals do have lovely hats."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","My Beloved rather likes the New Ecclesiarch. He's much better than the last one."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","My Beloved cannot count the number of Ecclesiarchs he's seen come and go."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","They're not so very different from you, Brute. Special, that's all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","Imagine if the Ordo Hereticus had been around when My Beloved was born..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","They say we're unclean. The very nerve!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_01","I know we do good work, Beloved, but must our order be so... cruel?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_02","I dreamt of bringing peace to the dispossessed. But we bring only cruelty and suffering."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_03","If I didn't know this was just a dream, I would say the Inquisition's methods were unusually cruel."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_a_04","Are all ordos of the Inquisition so... enthusiastic in their work? Or is it just us?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","You have a point, Sibling. They call it ""investigating"", but it's remarkably... stabby."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","This is just a dream, and nobody can really get hurt in a dream. Not really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Pain is an illusion of the senses, despair an illusion of the mind. So I'm told."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I know no one is truly innocent. But aren't some more guilty than others?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Did the Fanatic join the wrong Ordo by mistake?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Don't worry, Fanatic, I would never harm you... by accident."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","When you stare into the Warp, the Warp stares back into you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","I'm used to people being scared of me. My Beloved thinks they aren't scared enough."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","It's a war, Brute. The biggest war imaginable. And My Beloved isn't sure we're going to win."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","I think it's a nightmare. At least, I hope it is. I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Are you sure? It all seems like such a long way away."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","No, Beloved. It doesn't seem like a good idea to me either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Cadia... the whole system at war. Billions dead. I... felt it. My Beloved felt it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","My Beloved tried everything. You have to believe him. He really tried..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","My Beloved was desperate. He says he might have made a mistake."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","It was foreseen. But that's the thing with prophecy. Nobody really believes it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_04","Since the Psychic Awakening I have more siblings than ever. Not all of them good."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","In my dream, I see others... Xenos... they all share our dream now. And our nightmare."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","We fear our own kind more than ever, but My Beloved says the Awakening has touched the Xenos, too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","Oh, I have ever such a bad feeling about all this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","No, Beloved. I don't think they really understand what's happening either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","The Nachmund Gauntlet is navigable, they say, but the dangers of that passage are great."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","My Beloved can barely see beyond the Great Rift, and what he does see fills him with dread."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","Time flows differently in the Dark Imperium. Who knows how long they've been fighting the nightmare?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Great danger comes from the Dark Imperium. I feel it scratching at the edge of my dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","I know! I never knew I could dream in such detail!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","It's splendid, isn't it? So many new friends!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","I don't want to get too attached to anyone. I think most of them are going to die."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","I don't really see people. Just corpses that aren't dead yet."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","It doesn't bother me. My Beloved knows everything, so I don't have to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","I enjoy a good mystery. It keeps me grounded."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","It'll all turn out for the best ... I hope."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","Oh, stop complaining. You're upsetting me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_01","My Beloved says that Grendyl is distracted by other matters."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_02","I don't think Grendyl is entirely focused on Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_03","Grendyl claims Atoma is important, so why isn't Grendyl here?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_a_04","Surely Grendyl should be on the Mourningstar with everyone else?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","The Inquisitor can't be everywhere ... I don't think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","My Beloved is omnipresent. Alas, the same isn't true for the rest of us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","Oh, it'll all work out, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","You shouldn't worry. I just haven't dreamed Grendyl in enough detail yet. I'll get around to it at some point."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","It doesn't matter if Grendyl believes in my Beloved, so long as my Beloved believes in Grendyl."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Are you looking for common ground? Someone's ambitious."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","As long as the Fanatic's happy, where's the harm?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","The Fanatic could use a friend ... but I'm not sure Grendyl's a good fit."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_four_b_01","I confess, I don't really listen when she speaks."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Her voice is so ... Grating. I prefer to ignore her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_four_c_01","I don't see that it matters. After all, I'm in control of all this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_four_c_02","My dream, my rules. You shall do as I say, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_one_b_01","Oh, she doesn't unsettle me. After all, I can always unmake her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_one_b_02","Oh, I think I'm still creepier ... This is a competition, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_one_c_01","My Beloved says he wears a mask whenever he talks to her. That's strange."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_one_c_02","Oh, she loves my Beloved so she's probably all right."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_a_01","The Tech-Priest's mind is cluttered, but highly organised."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_a_02","I don't like looking in the Tech-Priest's head. Her thoughts make my eyes bleed."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_a_03","The Tech-Priest has very metallic thoughts. They taste like blood."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_a_04","You all think in spirals and bright colours. The Tech-Priest is all hard edges an monochrome."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_b_01","I don't think you're supposed to do that ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_b_02","You didn't ... pry? You'll get us both in trouble."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_c_01","Oh, it'll all be forgotten when I wake up. It always is."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_three_c_02","Don't you dare drag me down with you!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_two_b_02","Age doesn't matter. It's the ability to kill with impunity that counts."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_two_c_01","Oh! Imagine the sights she's seen. How nice!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hadron_two_c_02","My Beloved says that Tech-Priests believe flesh to be weak. Isn't that odd?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","Are you sure, Sweet Brute? She does seem to go through rather a lot of them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","I don't know about that. I hear such horrible rumours ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","You're not meant for that life, Sweet Brute. Stay here with me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Oh, don't go. Whoever will I kill things with?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","That's the purser, isn't it? Go on ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Oh dear. I hope I don't have to be scared of her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","My Beloved refuses to talk about her. That's very odd, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","I hear people who enter her stateroom don't tend to come out, whether they're invited or otherwise."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_01","My Beloved says the purser's prices are very high ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_02","My, the purser's certainly bold with her prices, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_03","The purser's prices are very high ... given everything is almost certainly stolen."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_a_04","I wish the purser wouldn't charge so much ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","She is rather forceful, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","My Beloved says she doesn't negotiate. Ever."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Oh well. You can't take it with you!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","Don't worry about it. There's no pockets in a shroud."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Oh, don't be so serious. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","You're forever clucking like a broody fenhawk. Cluck. Cluck. Cluck."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","She always has an aura of death around her. It's very strange."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","Her eyes aren't quite right. It's like staring into oblivion."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","They are the Highborns. They think themselves safe in their tower, but they aren't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Highborns, Brute. I don't think they've even noticed the nightmare below."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","It must be nice being above the clouds. I hear they even have windows."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","If I'd been born in a spire, my dream would be different, and I may never have met My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","I sense there's much worse in the deep hive... I hope we don't have to go there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","I sense darkness ahead. There is more to fear in Hive Tertium than mere gangs..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Perhaps the gangers are just misunderstood."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Everyone needs a chance at redemption. But if they shoot at us, I will have to make their heads explode."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_01","Hive-cities make me nervous. So many souls... so many thoughts... so much pain..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_02","I tend to stay away from crowds. Bad things can happen when my senses are overwhelmed. Bringing me to a hive was a very bad idea..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_03","I really don't like hive-cities. So many people... I can't tell who's dreaming who."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_a_04","No, My Beloved, I'm sure they wouldn't live in a hive-city either, given the choice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Imagine never seeing the sky. Mind you, the pollution is so bad you can't even see it from outside."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","The lower down you go, the older it gets. There are places long forgotten. Dark places."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Sometimes I think I might be awaken, because my dream couldn't possibly be this... depressing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","Yes, beloved, I also think we'd be better off in the High Hive."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Must we really make a tour of some smelly old factories?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved. Apparently without Moebian steel, your tanks would be poorly protected."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","I expect when everyone's dead they'll just man the factories with servitors. Sad, really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","At least the servitors will still be here when everyone else is gone."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Yes, Beloved, I would toll the Bell of Lost Souls for our brave Brute, too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_four_b_02","My Beloved says many a charlatan has had the Bell of Lost Souls tolled for them, so why not us?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_four_c_01","The most extraordinary things turn up in the most unlikely places. That's how My Beloved found me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_four_c_02","I think I'd like to be remembered a hero. Will you make that happen, My Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Everyone thinks My Beloved lives there, but he doesn't. Not really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_one_b_02","My Beloved thinks we're all better off out here. Terra isn't what it was."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_one_c_01","My Beloved would love to show us around, but the others won't let him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_one_c_02","I'd hate to see My Beloved shackled to that Golden Throne. He's better off here, with me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_a_01","My Beloved has many regrets. He says the Imperial Tithe is a harsh necessity."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_a_02","Do you think Atoma will ever start paying the tithe again? I hope not. It seems unfair."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_a_03","I dreamed of a galaxy free of the Imperial Tithe. My Beloved enjoyed the dream very much."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_a_04","I dreamed last night of the Imperial Tithe. Of children torn from their home worlds. Pain..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_b_01","In My Beloved's defence, not all tithes are paid in souls."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_b_02","My Beloved would like it known that tithes guarantee protection for all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_c_01","I hear some worlds make a game of the tithe. Sounds like fun!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I think the meaning of the tithe has been lost in translation."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_two_b_01","My Beloved finds it all very tiring."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_two_b_02","My Beloved never intended to take things so far."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_two_c_01","So many souls destined for destruction. Sad, really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_imperium_two_c_02","This world isn't so bad, once you get used to the smell."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","No, Beloved, I wouldn't like to meet one. Not after last time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","My Beloved says the problem with Assassins is that they don't really listen to him any more."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","My Beloved thinks we should speak no more of this. You never know who's listening..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Even acknowledging the existence of the Officio Assassinorum is a crime deserving assassination. So they say."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","My Beloved says it wouldn't work. The thing we need to destroy is buried deep... Very deep."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","It won't work. Not here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Every time a world dies, things get a bit quieter in My Beloved's head."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","My Beloved says we should stick to Plan A for now."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_01","I used to fear enforcers. Now we're in the Inquisition, we're above Imperial Law."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_02","Being above Imperial Law is fun. I rather like being in the Inquisition."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_03","No, Beloved, I didn't realise the Inquisition were above Imperial Law. I should have joined sooner."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_a_04","My Beloved says many in the Inquisition forget the burden of being above the law."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","My Beloved always intended the law to be applied equitably, but alas!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","I used to dream of fleeing oppression. Now in the dream I am the oppressor. How curious."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","If I make myself useful, I can't be prosecuted. My Beloved promised."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","They say the Lex Imperialis contains the word of my Beloved, but it doesn't sound like him at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved, no one loves their work quite as much as the Fanatic..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","My Beloved doesn't really want you to kill for him. He thinks perhaps you just enjoy it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","So much death... In my dream, My Beloved weeps."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","I don't know, Brute, but My Beloved says it's so noisy he can hardly hear himself think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","Eldritch power, Brute. And dreams. And souls."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","What's that, Beloved? You didn't build it... You found it? Oh dear..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","What's that, Beloved? Oh... Very well, I won't say anything if you don't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","My Beloved says Macharius was very brave... But not quite as selfless as he made out."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","What's that, My Beloved? [gasp] Scandalous! Do tell more..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","He fancied himself incorruptible... My Beloved believes that was not the case."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_01","My Beloved thinks we could learn much from past ages, were we to open our minds."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_02","Yes, Beloved, they close their minds to the past, and cannot dream of a brighter future."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_03","All this has happened before, and will happen again if we don't learn from past eras."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_a_04","We could learn much from eras past, but choose to close our minds to enlightenment."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Yes, Beloved. For all their faith, I think they'd just let you suffer all over again."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","Weren't their two Imperiums once? But only one of My Beloved, thankfully."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Every era is an Age of Battle. In my dreams I see fires rage from star to star, for all time..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","No, Beloved, there is little comfort or hope to be found in this dark era..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","Oh, you speak of Goge Vandire. My Beloved remembers him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","But it was so long ago, Beloved. Can't you just live and let live? Oh... No, I suppose you can't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Remember Sebastian Thor? They named him Master of the Warp. That was My Beloved's doing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Sebastian Thor put a stop to Vandire's reign... With a little help from My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_four_b_01","It's good to have someone you can trust ... or so I'm told."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_four_b_02","Loyalty and trust are very important. They provide contrast to the day to day."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_four_c_01","That may be, but he's a terrible bore."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_four_c_02","Grey and withered inside ... he's probably crawling with spiders, too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_one_b_01","You can't mean Lord Darius Melk. He's much too sophisticated for the likes of you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_one_b_02","My very good friend Lord Darius Melk wouldn't be mean to you. After all, you're so far beneath his notice ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_one_c_01","That said, he is a bit stuffy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_one_c_02","Oh, stop playing games. You find him unbearable too!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_a_01","That Melk fellow has all kinds of things hidden in his brain ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_a_02","Melk has lots of secrets. I can ... feel ... them crawling beneath his words."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_a_03","Melk's hiding something, you know. Lots of somethings."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_a_04","I know Melk's hiding something, but I don't know what."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_b_01","No one makes it through life wholly blameless, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_b_02","I'm sure it's nothing terrible. Probably."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_c_01","Perhaps his superiority is a shield. It keeps him from realising he's no better than us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_three_c_02","What a curious fellow. Why ever did I dream him like that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_two_b_01","Perhaps you should speak more like me? Everyone wants to, deep down."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_two_b_02","Oh, I do hope he expressed his concerns in kindly fashion."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_two_c_01","Cheer up, Fanatic. The words don't matter so long as you can be understood."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_melk_two_c_02","I could teach you my secret language if you like. It has fifteen vowels."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_four_b_01","This has all the makings of a horrible story ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_four_b_02","I bet it tickles. Did the storyteller say if it tickled?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_four_c_01","People are always making things up about Morrow. It's not nice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_four_c_02","Yes, Morrow's brusque ... but you're not sunbeam either!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_one_b_01","That seems unlikely ... even to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_one_b_02","I don't believe you. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_one_c_01","The past is an illusion. Only the present matters."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_one_c_02","The past is a broken mirror. Peer at it too long and you'll go mad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_a_01","I do find it curious that Morrow has such a strange past, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_a_02","Morrow's past is all tangled. It's very confusing, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_a_03","I don't know that I really understand Morrow's past. Don't you find it strange?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_a_04","Morrow's past is a tangle of threads. The truth is complicated, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Renown is a meandering river."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_b_02","Truth and lies, truth and lies, round and round and round and round."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_c_01","I just wish the sergeant major would smile more. He'd be less scary."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_three_c_02","At least we can all agree that Morrow has a splendid moustache, yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_two_b_01","That was a long time ago, wasn't it? I don't really do numbers."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_two_b_02","I don't want to quibble, but wasn't that a long time ago?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_two_c_01","He doesn't look a day over one hundred and fifty to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Isn't he wearing well? He must live an honest life."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Yes, very impressive. I took special care over the design when I started dreaming."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Thank you. I'm very pleased with what I've dreamed here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","I just wish we were allowed on the prettier decks. I'm sure there must be some."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","If only we weren't confined to such utilitarian passageways ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_four_b_01","What's so strange about it? It's much nicer on the Mourningstar than it is on Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Perhaps he doesn't want to be bothered by your ceaseless questions, sweet Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_four_c_01","I wish I could stay on the ship."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_four_c_02","I'd like an office. And a desk ... Oh! And a name plate!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He's certainly very thorough. He knows much we don't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_one_b_02","We're an acquired taste. I'm sure he'll acquire us eventually."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Don't worry! He'll warm to us. I mean ... who wouldn't?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_one_c_02","My Beloved says he's forever watching his back. Never eats anything that has left his sight."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_a_01","People keep telling me that Rannick is held in considerable esteem. Don't see it myself."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_a_02","Have you noticed how everyone falls over themselves to keep Rannick happy?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_a_03","Rannick possesses authority beyond his rank, did you notice that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_a_04","My Beloved says Rannick is bound for great things. Or death. One of the two."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_b_01","My Beloved says that Rannick doesn't care about that. All he has is his work."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_b_02","I don't think he cares. He seldom thinks of himself, only Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_c_01","I suggest you don't upset him. I don't think you'd like what follows."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_three_c_02","He is a hollow man, filled with another's purpose. What happens if that purpose fails, I wonder?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Oh, my Beloved says he doesn't mind ... as long as Rannick does a good job."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_two_b_02","I'm sure your opinion means a lot to both Rannick and my Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_two_c_01","I could talk to him, if you'd like? After all, no one knows my Beloved better than me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_rannick_two_c_02","For some, faith is a closely guarded possession. Rannick's zeal goes deeper than you perceive."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_servitors_one_b_01","They never look happy, did you notice? They never look anything at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_servitors_one_b_02","They perceive a world we cannot see. I suppose some might call them blessed."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_servitors_one_c_01","Ah, but are we any less the cogs in the Imperium's great machine?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_servitors_one_c_02","We all serve my Beloved, don't we? Only some of us serve with pieces missing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Novitiates are little more than children when they are transformed. It's quite sad, really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","What's that, Beloved? A Biscopea? And did you have one of those?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","Oh, I don't know Beloved. I think I'd quite like a Catalepsean Node."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","My Beloved just told me how they get the Black Carapace in, and now I feel all... icky."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Yes, Beloved, they're talking about the Adeptus Astartes. No, no... the good ones."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","My Beloved says you should be careful what you wish for."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","It'd be nice to save Atoma, wouldn't it? I don't think the Space Marines would take much care."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","When I dream of Space Marines, I see death... So much death!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_01","When Guilliman returned, My Beloved was the happiest he's been in ages!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_02","The return of Roboute Guilliman has made My Beloved very happy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_03","Many don't believe Roboute Guilliman has really returned, but My Beloved assures me it's true."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_a_04","Yes, Beloved, I know you're happy about Guilliman's return. Others are sure to follow."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","My Beloved fears the wars will never end. Not now Guilliman is in charge."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","What's that, Beloved? Yes, I think we'd have all preferred Sanguinius."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Really, Beloved? It was xenos magic that did it? The Ecclesiarchy won't like that..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","No, Beloved, I don't think the enemy will let this go unanswered either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","My Beloved says the scale and pageantry of the Astartes remains unsurpassed."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Yes, Beloved, it does sound like Guilliman had ideas above his station."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Yes, Beloved, it's high time the Codex was amended."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Everyone prefers the Chapters that don't follow the rules."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","My Beloved is rather handsome in my dream. Or is it his dream? It's hard to tell."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","You wouldn't want to know. It's really quite sad for him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","My Beloved would like us to change the subject. He's terribly self-conscious about his body."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I would very much like to visit you at the Golden Throne."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","My Beloved speaks to me all the time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","He talks a lot actually. But most people can't hear him outside their dreams."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","My Beloved does try, but the High Lords of Terra don't always listen."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","Yes, Beloved, I think they're finally asking the right questions."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_a_02","Sometimes I share My Beloved's dream... of sacrifices, given unwillingly to the Golden Throne..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_a_03","Do you not hear the screams of those sacrificed to the Golden Throne? I do. So does My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_a_04","My Beloved is restless. They must be making the sacrifice of souls again... Will it never end?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Only through sacrifice can My Beloved maintain the Astronomican. Without it, we are lost."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","Without sacrifice, there would be no Astronomican. Without the Astronomican, My Beloved would not speak to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","The thoughts of my siblings light the Darkness that others may cross space."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","I suppose they don't die. Not really. They're here in my dream, with My Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","Believe me, My Beloved would rather it had worked out differently."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","My Beloved had other plans for the Golden Throne, but fate is a cruel mistress."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","If My Beloved fails, every one of you will become a gateway for the ravening hordes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","My Beloved inhabits a realm of nightmares, so you don't have to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Oh, sweet Brute, bless you for trying to think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Some will tell you it is Warp Drives, or the Astronomican, or Navigators. Really, it's just magic."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Think of it like diving into cool, clear water. Only the water is full of monsters that want to kill you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","My Beloved insists it's only dangerous if you think about it. Why not spare yourselves?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","Every voyage into the nothing is a confrontation with horror."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","You fear the unknown. My Beloved says you don't know the half of it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","To gaze into the Warp is to stare into the abyss. And sometimes it stares back."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","My Beloved watches out for me in the Warp. He'll probably watch out for you, too. If you're nice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_01","Time flows strangely within the Empyrean, like unto a dream. Perhaps it is a dream..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_02","Do you feel how time flows strangely within the Empyrean? Do I dream it the same for all of you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_03","I always feel giddy after Warp travel, and time becomes all... wriggly."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_a_04","My dreams flourish in the Empyrean, but my physical form is at the mercy of time displacement."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","It would be rather nice to just dream forever, until we can dream no more..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Travel from one end of the Imperium to the other might take a few years, or a lifetime, but we'd barely notice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","There are time bubbles in the Empyrean. Must be quite peaceful in there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","All this talk of time makes me sad for My Beloved. The ravages of time are not kind to him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","Oh, you don't want to think too much about Warp entities. It only makes them stronger."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Shh! Don't talk about the Warp entities. If they hear you, they'll get very cross."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Warp predators whisper to me all the time. You get used to it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","My Beloved says only those with special gifts have anything to fear. So... you're mostly safe."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Oh, that is good to hear!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Well that makes sense. After all, I like you both."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","Friendship springs from difference ... or so I'm told."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","I think I'd like more friends. Or a friend."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","I am missing something? I'm not sure what the problem is."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","I could try to be more unsettling, if you think that would help."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Sefoni isn't responsible for how you perceive her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_01","I do like Sefoni. A sparkling soul!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_02","Sefoni is nice, don't you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_03","Sefoni really is wonderful!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_a_04","My Beloved adores Sefoni."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","Oh, I like talking to her. Or I like hearing her speak. I can't get a word in."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","She's very unusual, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Well, I don't know that she likes you very much."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","She much prefers me to you. Sorry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","I enjoy our little chats. She reminds me of my mother."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","She's very strict, but I like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Don't worry ... It's all a dream anyhow. My dream. Not yours."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","I don't think complaining changes anything. My Beloved doesn't like it when people complain."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_01","The valkyries aren't exactly comfortable, are they?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_02","I wish I'd dreamed up comfier transport craft. With grav-dampeners."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_03","I do hope there's less turbulence the next time we deploy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_a_04","I wish we could take a more civilised form of transport to our missions."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","All that bucking and weaving. It all makes me feel rather ill."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","I get dizzy. And when I get dizzy I ... Well, never mind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","I don't think they understand, Beloved. Not one bit."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","Never mind. It's not like we're going to do it over and over and over and-- Oh."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_war_end_b_01","Oh, I do hope so. I'd like to wake up."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_war_end_b_02","It depends how long my dream lasts, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_war_end_c_01","I don't suppose I mind, but it's all very tiring."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_war_end_c_02","None of you are any help. I shall ask my Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_four_b_01","I think you're right, Brute. [Whisper] But you're not supposed to tell."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Be careful, Brute, too much knowledge is a dangerous thing. I should know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_four_c_01","They have no presence in the Empyrean, so even psykers can't find them. It's very clever."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_four_c_02","If it looks human, and thinks like a human, is it not human? Something to ponder."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_one_b_01","If you stopped to talk to them, you'd probably find most xenos aren't so very different from us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Oh, I think daemons are far worse. It's not xenos who scratch away inside my head every night."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_one_c_01","My Beloved warns of a race of metallic warriors; least understood, and most likely to endure."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_one_c_02","They were here long before us, and will be here long after we've gone. It is foreseen."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_three_a_01","Why does everyone get so cross about using xenos technology? My Beloved did it all the time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_three_a_03","Why must humanity always stand alone? Surely if we shared knowledge with the xenos we'd be stronger."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_three_a_04","I wonder why we always destroy xenos technology instead of using it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_three_b_01","Those of our order use Daemon-weapons, don't they? Isn't that the same?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_three_c_01","My Beloved says it's a pity we didn't try to understand the Cadian pylons before they fell."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_three_c_02","The Great Rift could have been prevented if only we'd studied those strange pylons on Cadia..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_two_b_01","My Beloved says we owe the Aeldari more than we can yet know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_two_b_02","A darkness follows the Aeldari, a shadow they cannot escape, for it comes from within."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_two_c_01","The Aeldari cling to existence against an enemy they cannot overcome. It's really very sad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_xenos_two_c_02","Theirs is a sad tale - an entire race who've seen their own doom and cannot escape it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_four_b_01","Yes ... An adamantium mind, locked down tight."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_four_b_02","I don't know. She scowls quite a lot."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_four_c_01","Would you like me to dream her as something more ... tractable?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_four_c_02","My Beloved says we shouldn't upset her ... so I'm not going to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_one_b_01","Her thoughts are always in motion, like bodies floating down a river."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_one_b_02","She seems conflicted. I don't know why. I didn't dream her that way."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_one_c_01","I think I'd like to be her friend ... Or dissect her. One of those."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_one_c_02","I could put her back together differently, if you'd like. Would you like that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_a_01","Explicator-Lady is a fascinating one, isn't she? So determined."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_a_02","I do like the Explicator-Lady. She has just the right amount of arrogance ... and fear."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_a_03","Zola seems almost ... afraid for us. Or is that afraid ""of"" us?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_a_04","My Beloved says that Zola isn't as confident as she seems."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_b_01","My Beloved says she's often confused."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_b_02","She's all twisted inside, isn't she?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_c_01","The last time she spoke, she was wondering if she'd have to kill you. Isn't that fun?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_three_c_02","It must be hard, working for Rannick. Authority without autonomy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_two_b_01","It's easy to have faith when my Beloved talks to me as much as he does."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_two_b_02","I don't need to believe. I know. I can see my Beloved. All the time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_two_c_01","My Beloved appreciates Zola's service, don't you Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__lore_zola_two_c_02","Actually ... My Beloved would much rather you all strive for happiness, instead of bowing and scraping all the time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Oh. This is rather heavy, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Why did I dream myself as a beast of burden?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_alarm_01","I don't like that noise! Make it stop!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_alarm_02","Speak up Beloved! It's very noisy in here!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","My Beloved says we're not getting in that way."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","Locked. Locked, locked, locked, locked, locked ... Locked."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","My Beloved says there's very little truth in this place."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","I don't think I'd want to catalogue all this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","All this talk of hidden traitors ... It's very worrying."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Treachery is so very subjective isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","It's such a big place, this archivum. I keep thinking we'll get lost."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","My Beloved says he's very impressed with all this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","My Beloved says this is a horrible place. So do I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","What fascinating smells. They're going to linger with me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Is the train damaged? Can it not move under its own power?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","No, Beloved. I don't see why we can't simply drive the train off, either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","That seems very clear. For a change."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","All right all right all right. You've made your point."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Tech Priest? My Beloved wants me to ask you about your past."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","How did you come to serve Grendyl, Tech Priest?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","That's very interesting. Thank you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","There's no need to mock me. I was only asking."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","My Beloved wants to know if our support team are real. I mean, really real."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","I thought we were getting a support team for this?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","I suppose we'll see what happens. And have words after, if need be."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Well, that seems very satisfactory. I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Round and round they go. Round and round."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","All that back and forth with no idea where they're going. Like us, really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Twist and turn. Turn and twist. Is anyone else dizzy?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","It's a very complicated building, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Yes, Beloved. There are unquiet spirits everywhere."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_something_big_02","Oh dear ... I hear screams. Are they real? Were they real?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Why are these soldiers hanging back? What do they know that I don't?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","So many soldiers! ... Filthy, aren't they?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","In the quiet moments, I can hear the cartel's victims. The starving. The parched. The mutilated."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","The air is thick with screams, even now. The Water Cartel's victims cry out for justice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","They are gone. My Beloved assures me that this is so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Fate is cruel, but sometimes justice is kind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","My Beloved says the Water Cartel rotted from within."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The Water Cartel were so very foolish, letting the heretics corrupt them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","It's very tangled, isn't it? Loyalties in conflict ... the soul in the balance."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Oh dear. It's all very distressing."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Do you dream of your latter days, explicator? Does it haunt you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","My Beloved says that you have done many things you regret explicator. Is that so?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","I don't think I like you very much. I might dream someone else to take your place."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Your secrets haunt you, don't they? I … feel them floating at the top of your mind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Oh! Look at that sigil. A primitive way of marking territory. I'd have used corpses."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_insignia_02","Oh look. The cartel has marked its territory. Like dogs. Or children."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","My Beloved names this a travesty. No one should live thus."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","They live on that which goes to waste in the levels above. How dreadful."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","Tertium's bones are rotting. The heretics are merely maggots come to the feast."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","My Beloved would weep to see his realm thus."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Oh look! The bazaar has become a place of games. Where prizes are doled out in blood."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","So much death! And all of it deserved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_shanty_01","This squalor is not my Beloved's doing. It springs from the corruption of lesser men."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_shanty_02","If they could, the Administratum would have us all in the mire. Toiling. Toiling. Dying."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_water_course_01","The river's a very pretty colour."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cartel_water_course_02","Tertium is a living thing really. We are merely microbes, treading its poison blood."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Beloved? Please make the elevator go faster."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","The elevator's coming! So are the heretics! Oh ... "
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","What's really going on here, pilot-lady?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","My Beloved says you're not being honest about our mission, pilot-lady."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","What a complicated dream I've created."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Treason is seldom absolute ... Don't look at me like that. My Beloved told me to say it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","No, Beloved, I don't know where the message is going."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","I'd like to know who's receiving the transmission ... I mean, assuming we manage to send it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","My Beloved says that's not quite right, but he won't tell me why."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","So many lies. So little truth. No wonder I'm dizzy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","My Beloved won't tell me what's in the message. He's no fun sometimes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","Encrypted details. Special missions. This message must be very important."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Sounds very dry. It could use a good story to spice things up!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","War is a dry, desiccated business ... until you're knee deep in blood."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","My Beloved says we're not being told everything ... Even more so than usual."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","I have had a vision of great carnage in the near future ... Just for a change."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_way_in_01","My Beloved says this will work!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_complex_way_in_02","Behold! I have dream and entrance just for us. Aren't I nice? ... Say it ... Say it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","So much damage. I don't know if it can ever be fully repaired."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Those heretics have caused so much destruction! How dare they!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","It was a perfectly appropriate question. You could at least answer it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Are you feeling well? You're talking very strangely."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Many died when this factory was seized. Will no one weep for them?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Thousands perished in this factory's fall. They should be remembered."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That's horrible. You do see how that's horrible, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","This is a heartless world I've dreamed. Perhaps I should unmake it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I don't remember dreaming this factory as important, but I suppose it must be."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","I imagine I dreamed many factories of this kind. Surely losing just one won't matter?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Oh … Then I suppose we'd better not fail."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","This is a brutal dream I've created. Maybe I should try to wake up."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_heat_01","The air's so hot ... it feels like it's squeezing me tight."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_heat_02","Isn't it hot? I do like to be warm. But this is a little too much."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_leaving_01","We're going? And I'd just got used to the warmth."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_leaving_02","I've a feeling we'll return. I have dreamt it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","This must be very pretty when it's working properly … Dangerous things always are."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","It's all so very complex. I'm not sure how I dreamed it into being."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","I must say, Beloved, I find this whole place fascinating. And horrible."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","So many levers and switches. Should I pull one?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_production_line_01","I wonder if I could dream a whole tank to life? Wouldn't that be useful?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_production_line_02","My Beloved says that the original Leman Russ drank too much. That feels unkind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Restless nights and hollow dreams. Souls wear thin in this place."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","Yes, Beloved. They sleep here because they've nowhere else to go."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_deception_01","I don't like cogitators. All that clicking and whirring. They're plotting against us, you know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_deception_02","So this is a game, is it? We're hiding something, and hoping the heretics don't find it, yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","I think someone's redecorated."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","There is a point when law ends and self-interest asserts itself, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","It's as if the enforcers were never here, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Echoes upon echoes, and the enforcers the faintest of all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","That doesn't sound very nice. Not at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Life is a wheel. It will turn, if we wait long enough."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","I can almost picture you in this place, explicator. Why is that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","You're troubled, explicator. Don't deny it. I'm just trying to help."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Well I suppose it could have been worse. Probably."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","We are not defined by our past, explicator. No. You're defined by my dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I don't know why anyone would choose to go into prison. Present company excepted."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Were I a fearsome warlord, I don't think I'd have a prison as my palace."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","It looks like a child's balancing puzzle. Not that I was ever allowed to play games."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Is that hab really safe? I mean, really, really safe? It doesn't look it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","I don't like it down here. Can we go now?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","It's filthy and smelly and horrible. Beloved, how did we come to this?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","What a revolting smell. Is that one of you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","That stench! I could do with that being a bit less real..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","Oh, shops! Alas, I've no credits."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","All closed. Like a zealot's mind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","I really don't think the floor should be slanting like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","I think the hab's off-kilter. Then again, everything is on Atoma, one way or another."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_alive_01","I think the smelter is breaking free!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_alive_02","Yes, Beloved! I think it's working!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","My Beloved wants to know why this place is so important."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","This place holds a secret, doesn't it? Or something close to a secret."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","I'm not sure I understand all that, but you sound very excited."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Yes, Beloved. This place makes better tanks. Isn't that fascinating?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Yes, Beloved. I'd like to know more about the Tech Priest. But she won't tell me, will she?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","The Tech Priest's very aloof. I wish I knew more about her."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","See? Isn't that better? I think we're going to get along famously."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","If you're not happy, just tell me. I can dream you differently."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Isn't it odd that we can get this place running again so easily?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Will it really be so simple to get this manufactorum working again?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","A very satisfactory explanation, if an unhappy one."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Oh, I get it! It's like children fighting over a toy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Beloved? Which way is the smelter?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Coo-ee! Smelter! Where are you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_hellhole_01","It's getting horrible in here ... Can we leave?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_hellhole_02","I want to leave. It's getting too ... hot."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_lifeless_01","This place must be very noisy when it's in operation."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_lifeless_02","The manufactorum's like a living thing, isn't it? Heretics are the disease, and we're the antibodies!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","Are we sure there's not a back way in?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","No, Beloved. I don't think running up to the front door's a good idea either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_propaganda_01","It all seems very ordered. And order is the enemy of freedom."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_propaganda_02","I don't know why I dreamed this place. It seems so very ... oppressive."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","I don't think that elevator's going to get here in time ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Beloved? Please make the elevator arrive faster!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","No, Beloved. It's ... not nice here ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","The air tastes like burning blood. Unusual."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","My Beloved says this manufactorum is special, somehow."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Yes, Beloved. There is a strange feeling to this place."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_hack_01","Servitors and machines like talking to me. They know that I can hear the echo of their dreams."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_hack_02","I wonder if the data-interrogator hurts, when it is used?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","While this place may look worse than the habs inside, I'm not sure it is."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","The shacks may not look pretty, but at least they offer freedom. Sort of."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Beloved, I think there's something appalling in here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","I don't think we're alone. There's something... horrible close by."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","I don't like the sound of that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","I knew that! I think. I mean, I probably should have done."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved wants to know why the daemon is here. So do I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Why is the daemon here. It seems a strange place to choose."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Well that doesn't sound very promising at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Evils always multiply when left to fester."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Is this daemon in other places too?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","My Beloved says the daemon gets everywhere. It has no manners, he says."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","I'm sure my Beloved will sort it all out."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","The evils that go unseen are often the most widespread."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Fascinating! The daemon must have fill the whole elevator shaft."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","No. No. I don't want to ride the lift any longer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A psychic pathogen? Why ever did I dream that up?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","I don't believe this broadcast is the real enemy. That's just what they've chosen to tell us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I think we're a very long way up."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Are we above the clouds? Please say yes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I don't like walking while I'm awake. It's no better while I'm dreaming."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Oh no. Another long walk ahead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Isn't the air dry? It's almost refreshing, in its way."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","I don't know about you, but I think more clearly in this thinner air. And I don't want to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Oh. This is nice. If only everyone wasn't trying to kill us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","That which feels better in sunshine always remains lurking in the shadows."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","Did I just hear the doors lock?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","Have those heretics just sealed us in? The scamps."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","I don't want to worry anyone, but I think they just sealed us in."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","Oh dear ... I think we've just been sealed in."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Mourningstar? ... Oh, typical. The vox isn't working."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Erm ... Is anyone else's vox working?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","Mourningstar? Hello! Hell-ooo?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar? I think we're trapped, what should we ... Oh, it's not working."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","Yes, Beloved. I think we're going to have to kill everyone."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","I don't want to die in here. What will people say about me?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","Are we really going to die in here?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","Oh good. We're trapped and alone. How fun."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_01","Exploding valkyries are very pretty, but perhaps not today. We should disable that skyfire relay."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_02","My Beloved says we should disable that skyfire relay so it doesn't rain body parts and broken valkyries."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_district_gate_01","That's a very big gate. But I could open it with my mind, if I wanted."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_district_gate_02","The gate is sealed. Everyone is trapped. It will be a slaughter."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Well, we're here. That's important, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","I forgot what function this place holds in my dream ... That's strange."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Imagine that! My dream is full of trains, whizzing about, back and forth. Oh, I'm dizzy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","It seems this place will be a killing ground many times over before the war is done."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved is very impressed with your knowledge, explicator. So am I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","How do you know so much about this part of my dream, explicator?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","My Beloved says he's proud of how far you've come."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","My Beloved says he's watching you very, very closely. That's nice, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I must say, special issue ammunition sounds terribly complicated."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","I'm not sure I want to use special issue ammunition. It sounds unsporting."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Oh. That's disappointing. Maybe I should dream some for myself too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","No, Beloved. That doesn't seem fair at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","This is all seems familiar ... Then again, it is my dream, so it should."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","Are we going inside the hab block? No? Oh."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","We see all the nice places ... Though I wouldn't say no to more light."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Is it dark in here, or do I have my eyes closed?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_trains_01","Tertium is like a living thing ... The railroads are its arteries, thick with infection."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_rails_trains_02","I like trains. They seem so ... certain of their purpose."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","So many twisty turny twisty turns. And stairs too. I'm bound to get lost."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","My Beloved says we should be careful not to get lost."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Are you sure it's moving, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","This bridge has no sense of urgency."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","It's not a very happy name, is it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","I'm not sure I like that name Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","It's a big bridge. I don't think jumping up and down will fix it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","No Beloved, I don't know how we're going to do that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","Yes Beloved, there are a lot of them!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","I want to kill all of them! Is that allowed?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Oh, I'm enjoying this. I think. Well, maybe not."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Are they still there? Never mind. I can hear them!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","The pulpit's empty. Alas, prayers have their limits in such times."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","No, Beloved. I don't think the preacher should have fled either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","I'm sure my Beloved has looked after him."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","Perhaps I should give a sermon. I can be very uplifting."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Oh, I like it here. Isn't it ... dignified?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Yes Beloved, this is the Imperium I thought I'd dreamed."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_retrieve_01","I'm not really one for carrying heavy things about … but I suppose I must."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_retrieve_02","Yes, Beloved. I think if we're carrying heavy things around, we should be allowed to open them first."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scan_01","I think that servo-skull keep watching me ... Someone tell it to stop!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scan_02","That servo-skull's spying on us! It is! My Beloved told me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","Bright! I feel my spirits lift … Although I'm sure dark deeds await."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Yes, Beloved. It feels good to be out of the depths. If only the view were a little nicer."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Glory to dust. It's sad, in its way. I wonder how long it's been like this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","We walk amid the ruins of splendour - a foreshadowing of our own fate. Has it been this way long?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","I suppose I can always dream it back to how it was. If I choose to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","There is a sadness to it all … but I find little to be joyful about in this dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","I do not approve of my dream being laced with plague. I don't know what I was thinking."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","These plagues are not the only aberrations in my dream, but I suppose one must start somewhere."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Their thoughts drone like flies, did you know that? Buzz. Buzz. Buzz."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","There is no place in my dream for their kind. They'll all have to die."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Can you hear? The echoes of busier times. Not happier, but busier."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Wealth changed hands here in ages past, body and soul too. Everything had a price."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","It is the nature of existence for rise to follow fall. It is for the victor to determine the nature of that rise."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","All this talk of old days is making me nostalgic for a different dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_interior_01","I don't want to sound alarmist, but I fear it's not safe in here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_interior_02","No, Beloved. It doesn't look stable in here at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","Chitter, chitter, chitter. Their minds are like the rattle of keys and the buzz of flies."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","A room full of battered toys. Can we be certain any still function?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","The cargo elevator looks like a giant tongue, gobbling us up into the complex."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","Are we any less machines than the cargo elevator? After all, we dance at another command, do we not?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","The souls of the slain linger in this place … They scream in agony."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","There is the shadow of something … horrible nearby. The worship of the damned."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_approach_01","Yes, the station is very pretty, Beloved."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_approach_02","I dreamed a very nice station, didn't I? You should probably thank me for that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Oh dear. My dream has gone all hectic."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","It's not really killing if it's in a dream. My Beloved told me so."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","My Beloved says the matter is as good as settled."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Would you like me to bring you back a piece? I find fingers are the best keepsakes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","My Beloved would like to know more about the target. So would I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Don't think I haven't noticed you've said nothing about the target. Because I have!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Well that's disappointing, but I'm sure we'll do just fine!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Oh well. You can't have everything, can you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","Can you not hear the screams? The suffering. It is a bitter brew."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","This is not a nice place. My Beloved says its magistratum keepers misunderstand his message."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Move a train here. Move a train there. Why not simply ... blow it up?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Yes, Beloved. It is horrible down here. I wish we'd come another way."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Yes ... I knew you'd say that. I did."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Well, that seems satisfactory, I'm sure. Dreams aren't supposed to make sense, after all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","It doesn't seem very sporting, all this. I suppose that's why I like it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Oh, I do hope I get to see our target's face when they arrive. Won't they be surprised?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","But there has to be some hope in my Dream, doesn't there? That seems fair."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Oh, I'm sure we won't regret it. I find I regret almost nothing, in any case."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","No, Beloved. I still don't see why we had to do this here, of all places."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","So first we redirect trains from a marketplace ... now I suppose we're off to buy food in a scrapyard, or something."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Well, that seems reasonable enough, doesn't it Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Very well ... I'm convinced. It all seems very clever. But then, doesn't everything until the screaming starts?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","Look at all these soldiers. I wonder how many of them are going to die?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","Yes Beloved, there are a lot of soldiers ... Grubby, aren't they?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_station_hall_01","I might be wrong, but I'm not sure it's supposed to look quite like this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_station_hall_02","No, Beloved. I didn't dream this place right at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Oh look! Pretty lights in the distance! It does look nice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_station_the_bridge_02","Can't you feel it? The dead congregate on this bridge. Suicides ... The murdered ... The lost ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","This place still hums with the after-echoes of laughter... oh, and screams."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","I don't think I'd want to live here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I can... feel.. the daemon, rushing through my brain."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","The daemon is watching us... It knows we're here..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","I don't think it can be that simple. I think you're lying."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","You're not being truthful."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved wishes to know why we permit the heretics to remain here?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","The heretics will only dig in deeper the longer they're left."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Yes, Beloved. I wasn't convinced either."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","I'm sure he knows best. You will tell him I said so?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","There never really was any law down here, was there? Just bullies."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Enforcers. Cartel. Heretics. The boot may change, but not the stomping."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","You don't sound happy. Then again, you often don't."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","I can still hear the screams. This place is built on death."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","Yes, Beloved. That is a nice statue."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","Will anyone remember us when we're dead? I don't think we'll get statues."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","Oh dear. There's too much rubble for us to get through."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","No, Beloved. I don't think they meant to block the entrance."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","There's a funny smell, did you notice? Tangy, bitter and sour."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Poor hab block. We are all of us worn away in time."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","There's a peculiar tang to the air down here, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","It all looks like a giant tree, I think. We're among the roots."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","Does anyone else hear the wind howling? Or maybe it's the wail of damned souls. Easy mistake to make."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","I don't like it up here. It's ... uncivilised."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_crossroads_01","It's a maze! I don't like mazes."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Well, isn't this a pretty tangle. Tangle tangle tangle."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Beloved! Please! Get the daemon out of my head!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","Out of my head, daemon! I won't let you control me! I won't!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","All empty. All lifeless. It's sad, really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","I don't think these are the ones we want."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Oh ... That doesn't sound at all promising, does it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","I don't think we can permit that. I sense spilled blood and ichor in the near future."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","My Beloved says he can hear the elevator creaking."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Can you hear the echo in the shaft? It's a long way down."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Oh, I'm sure we won't fall. Well ... almost sure."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Don't worry! I'm sure my Beloved won't let us plunge to our deaths."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","But there are already so many lost souls here ... The damned ... The betrayed ... The lonely."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","Oh, I don't think I could be a part of that. It'd be very noisy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","I don't think I like the idea of a daemon waiting for us. Maybe it's part of a different dream?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Is there really a daemon in the refinery? I do get confused."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","Oh. Well. That's all right then. I'm very happy now."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Stop lying to me. I don't like it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Will we know if we're infected, do you think?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","My Beloved says we're at a substantial risk of infection. That seems bad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","I feel happier worrying, thank you. That way I'm in control."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","My Beloved says the soul rots first, then the body. I don't like the sound of that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","My Beloved wants to know what's special about this pathogen. So do I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","I'm sure I must have dreamed this pathogen into being, but I know nothing about it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Oh ... I'm not really sure I'm any the wiser."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","My Beloved says he'll keep me safe. You too, if you're nice to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","What a horrible, desolate place. [Cough] I think I just swallowed a bug."
"loc_psyker_male_b__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","Yes, Beloved. Someone has made a poor job of maintaining this place."
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_01","Oh dear!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_02","Look out!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_03","Look out!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_04","Oh no!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_05","It's angry!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_06","You're too close!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_07","Don't stand there!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_08","Get clear!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_09","Move!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_combo_attack_10","It's attacking!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","Yes, Beloved. This will test us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Oh, this looks difficult."
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","I'm not afraid. I'm not!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","We'll have to work together!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Are we to work together?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","Oh, this looks like a challenge!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","Let's kill it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","We should kill it!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","Ooh.. This should be most agreeable!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","It's horrible."
"loc_psyker_male_b__need_rescue_01","Won't someone help me? I need help! Heelllp!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__need_rescue_02","Oh Beloved, don't let them leave me here ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__need_rescue_03","My Beloved says you're to help me! At once!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__need_rescue_04","Help me up! Please! I don't like it here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__need_rescue_05","Oh no. I've been captured. Again. How did that happen?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","There's always plenty of daemon to go around, have you noticed that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","Too much daemon, not enough reality, don't you find?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","Squelch. Squelch squelch squelch. My boots will never be the same again."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","Ignorance does not become you, explicator."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","We are all drowning in horror. It might be better to yield to the current."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","My Beloved never smiles when he talks about Atoma lately."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","Take a deep breath, explicator. It's all going to be fine."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","You sound angry. I don't think that helps very much."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","My Beloved says that the heretics worship disease. They're very odd."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","Worshipping sickness of the body suggests sickness of the mind, doesn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","My Beloved says it's more complicated than that, but won't say why. Odd."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","That's horrible. And stupid. They deserve to die."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","What's a 'Nurgle'? It keeps running through these heretics' brains."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","There's a word at the top of everyone's minds ... 'Nurgle'. And there's jolly laughter too."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Oh dear. Have I said something wrong?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","My Beloved says it's deeds that matter, not words."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","Yes, Beloved. There's slime everywhere. Daemonic slime, I'm told."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","Tertium is rotten through. What we see now is just corruption oozing to the surface."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","My Beloved agrees, though there's a funny note in his voice ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","But plague always returns, doesn't it? Always, always, always."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_01","I can hear something ... Like a low, heavy heartbeat. But only in my thoughts."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_02","Beloved ... ? What is that creature?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_03","I can hear its thoughts ... They're cheery and vile ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_04","Oh! ... A creature in the wall. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_05","I don't think I want that as a pet. No thank you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_06","[Disgusted Noise] I don't like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_07","That is a truly vile creature. Can't you feel its malice?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_08","Don't be afraid of that creature. It just wants to smother us with pestilence."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_09","Stay away from me, vile thing! ... Oh, it's stuck to the wall. Good."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_alive_10","The physical world rebels ... That creature is only a harbinger to what is coming."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_01","Beloved? I don't want to dream this anymore!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_02","It's all so lumpy and ugly ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_03","No. I don't like any of this. It'll have to go."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_04","It's like some vast, hungry beast, scratching at the corners of our universe ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_05","The infestation can't be stopped, you know. Only delayed."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_06","I don't like these extrusions. Maybe if I close my eyes, they'll go away? ... Oh ... No ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_07","My Beloved says these growths are very old, and also very young. I don't understand."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_08","We must drive this infestation back or it'll swallow us all!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_09","These growths are horrid. I want them gone! Now!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_10","Why can't we ever go anywhere nice? It always gets worse. Always."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_01","I don't like that shrine ... I think it's alive ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_02","The shrine shrine is a living thing ... after a fashion ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_03","No Beloved, that shrine shouldn't be here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_04","Companions! I'd stay away from that shrine!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_05","I don't like that shrine ... I think it's looking at me ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_06","A shrine? No. It's something worse ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_07","[Growl] That shrine has no business being here ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_08","There's a daemon in that shrine ... It's crawling through my thoughts ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_09","No ... No ... I don't want to go near that shrine ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_prop_shrine_10","Oh look, it's daemon shrine. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_01","Oh no! I didn't volunteer for this. Then again, I didn't volunteer at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_02","Yes. It's always there. Waiting beneath the surface. Hungry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_03","Yes ... There's something out there ... A presence. I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_male_b__nurgle_circumstance_start_b_04","I feel something ... We are candles before its black flame."
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_01","Stop it! Stop shooting!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_02","They're shooting me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_03","Pinned down!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_04","They won't let me move!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_05","I can't move!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_06","Don't just stand there! Shoot them!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_07","So much fire! Help!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_08","Yes Beloved, I'm pinned!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_09","Yes Beloved, there's too much fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__pinned_by_enemies_10","I'm pinned! Help!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_ogryn_01","Poor Brute, alas."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_ogryn_02","The Brute is slain."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_ogryn_03","They killed our Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_ogryn_04","You killed the Brute! You monsters!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_ogryn_05","No! Brute! Beloved, bring him back!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_psyker_01","Sibling? No!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_psyker_02","Sibling? Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_psyker_03","You killed my Sibling, you ... you ... !"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_psyker_04","They've killed my Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_psyker_05","I will avenge you, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_veteran_01","Oh no! The Veteran's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_veteran_02","Roughneck? ROUGHNECK?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_veteran_03","The Roughneck is slain!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_veteran_04","Roughneck? Oh dear."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_veteran_05","Beloved, I commend the Roughneck to thee."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_zealot_01","Oh is the Zealot dead?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_zealot_02","They killed our Zealot!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_zealot_03","The Fanatic's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_zealot_04","Goodbye, Fanatic!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_zealot_05","Alas, poor Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_01","Did you mean to hit armour?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_02","Yes, Beloved, they keep hitting armour."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_03","Does it have no weak point?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_04","It's armoured there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_05","It's armoured there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_06","Stop hitting armour! If it pleases you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_07","Look for a weak bit."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_08","There must be a weak bit."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_09","I'm sure it's weak somewhere."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_tip_armor_hit_generic_10","Why do you keep hitting the armour?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__power_circumstance_start_b_01","No, Beloved. I can't see in the dark."
"loc_psyker_male_b__power_circumstance_start_b_02","Yes, Beloved. It's probably going to be very scary."
"loc_psyker_male_b__power_circumstance_start_b_03","I might let one of you go first, if that's all right?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__power_circumstance_start_b_04","Don't mind me ... I'll be at the back, jumping at every tiny noise."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_combat_01","Oh… That was easy."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_combat_02","I've got… slime on me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_combat_03","You made me do that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_combat_04","I'm still alive?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_combat_05","My dream is very messy tonight."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_end_event_conversation_b_01","Die? It's a dream. I'm going to wake up."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_firefight_conversation_b_01","See Beloved? She isn't that bad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_01","Oh, I don't like it down here Beloved… Beloved? Why won't you speak to me?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_02","Horrible… What is that?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_03","No… Leave me alone!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_04","Beloved? Where are you? Where do I go? I don't like this dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_05","At last, Beloved… I hear your voice in the sirens. No, I shan't give up. I promise."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_06","Yes, I will kill them… That's a very good idea."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_07","I should help her, Beloved? Are you sure? She wasn't very nice to me…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_08","Get out of my way!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_09","The elevator's still working, Beloved? Oh, how nice… I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__prologue_monologue_10","Beloved… I am still dreaming, aren't I?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_a_01","No, Beloved. I don't think it's right that the others can't hear you like I do. Maybe they aren't real."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_beloved_c_01","No, Beloved. I don't think they're talking to me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_macro_a_01","I do hope one of you knows why we're here. Don't tell Morrow, but I'm not very good at remembering orders."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_purpose_b_01","I wasn't sure at first, but now I think I'm quite enjoying myself. Except for when I get shot."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_quibble_b_01","Oh, I don't know. I quite like them. They have a strange way of looking at the world."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_small_brain_a_01","I don't know how the others manage it, being so deaf and blind to the world."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_small_brain_d_01","Well, I am ... I'm not sure about the rest of you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_trusted_b_01","I'm not sure we are. We're just not as distrusted here as we were before."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_value_c_01","And me ... Only, if we don't, they'll probably kill us. Which wouldn't be very nice at all."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_weaponry_b_01","Careful, Sibling. It's not good to start talking like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_gang_metropolitan_worse_c_01","Yes. Almost cheerful. Oh ... you don't think they've got the plague?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_01","That Ogryn's impressive!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_02","Well done, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_03","Oh yes, Brute! Do it again!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_04","Such carnage! The Brute knows his work."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_ogryn_05","You are such an artist, sweet Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","Oh. Very well done, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_02","It's so pretty, Sibling! Such colours."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_03","We Psykers are good at killing!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_04","Where did you learn to do that, Sibling?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_psyker_05","Teach me to do that, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_01","A Veteran should be a killer!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_02","You do have talent for killing, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_03","The Roughneck's a beast."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_04","I'm glad you're on my side, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_veteran_05","You're souring my dream with blood, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_01","The Fanatic's out of control..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_02","Must you make such a mess, Zealot?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_03","You're getting blood all over my dream, Fanatic!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_04","No, Beloved, we can't stop the Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_zealot_05","Oh, the Zealot'S gone berserk."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_01","Oh… erm…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_02","Is this alright, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_03","Are you hurt, Brute? I'm sure it will mend."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_04","I'm sure it's nothing, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_05","Can you still fight, sweet one?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_06","Here Ogryn, let me help you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_07","Please… I only mean to help."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_08","Don't hurt me, Ogryn… I'm here to help…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_09","I'm helping, Ogryn. You… understand, yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_ogryn_10","It's… Yes… Friend? Friend."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_01","This doesn't mean I trust you, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_02","I'll help, Sibling. This time…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_03","Well, I couldn't leave you, Sibling, could I?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_04","I think you owe me now, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_05","I… Just don't betray me… Yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_06","Up, Sibling. They're watching us."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_07","Come on… Rise…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_08","Oh… You're not dead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_09","I thought you were dead, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_psyker_10","No, Beloved, I can't leave them."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_01","I have you, Roughneck…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_02","Stop squirming, Roughneck…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_03","It's not that bad, Roughneck…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_04","Stop making such a fuss, Veteran…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_05","I'm only trying to help, Veteran…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_06","I'll help you, Veteran…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_07","Come along, Veteran. We need you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_08","I'm here! Don't worry!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_09","Hush, Beloved. They're going to be fine…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_veteran_10","Yes I do know what I'm doing, Beloved…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_01","Need help, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_02","See, Fanatic? You do need me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_03","Plenty left to kill, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_04","You're not dead yet, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_05","You wouldn't want me to outlast you, Zealot…"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_06","It doesn't look that bad, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_07","You should probably get up, Zealot. If you'd like."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_08","I'll help!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_09","You need my help. Don't be difficult."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_zealot_10","I'm going to help you. Please don't get angry."
"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_01","Don't worry, it's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_02","Don't worry, it's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_03","It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_04","It's dead!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_05","Dead. Dead dead dead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_06","Dead. Dead dead dead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_07","I don't think it's there now."

"loc_psyker_male_b__quick_agnostic_enemy_kill_a_10","It's dead ... I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__ranged_gameplay_04_01","Oh yes. Dead is so very final."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_carnival_a_01","It all looks so jolly, doesn't it? But I'm sure it isn't really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_carnival_a_02","No, Beloved. I don't think it's going to be very nice here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_carnival_a_03","I can feel the riot of emotions from here. It's a very heady brew."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_habculum_01","So many people live down here. Makes it a good place to hide if you're on the run."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_habculum_02","I don't like the Sector Habculum. Too many enforcers, informants and witchseekers ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_habculum_03","Why did I have to dream up this maze?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_mechanicus_01","A grand edifice, but the wheels of industry grind us all to offal."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_mechanicus_02","So many unhappy souls worked to exhaustion … I hate it here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_mechanicus_03","Yes my Beloved. They do seem rather obsessive..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_periferus_01","My Beloved says he is blind in this place. I wonder why that is?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_periferus_02","I sense all manner of turbulent souls nearby. Did they make this place what it is, or vice versa?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__region_periferus_03","This place smells like fear... Beloved, why do I dream these things?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_01","Oh! No more ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_02","Why's the gun stopped working?!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_03","Why won't you shoot?!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_04","Oh, I see! My weapon's spent!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_05","Excuse me? I need more ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_06","Is there ammunition? I need some!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_07","I need ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_08","Oh! I'm out of ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_09","No, Beloved, I've no ammunition."
"loc_psyker_male_b__reload_failed_out_of_ammo_10","Oh no. My gun's empty."
"loc_psyker_male_b__reloading_01","Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reloading_02","Reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reloading_03","How do I reload? Ah."
"loc_psyker_male_b__reloading_04","I'm reloading!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__reloading_05","Oh. I should reload."
"loc_psyker_male_b__reloading_empty_01","Out?! Which bit goes where?!"

"loc_psyker_male_b__zone_transit_01","My dream is thick with horror … all of it centred here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__zone_transit_02","So much torment here, Beloved. Such pain."

"loc_psyker_male_b__zone_watertown_01","No My Beloved, I don't think anyone is enforcing the law here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__zone_watertown_02","It doesn't look safe, but I think this dream is a hiding place for many..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__zone_watertown_03","Yes My Beloved, I think people probably can do as they please here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__zone_watertown_acid_clouds_01","The air has a bit of colour. I like that. It's the vapours from Tertium's rotting corpse."

"loc_psyker_male_c__away_from_squad_06","Where are they? No sense of protocol."
"loc_psyker_male_c__away_from_squad_07","The solitude is not unwelcome, but I should find them."
"loc_psyker_male_c__away_from_squad_08","Not even an enforcer would linger here alone…"
"loc_psyker_male_c__away_from_squad_09","Can you hear me? You seem to have lost me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__away_from_squad_10","Am I abandoned, or are they lost?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_01","A necessary fate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_02","I take no pleasure in this."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_03","Deserved, but not relished."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_04","You have paid."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_brainburst_chain_a_05","The Lex speaks through me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_01","Not entirely displeasing."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_02","Proportionate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_03","You cannot hide from the Lex."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_04","Justice finds all."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_shards_chain_a_05","A deserved fate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_01","Let the Warp flow through you!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_02","Regrettable, but deserved!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_03","I smite thee!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_04","Behold my power!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__blitz_smite_chain_a_05","Your punishment is overdue!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_appetite_b_01","I have little appetite for such black and white appraisals. Everyone can find redemption."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_appetite_d_01","Regrettable, but your pragmatism is perhaps more appropriate than my empathy."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_bonded_a_01","I sense that you care little for any of us. This is not as it should be. We are bonded."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_bonded_c_01","This fine Imperium is beset on many fronts. Humanity's defenders are stretched thin."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_daemon_eyes_a_01","You need not fear me. I am no threat to one such as you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_daemon_eyes_c_01","That ... is not what I meant. But I suppose it is some rough comfort."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_dedication_a_01","I knew many like you during my time as an enforcer. Dedication and obsession are not the same thing."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_dedication_c_01","That is no way to live."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_even_handed_a_01","You are less … extravagant than your fellows. Well, less aggressive to your allies, at least."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_even_handed_c_01","Now you sound like the others."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_failings_a_01","You speak readily of our failings, Fanatic, but seldom of your own."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_failings_c_01","Then perhaps you would like to speak of them in private? Not all burdens need be borne alone."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_fate_a_01","Is Cadia's final fate known, save to the Emperor?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_fate_c_01","A harsh judgement to level, Associate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_fulfilment_b_01","I would suggest that prayer, fine art and better company are more fulfilling pursuits."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_fulfilment_d_01","You and I do not, perhaps, live in quite the same worlds."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_two_b_01","My thanks … But I’m not certain the military life would have suited me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_two_d_01","Nobody ever said life was fair."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_good_soldier_two_f_01","Agreed!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_psy_c_c_01","I'd welcome that. We must all strive to do better."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_in_control_b_01","Why, thank you. It has been the work of a lifetime to become so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_in_control_d_01","Be assured, I shall endeavour not to do so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_inconstant_a_01","I envy your certainty, Zealot. You know nothing of doubt."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_inconstant_c_01","I have always found my faith a comfort. Especially in hours such as this."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_innermost_a_01","You cloak yourself in fervour, Fanatic, but it cannot disguise the insecurity within."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_innermost_c_01","Have a care, my friend. What is hard so easily becomes brittle. And that which is brittle seldom survives."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_kindred_soul_b_01","It is true that even a “Freak” can serve, if trusted to do so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_kindred_soul_d_01","Contentment and fulfilment are one and the same to us both, I suspect."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_lex_two_b_01","Why so, Sibling?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_lex_two_d_01","I do not defend the Lex so much as use it to defend others."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_lex_two_f_01","Few do. And that is a great tragedy."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_mercy_kill_b_01","You would trust me with such a confidence? You clearly dislike me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_mercy_kill_d_01","I confess, the idea holds a certain … appeal. Proving you wrong, I mean. Not … the other part."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_battle_cry_b_01","I was not aware we had a battle cry."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_battle_cry_d_01","And do you think you'll know by the time we are ambushed? It happens a lot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_bored_b_01","For a creature of such simple desires, you spend an inordinate amount of your time thus."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_bored_d_01","Now the question is, shall I attempt to explain or will he simply--"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_bored_f_01","--interrupt me?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_calm_b_01","My serenity is but a mask. When I behold the woes wrought upon Atoma, it is all I can do to contain my wrath."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_calm_d_01","So it is said, but it is seldom said of Psykers. When we let go, terrible things come to pass."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_count_a_01","Are there many like you on your world, Brute?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_count_c_01","And how high can you count?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dark_clouds_a_01","We should be careful of Zola. I perceive a dark cloud gathering in her thoughts."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dark_clouds_c_01","That is not what I meant. She is troubled. Her mind dwells increasingly on the past. It could be dangerous for all of us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dark_clouds_e_01","Do so. And I will strive to maintain an open mind."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dreams_a_01","I once dreamed of living a life of adventure. How foolish we are in our youth."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dreams_c_01","That explains much. Dreams are a form of escape, but for you there is only the grinding horror of your waking life."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dreams_e_01","Until you break."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_example_a_01","If anything good is to come of this war, it must begin with us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_example_c_01","Indeed, but in the time before our inevitable demise, we can make our actions count. By our example, we can change the world."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_exploration_b_01","I am always thinking. Life is a puzzle that should be explored."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_exploration_d_01","I did not say that the exploration was always pleasant ... or soothing."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_b_01","The Emperor was watching over me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_d_01","Then perhaps you might spare an eye, from time to time?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fix_b_01","I despair to see this mighty city in ruins."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fix_d_01","We can indeed, but it will be a labour of many lifetimes."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_got_lost_a_01","You are a faithful companion, Brute. "
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_got_lost_c_01","Are you by any chance saying that because you're lost?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_harmony_b_01","Hush, Sibling. They do not perceive you as I do. In time, they will come to know you as I do, and see the shining soul within."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_harmony_d_01","Indeed it would. Harmony will serve our goals better than bickering."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hot_brain_b_01","You are perfectly adequate as you are, Ogryn. Do not concern yourself with this."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hot_brain_d_01","You have mine already, Brute. Others will recognise your worth in time."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hungry_again_b_01","But you are always hungry."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hungry_again_d_01","You weren't. We'll see what can be done once we return to the Mourningstar."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_implant_a_01","Do you mind if I make an observation?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_implant_c_01","I fear ... I do not believe your bone 'ead implant is working correctly."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_imposing_b_01","Then ignore them. Permitting others to impose their reality upon you seldom ends well. "
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_imposing_d_01","That is ... not what I was suggesting. Perhaps leave it for a last resort."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_kindness_a_01","You are a gentler soul than you seem, large associate, and I for one am glad that this is so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_kindness_c_01","Ah, but one can be both at different times. Even if that were not so, in this heartless galaxy of ours kindness is perhaps the greatest strength."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_let_down_a_01","I am getting the sense that you don't trust anyone."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_let_down_c_01","A cruel and unkind fate. But it need not be forever. I will always be here. You may rely on that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_locked_b_01","Look around. Wouldn't you lock your door as well?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_locked_d_01","I fear that is true here also."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lucky_rock_a_01","Why are you so downhearted, large associate?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lucky_rock_c_01","I am certain you will find another."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lucky_rock_e_01","Then it sounds as though your lucky rock might actually have been a skull. And there are more of those than we could possibly desire."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindless_a_01","It is always a pleasure to watch you work. You have what I can only describe as a talent for mindless violence."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindless_c_01","I'm not entirely sure how that is possible."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindless_e_01","That, I fear, is almost certainly true."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_morrow_b_01","Those things are all valuable, of course, but there should be more to the man than that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_morrow_d_01","Let us hope he is pleased."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_never_over_b_01","I concur, associate. This is far from over."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_never_over_d_01","Depressing, but accurate. Still, this is the life we lead."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_nobles_b_01","[Sigh] How much simpler this would be if we could just work together."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_nobles_d_01","While it would be impolite to agree, I fear I share your sentiment."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_peace_a_01","We walk among a ruined marvel. What heights might humanity achieve if we were able to focus on peaceful pursuits?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_peace_c_01","Yes, but there is no harm imagining what a world without war might resemble."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reading_the_past_b_01","Pieces of the past, Sibling. All great cities share their stories in the shape of their buildings. By learning to read that language, we learn the city's history."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reading_the_past_d_01","I can certainly try."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sky_a_01","I confess, I am impressed by your singlemindedness. You have a thick skull, but once something worms its way inside ... "
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sky_c_01","The sky?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sky_e_01","Because ... Because the Emperor wills it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smile_a_01","Did you just smile?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smile_c_01","I'm sure I saw you smile."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_smile_e_01","I did not imagine this."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soft_a_01","Do I sense a certain softening of your attitude?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soft_c_01","You are certain?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soft_e_01","Thank you for your time."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soldier_b_01","Is that a compliment I hear? I am honoured."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_soldier_d_01","Two compliments. Now this feels like a trap ..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_strong_b_01","You speak as if you chose to be here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_strong_d_01","I will certainly bear that in mind."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_symbiosis_a_01","I know some find you discomfitting, Sibling, but you have opened my eyes to the world in ways I had not believed possible."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_symbiosis_c_01","And just as you see yourself reflected in the world, I see the world reflected in you. It is a potent symbiosis."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_twin_a_01","Whenever I look at you, Sibling, I behold two of you standing side by side. I wonder what it means?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_twin_c_01","That is certainly one possibility. The others ... are more complex."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_twin_e_01","It is my blessing, Sibling. There is little more terrible than a mind that believes it has nothing more to learn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vision_ruins_a_01","I had a vision of this place last night. No longer in ruins, no longer corrupted by the heretics. It was glorious."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vision_ruins_c_01","I ... think I prefer my vision to yours."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vision_ruins_e_01","This is most troubling. Most troubling indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_a_01","If you feel yourself losing control, Sibling, try to relax. Center yourself on the moment. "
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_c_01","Those that are yours, embrace. Those that make terrible promises ... ? Those you must reject."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_e_01","Pray for a swift death."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_watch_back_a_01","I can rely on you to watch my back, can't I?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_watch_back_c_01","I will attend to that myself, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_weep_b_01","Many things, though not all of them salubrious."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_weep_d_01","The streets of this hive resound with betrayal, treachery and ill-treatment. If these walls could weep, they surely would."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_nature_b_01","I have always done so. What other life can offer such purpose?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_nature_d_01","High praise indeed. I think you are mellowing."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_never_trust_b_01","I sometimes wonder if you trust anyone at all."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_never_trust_d_01","We might surprise you yet. Do not let go of hope."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_new_weapon_b_01","I didn't think you'd had that one long."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_new_weapon_d_01","I find the intellectual cut and thrust of our conversations most stimulating."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_opinionated_a_01","You are block-headed, loud and opinionated, Fanatic. And yet I find you a balm for my own troubled soul."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_opinionated_c_01","And to slaughter his enemies, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_relaxation_a_01","You should try to relax. Precision suffers when the machine is wound too tightly."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_relaxation_c_01","They, Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_reward_one_day_b_01","I prefer to live in the here and now. Tomorrow may not come for so many of us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_reward_one_day_d_01","This conversation has become somewhat … disheartening."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_flamboyant_a_01","You are certainly more ... flamboyant in thought and deed than most of our kind, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_flamboyant_c_01","Perhaps a little of both."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_read_a_01","You are always looking out for your associates, Brute. I find that very inspiring."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_read_c_01","And what can we do for you in return?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_read_e_01","I'm sure we can at least try to teach you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_stillness_a_01","You should seek stillness, Sibling. Your thoughts are always so ... agitated."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_stillness_c_01","Of course, but calm serves better than fury in such situations. Or so I've always found."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_watcher_b_01","Why would I deny it? It is in my nature - and my training - to watch others."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_watcher_d_01","We are all threats, Sibling. It's simply that some are more urgent than others."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_trust_weapons_b_01","Ah, but I have watched you closely. You curse the former and deride the latter."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_trust_weapons_d_01","I suppose … that is one way of looking at things."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_waste_not_b_01","A not unfamiliar sentiment. But no one chooses to live a wasted life."
"loc_psyker_male_c__bonding_conversation_waste_not_d_01","I suspect they are born of many complicated ethical, economic and hubristic factors. Not that it matters. Damned is damned."
"loc_psyker_male_c__calling_for_help_01","I need assistance!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__calling_for_help_02","Help!"

"loc_psyker_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_02","Indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_03","Agreed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_04","Agreed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_05","I concur."
"loc_psyker_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_06","I concur."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_gas_b_01","It is most disagreeable, but our lot is not ours to command."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_gas_b_02","I have little fondness for it myself. It will linger long in my memory."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_01","We're here to fight, not scavenge, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_02","Calm yourself, Brute. There'll be provisions enough once we're done."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_01","Calm yourself, associate. Remain vigilant, and we will prevail."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_gas_b_02","Vigilance will see you through, Sibling. Vigilance and a cool head."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_a_01","Tactically, our situation is less than sound."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_gas_a_02","This is not the battleground I would have chosen."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_a_01","I doubt these Hounds are properly trained. There lies our advantage."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_a_02","A trained Hound is a fearsome opponent. These beasts are of a lesser calibre."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_01","I concur. The peril is less than we might assume."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_c_hound_b_02","A reassuring sentiment, Sibling. Thank you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_01","That's ... unusually cheerful for you, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_02","Well said! Optimism is vital for good morale."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_01","Faith alone will not preserve us. Teamwork is all."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_02","Agreed. The hunters rely on surprise. How we react to that is our choice."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_01","I, at least, will not abandon you should you become lost."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_02","Keep your head! Panic serves no one and nothing."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_01","Wise words, associate, and aptly timed. "
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_02","Though I cannot believe I am saying this, we would do well to follow the Fanatic's advice. "
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_06_b_01","Much obliged. Good colleagues are hard to come by."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_07_b_01","It's in the spirit, if not the letter of the Lex Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_09_b_01","Most gracious of you, large associate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_13_b_01","I assure you, Tertium's normally more fragrant."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_14_b_01","It can also be a useful tool, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_15_b_01","A good enforcer both thinks and obeys."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_01_b_01","It would be well-earned, hefty associate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_07_b_01","Duty's something that chooses us, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_12_b_01","I admit, sometimes one must search for the satisfaction in some tasks..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_16_b_01","That seems likely."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_17_b_01","If we find someone who is, I certainly hope they're an ally."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_04_b_01","Yes. But don't remind me of it, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_08_b_01","Adequate backup perhaps?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_12_b_01","I refuse to enter a bar with you ever again after last time, Ogryn..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_16_b_01","[Disgusted Grunt] Throne's sake. I refuse to deal with that again. It's someone else's turn..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_20_b_01","Very astute, Ogryn. A professional cares for their tools."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_02_b_01","We may forge our value through duty, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_05_b_01","True enough. It's our lot, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_10_b_01","All too easily, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_11_b_01","I'll assume you mean the satisfaction of service, rather than anything sadistic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_20_b_01","I'm trying not to, sibling. Most unpleasant."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_02_b_01","I admit, this district's far from my former beat."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_05_b_01","It's anathema to any enforcer to abandon a comrade."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_10_b_01","Without care, nothing can thrive."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_11_b_01","Asleep or awake, just stay alert, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_20_b_01","Now, dreams without death and destruction would be a trick indeed..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_02_a_01","The beauty of the city is in its life. Would that you could see it as I do."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_04_a_01","It’s gratifying to be on patrol once again."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_05_a_01","Can I trust you'll cover me during the next onslaught?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_07_a_01","I spent so long barred from my duty, I almost forgot myself."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_08_a_01","Without duty, one has no purpose. Wouldn't you agree?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_09_a_01","Trust is our most valuable currency. I hope I’ve earned yours."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_10_a_01","It’s true that one can’t trust every Enforcer. I’ve learned that lesson. Painfully."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_10_b_01","It's a shame that brings a disgrace on the profession."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_a_01","Good Enforcers know their beat from the feel of the street. That’s something you can’t train."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_12_a_01","Good Enforcers care about the lives of citizens. Don’t forget that’s why we’re here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_13_a_01","Gird yourselves. I'm sure there's worse to come."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_14_a_01","How many of you actually know what protocol means?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_14_b_01","I'd been wondering the same thing..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_a_01","No citizen is above the Lex Atoma. You’d all do well to remember that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_16_a_01","One may take pleasure in a clean kill, but there should be no satisfaction found in suffering."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_17_a_01","Everyone is guilty of something, all Enforcers know that. Or can you say your conscience is clean?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_18_a_01","Is the Lex always just? Perhaps not, but it’s the best we’ve got."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_18_b_01","The instrument of justice is what we make of it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_19_a_01","This task calls for training and discipline. Respectfully, I believe our party lacks both."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_20_a_01","Some believe themselves above the Lex. Not every Enforcer realises, but it’s their duty to prove them wrong."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_02_b_01","Care for your equipment and it will care for you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_05_b_01","A fair if uninformative report, colleague."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_11_b_01","Your vigilance is misdirected, colleague."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_18_b_01","A calm head is an asset indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_20_b_01","A sentiment I would agree with. If some could just follow protocol..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_02_b_01","No duty should be considered light when citizens' lives are in the balance."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_05_b_01","I'll grant you, this duty weighs heavy."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_10_b_01","As a former agent of the law, I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_11_b_01","It certainly feels that way, associate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_18_b_01","I'm not sure that's tactically sound, or in line with approved protocol."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_20_b_01","I'm not sure that's factually accurate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_02_b_01","Crystal. And probably strategically wise..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_10_b_01","Quite the expert are you, Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_14_b_01","I concur. We must conserve ammunition."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_18_b_01","It's true that too many good are gone, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_02_b_01","I have to agree. I fear the darkness too, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_05_b_01","We are tools of justice, it's true."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_11_b_01","A preferable reward would be to live."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_15_b_01","Mercy and the Lex must exist in balance."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_18_b_01","I find logic a better ally than hope."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_20_b_01","I concur, this is a time for hard justice."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_02_b_01","How reassuring to know the enemy is so selective..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_05_b_01","There is nothing in death, but an end to duty."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_11_b_01","We must defeat them first, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_15_b_01","Righteousness invites conceit, which obstructs justice."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_18_b_01","Only a masochist glories in agony."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_20_b_01","Perhaps. But that's hardly a sustainable approach."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_02_b_01","It will take more than belief to see us through."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_06_b_01","I concur with the sentiment."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_10_b_01","A conscience is as efficient and less self-indulgent."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_14_b_01","Humbly, I believe I know this city better than you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_18_b_01","Do not drop your guard, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_01","These are dark days for Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_02","How did our betters not see this darkness descending?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_03","I feel eyes on us, always."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_04","How can this place be so full of evil?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_05","Remain vigilant, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_06","This mission tests our mettle."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_07","This duty will be a trying one."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_08","If only there were some protocol for this situation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_09","If we don’t have the Lex, we don’t have anything."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Focus on duty, and we may prevail."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","It means you are noteworthy, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","Like myself and my Siblings, you're considered interesting enough to be distinct from other humans."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","Economy in combat is good practice indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","I consider myself a capable shot, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","[sigh of disappointment] It's imperative you attend to your ammo supplies."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","It's imperative you deploy resources with care!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","I hope you intend to share that ammo."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Arm your associates, or else you'll fight alone!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","You should let your associates resupply their ammo."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","I choose to be prepared."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","Short-sighted on my part, apologies."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","This is a wearing situation for all of us, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","Rather attention-seeking of you to mention it, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Try to focus on the task, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","I sense it too.  Do not drown in the despair."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","A worthy ambition, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","The times change, and we must change with them."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Consider it respite, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","Use the time to attend to your weapons."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","Even so, I'd recommend caution."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","Despite that, it would be prudent to heal."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","An admirable attitude!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","An optimistic approach can be advantageous."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","I can't think why that's not standard protocol, Brute..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","An unconventional approach, but one you seem to deploy effectively..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","You'll adapt to the environs, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","A gratifying feeling, Sibling!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Commendable indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_a_01","Zealots try to forge humanity into their ideal, but enforcers work with the reality of what people are."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_a_02","Zealots may think they know the evil in human hearts, but enforcers are confronted with it daily."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_a_03","Enforcers do an imperfect job with imperfect tools, but at least they’re honest about it, unlike our zealot friends…"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Quite so, Sibling. Lose touch with humanity, and you lose your purpose."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Indeed, Our first duty is to justice. Would that the zealots be guided so…"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","I've found that a will to live is in fact conducive to continued survival."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","Pragmatism is useful, a death-wish is less so, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Ignore them Sibling, though I know it's hard."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","This place hosts a choir of corpses."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","You've told us of his legend before, but you tell it well, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","You mustn't endanger your associates so, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","That would not be tactically apposite."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","I'll take that as the jest I'm sure was intended."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","You can't run from duty, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","We are the defence, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","It's a heavy burden on our shoulders, on that we agree."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","In this city, you'd do better to fight like an enforcer."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","They serve their purpose, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","A disruptive strategy is sometimes advantageous."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Remember why it is we fight, Veteran."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Discipline and steel are nothing without faith and fortune, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","Perception's a matter of perspective, Sibling. Don't overthink it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","I recommend leaving that one to the Ecclesiarchy, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Drinking on duty is against protocol."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","How indulgent of you, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","I hope you're correct, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","We could certainly use His grace to rout this darkness."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","With that attitude, we are unlikely to prevail."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Atoma will not fall. She is too old and grand for that to happen."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","That's rather your department, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Quite. Would that your colleagues had flushed them out sooner!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","Conflict is the nature of life, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Humanity exists in hope, Sibling. Do not lose yours."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","We are all tools of justice, Sibling.  Morrow also."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","The world is uncaring, Sibling. It's down to us to ensure we survive."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","You should remedy that. Discomfort is a distraction."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Poor equipment leads to poor results."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","An irresponsible approach in an urban area."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","That's not a tactic we deploy near citizens, zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Focus, for your own good and ours, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Delivering justice, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","I'd tone it down around any Zealots, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","It's rather gauche to be so morbid, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","An unlikely team, but not entirely ineffective."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","I admit, being part of a unit once again is gratifying."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","If you didn't have the constitution of a rampant Grox, that would have been a terminal error, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","Their minds carry an unpleasant itch."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","We should detest whatever caused this, not the rotting victims."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Consider the needs of your associates!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Save that medicae for better use."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","I'd advise saving healing for when you really need it, associate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","I didn't realise you were a surgeon too, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","No need to be snide. If you need healing, just say."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Your associates are your home now, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","I'll need the opening note, but I wouldn't be averse to some music..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Be careful what you wish for, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","Enthusiasm and competence are not the same thing, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","Your satisfaction in duty is admirable, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Commendable enthusiasm, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","A novel idea, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","For physical prowess, you're already our champion."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_a_01","Our craftspeople are the most highly skilled in the sector. You’re aware of Moebian Iron? It’s made here. Superb."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_a_02","It’s a shame for our offworld associates that the markets are closed. The things our vendors can do with starch slabs! Quite unparalleled."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_a_03","It’s not to my taste, but the camelid racing on Atoma is said to be superlative. Absolutely riveting."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","The culture on Atoma is quite as impressive as its architecture!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","You're never alone, Sibling. Your associates are here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Focus on your associates, Sibling. We're still here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","You state the obvious, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","Yes, I rather think that's why we're all here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_a_02","Offworld associates may be unaware of Tertium’s thriving liturgical drama scene. Very highly regarded across the sector. Saint Messelina is central, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_a_03","I’m sure you must have heard of Saint Messelina? She is held in great esteem here. You should see Atoma during her festival!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","Some of our associates would surely benefit from seeing faith celebrated in such a way."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","Our gifts are both treasured and reviled, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","Very few blunts will ever care for our kind, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","So, you understand the tragedy, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","[disapproving grunt] It would be preferable if there were some of Tertium left after this."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","You cause enough damage as it is."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","This will be faster, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","Why the hesitance?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","It is prudent to galvanise ourselves."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","I concur Zealot. We must remember the importance of our work."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","I suspect... you would?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","Please, indulge yourself, zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Please, go ahead, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Some of us will need to remain alert, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","A question for the ages, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Together we're stronger than even the mightiest are alone, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Oddly, the foodstuff vendors I'd normally recommend are closed..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Please Sibling, have some professional courtesy."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","It's crass to probe one's colleagues, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Intelligence couldn't save me from betrayal, Ogryn. It's overrated."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","Oh, don’t take on so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","For once, Zealot, we are in accord."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","Leave? I'd no idea you were such a wit."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","There's no break from duty in this life, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","Wonderful! We have some very moving local dirges."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","I fancy I had a good voice in my scholam days."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Stay alert, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Sleep's for the dead Brute. Unless you want to join them, wake up!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","They do present a tactical challenge."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","Would that we had their numbers..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","Whilst observing tactical protocols, of course."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Yes. Provided we proceed according to protocol."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","For once, we agree Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","I concur. A more strategic approach would be preferable."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","You may wish to check your pungency before accusing others."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","I assumed it was the stink of your attitude, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_a_01","Tertium's the greatest planetary capital for three sectors, and I daresay the finest."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_a_02","I can think of no greater honour for my offworld associates than to be deployed in defence of the sector’s most magnificent settlement."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_a_03","I’m sure you’re aware of Tertium’s importance in the sector. She is a beacon for all humanity."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","It must be gratifying to be deployed in a place like Tertium. Still majestic, despite the war."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","I almost envy them experiencing the sight of her for the first time! Truly marvellous."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","Blunts rarely trust our kind enough for that, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","An admirable sentiment, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","Their dereliction of duty is a shame that will be punished."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","These Moebians are repellent - turning on the citizens they're meant to save."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Strange. I was wronged also, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","An injustice with which I sympathise."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","We've all faced betrayal, but paranoia is an indulgence we can ill afford. Get over it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","We must learn from betrayals, Veteran, not let them rule us. Mistrust is the easy option."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","A sentiment I broadly agree with, but the delivery is wanting."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","You know, loyalty and duty are not alien concepts to your colleagues, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Behave like enforcers, not soldiers. We want some of Atoma left."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","Your professionalism shames us all, I'm sure..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Your resolve is admirable, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","That's the spirit. Atoma will rise again!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Quite right. Weapons maintenance is a necessary protocol."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","Correct, Roughneck. Look after your tools, and they'll look after you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","If confessions were that easy, enforcers would be out of a job."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","When I worked in confessions zealot, I can tell you my methods were a little different..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","I hope that's so, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","If Him on Terra has come as backup, I'll not complain."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","I advise against drawing attention to yourself."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","If you need to withdraw, feel free to do so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__come_back_to_squad_01","We should stay together."
"loc_psyker_male_c__come_back_to_squad_02","Curiosity's laudable, but don't stray."
"loc_psyker_male_c__come_back_to_squad_03","Why are you leaving?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__come_back_to_squad_04","It would be best if you stayed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__come_back_to_squad_05","I strongly advise you remain."

"loc_psyker_male_c__come_back_to_squad_09","We'll be separated."
"loc_psyker_male_c__come_back_to_squad_10","Doesn't take a psyker to predict your end if you leave."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","I'd hoped the Emperor's Angels would grace us with their might, but it seems Atoma's fate lies in mortal hands."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","How reassuring... thank you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","Anyone know of the 'Cicatrix Maledictum'? I heard whisper of it at the Enforcers' Bastion."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","A disturbance in the Immaterium... no wonder we psykers feel a rising darkness."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","The rot runs deep in poor Atoma. Do you believe we'll neutralise it?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","Behold, the magnificence of Tertium. Each spire is its own world, each a tribute to the genius of humanity."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","I'd like news of Tertium's sister city.... but nobody will speak of it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","We need a new strategy!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","It is most resilient!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Take a tactical approach: hit it from behind!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Change up your tactics! Hit it from behind!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","A fine idea!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","I concur! Make it so!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","Zola is more professional than pleasant. That's preferable in my view."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Zola has focus. I respect that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","Mistake not determination for disrespect."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","Her mind is sharp. Do not mistake her focus for discourtesy."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","Throne knows we need an ally with some professionalism."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","We're better off with her formidable mind on our side."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","I believe the explicator may herself be from Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","A daughter of Atoma... that explains her determination."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Intriguing. Now I know where her grit comes from."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Perhaps judgements of faith should be left to Him on Terra, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","How gratifying for everyone you've an outlet for further theological discussion."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Careful. The Enforcers may confiscate that to verify the authenticity..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","Apropos of nothing, you should know Tertium takes relic falsification very seriously..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","Our pilot seems rather wayward."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I must confess, I find our pilot rather tiring."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I find her somewhat improper, verging on unsound."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","I'm not sure she knows what protocol actually means."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","We best hope she's more reliable that she seems."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","We don't have an abundance of alternatives..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_01","I have fascinating news. It's true, although you may not believe it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_02","You won't believe what I saw. Prepare for this information, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_03","Associates, I have a report so riveting you may not believe it!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_01_04","You know I never exaggerate? Prepare yourself for some news."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","The suspense is killing me, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","I'm prepared to suspend disbelief... for a time."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_01","Our pilot landed a mighty blow on the quartermaster!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_02","The quartermaster was knocked out cold... by our pilot!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_03","The quartermaster took a serious thrashing... from our pilot!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_03_04","Our pilot socked the quartermaster right between the eyes!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","I confess, I rather wish I'd seen that myself."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","I don't normally approve of hearsay... but that was gratifying."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_01","I confess, our pilot has since risen in my estimation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_02","What she lacks in discipline, she makes up for with tenacity."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_03","I believe you'll find Brunt somewhat chastened."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_05_04","Then I advise you not to get on the wrong side of our pilot's fist!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","Does something irk you, Veteran?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","What's caused that scowl, Roughneck?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Illegal gambling I take it? I'll pretend I didn't hear."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Gambling again? You're lucky I'm no longer on duty, Roughneck."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","This foe is a sturdy one!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","So tenacious! We must prevail!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Alter your tactics! Aim for the head!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Aim for the head! And don't give up!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Agreed! A sound strategy!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","I concur! Let it be done!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_01","Even my blunt associates must feel grief's burden upon the sergeant..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_02","Morrow's mind leaks grief. Even you must feel his mourning."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_03","Despite my discretion, I sense the dead comrades haunting Morrow."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_01_04","Morrow's memories are so thick with grief they're oppressive to even overhear."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","I've observed that. It consumes him."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","The sign of a strong conscience, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","I believe he sees in us reflections of his lost comrades..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","He is resilient. He suffers greatly, yet endures."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","The sergeant has lamentable manners."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","Morrow lacks politeness."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","He doesn't suffer fools gladly, associate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","He is merely resolute, associate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","I prefer my colleagues to be competent rather than charming."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","He's a professional. He's here to lead us, not charm us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Would you elaborate?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","That news hasn't reached Atoma... What of Xanatros?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","That explains the darkness that haunts him. This was in the service of the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","A dark undertaking... On behalf of the Inquisitor?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","Morrow's soul has borne much... that has certainly aged."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow's soul certainly appears to have lived a harder and longer life than his body..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Strange things can happen in the darkness of the Immaterium..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","His soul has felt the Warp-taint. Anything is possible."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","He still knows what duty is. That's what matters."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","He knows his duty. That's all I care."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","Colleagues... I find the Tech-Priest challenging."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","The Tech-Priest... I don't believe she is entirely professional."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","I find her mind grating... perhaps it's in need of oil."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","Her manners and attempts at humour are tactically suboptimal."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","I simply think we need to watch her."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Just... Alert me if she starts behaving even more oddly."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_02_01","My preference would be to focus on tactics, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_02_02","Very rousing. But perhaps consider prioritising protocol?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_02_01","An intervention from Him on Terra would be most welcome..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_02_02","If you could persuade Him on Terra to intercede about now, that would be ideal."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Convoluted language is the enemy of clarity, Fanatic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","If you want your preaching understood, consider using plain language."
"loc_psyker_male_c__cover_me_01","Cover me!"

"loc_psyker_male_c__critical_health_07","If I am to die, I will make it count."

"loc_psyker_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_09","Someone release me!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_10","Requesting release!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_01","The Rager is dead!"

"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_chaos_two_b_02","The existence of such a being would be a profanity. And a tactical nightmare..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Be thankful for the Astartes, surely the only warriors capable of fighting their dark counterparts..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_chaos_two_c_02","Their very existence is a heresy... I'd not mention this discussion to the Inquisitor."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_four_b_01","The terrible portal which spewed forth the Black Crusade that split the galaxy..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_four_b_02","A festering wound on the Materium, from which unreality oozes like blood..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_four_c_01","The daemonic gateway that finally destroyed Cadia, that lone bastion against the darkness."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_four_c_02","I envy you blunt associates, who did not have to hear the agonies of Cadia's fall."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_one_b_01","That would be preferable. Unfortunately, it's not true."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_one_b_02","Assume nothing when it comes to Daemons."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_one_c_01","I advise you remain cautious, and pray that we don't experience an incursion..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Ignore the whispers, and pray that Him on Terra holds off any Daemonic incursions."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_three_a_01","No blunt associates appreciate what Psykers endure to prevent Daemonic incursion..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_three_a_02","Daemonic assault is an ever-present risk. It takes great discipline to defend against it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_three_a_03","I hope I must never ask you to deploy anti manifestation protocols. They're mostly bullet shaped..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_three_a_04","I'm sure I could repel daemonic manifestation. I've trained for it. Theoretically, anyway..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_three_c_01","There's no need for alarm, associates. We Psykers are prepared in this regard."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_three_c_02","As we said at the scholam regarding Daemonic possession, fail to prepare,  prepare to fail."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_two_b_02","They say thousands of Adeptus Custodes died in the defence. A horror beyond belief."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_two_c_01","It is folly to speculate what might have been. We must take comfort in the victory."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_daemons_two_c_02","Of course the daemons would try to besiege Terra. It was inevitable, yet we prevailed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","Perhaps it is harder for blunts to appreciate his light as they cannot see it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","It is not a subject for discussion. There is a right answer, and an answer that gets you shot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","The Adepta Sororitas would provide formidable backup, unlikely though it is..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","I concur their tactics would align with the Ordo Hereticus... perhaps too well..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","They aren't known for their moderation...  more of Atoma may be left without their aid..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","I fear that in their zeal, the Adepta Sororitas may leave us with little of Atoma to rebuild..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_01","How must the Missionarus Galaxia feel, arriving on an isolated world. No idea if they'll find hope or horrors..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_02","They say some worlds who know nothing of Him on Terra. At least until the Missionarus Galaxia arrives..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_03","Imagine knowing nothing of humanity's war... Then the Missionarus Galaxia arrives to enlist you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_a_04","The Missionarus Galaxia must have illuminated some strange worlds with the knowledge of Him on Terra..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","It seems a strange use of resource when so many human worlds need aid..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","We already have many worlds in need of help... perhaps it would be better to start there."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","It's a long way to travel for an uncertain return."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","Each trip is a gamble, with resource we can little spare."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","I doubt Grendyl wishes our exploits to be disseminated..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","The key feature of a secret mission, is that it's secret. Keep it that way, Fanatic?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Atoma's fate is significant to us, but I imagine means little to Terra's High-Lords..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","Technically, myself. Although I'm a useful one, and tolerated. Up to a point..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","Anyone who deviates from expected norms in a way deemed unproductive, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","Given Him on Terra's abilities, perhaps it is blunts who should be considered deviants..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","If you don't consider Him on Terra to be a mutant, how do you define me so?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_01","Some Enforcer's methods are unsavoury... but the Ordo seems built on inhumanity."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_02","The Enforcers watch the people, The Arbites watch the Enforcers... who watches the Inquisition?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_03","I long to free Atoma's citizens, but the Inquisition heaps suffering upon suffering..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_a_04","I confess, the cruelty inherent in Inquisition's methods grate upon my conscience."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","I concur. If we're to save the citizenry, it would make sense to ensure some are left alive..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","Their protocols don't seem to allow for humanity, it's true..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","I've seen what happens when interrogators go too far. It serves none but the sadistic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Terrified citizens give the answer they think you want. Aren't we concerned with the truth?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","Oh? And you're an expert are you? Been through the training yourself? [disgusted snort]"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Educate yourself, Zealot. The Imperium takes no chances when it comes to my kind."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","How galling for you that without Psykers our Imperium would be unable to operate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","If you were to purge all Psykers, answer me this Zealot. Would you spare Him on Terra?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","The Indomitus crusade is a declaration of the Imperium's strength at the darkest of times..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","The Crusade is fighting to restore the Imperium."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","The crusade will focus on its work, as we must focus on ours."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","The spectacle of the crusade brings hope, it's true. But hope is not enough..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Cadia may have fallen, but its people never will."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","A terrible price... and yet, the Cadians still fight."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","Their bravery spurs the rest of humanity on to serve as best we can."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","Out of the ashes, comes the return of Roboute Guilliman. there is hope yet."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_01","The Great Awakening birthed many more Psykers. Maybe we'll become the majority..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_02","Numbers of Psykers have surged since the Great Awakening. Is humanity ready for them?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_03","Humanity must embrace Psykers, else miss the opportunity of the Awakening."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_a_04","More Psykers are born daily, since the Great Awakening. A great and terrible resource..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","It behoves us to care for these new psykers, not hunt them."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","It must be terrifying to  have lived one's life as a blunt, then awake one day as a Psyker..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","I remind you that without psykers, the Imperium could not operate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","Perhaps the Awakening is a gift from Him on Terra. We psykers are needed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","Those trapped there will need more than prayer..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","It is impossible to describe the horror of seeing the Astronomican falter... I felt I would die."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","They say a noble Commander oversees the Dark Imperium. Pray for his success..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Be thankful we have work to busy us here. It doesn't do to dwell on such darkness..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","It is gratifying to see our allies grow."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","It's fortuitous for Atoma that Grendyl commands such resource."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","I suspect there's no upper limit on the backup we'll need..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","Let's hope they are prepared for the ordeal ahead."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","I'd rather not know Grendyl's secrets..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","Some knowledge is classified for a reason. Be thankful you're not burdened with it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","We know enough to do our duty."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","We've enough to worry about. Let Grendyl take care of the rest."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_01","I admit, I'd like to see Grendyl lead from the front."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_02","Given the situation, I'm surprised that Grendyl hasn't come to personally take charge..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_03","Something troubles me... Grendyl speaks of Atoma's importance, yet stays away..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_a_04","If Atoma is considered tactically important, shouldn't Grendyl be here in person?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Agreed. I'd feel more confident knowing the Inquisitor was here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","Perhaps Grendyl's attentions are being stretched too thinly. Not a good sign for Atoma..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","I'm sure Grendyl has sufficient eyes and ears here to remain apprised of the situation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","We must trust that the resource Grendyl has allocated is sufficient..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","You conclude much, with little evidence. Ever considered a career in the Lex?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","That's perhaps not the insight you think it to be, Zealot. I doubt heretics last long in the Inquisition."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","As long as Atoma is delivered from ruin, I don't care what Grendyl believes."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","Faithful or not, do what Grendyl says, Zealot. The Inquisitor is Atoma's best chance."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_four_b_01","You never cease to surprise, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_four_b_02","It's gratifying to know she's clear to someone."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_four_c_01","I don't believe communication is her greatest strength..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_four_c_02","I confess I find her rather wearying."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I'm not convinced she prioritises souls over machines."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_one_b_02","We'll all need significantly more metal in our flesh before tech-priest respects us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_one_c_01","We're on the same side, even if we're simply meat to her."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_one_c_02","I'd judge she has a few cogs loose, but still has utility."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_a_01","The Tech-Priest's mind moves in strange, mechanical ways."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_a_02","The Tech-Priest's mind is unlike anything I've seen. Unnervingly symmetrical..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_a_03","The resonances of the Tech-Priest's mind are rather...discordant."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_a_04","The Tech-Priest's thoughts smell of electrical storms. Most uncomfortable."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Engage discreetly, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Please remember protocol, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_c_01","It's protocol to screen new Enforcers. This is no different."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_three_c_02","It's what they call due diligence. You may not have heard of it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Her soul's hard to read, but I'm inclined to agree, it is aged."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_two_b_02","It's traced through with machinery, but her soul indeed appears old."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_two_c_01","So many years in which she could have learned the art of being agreeable..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hadron_two_c_02","As long as she's still human enough to remember she fights for humanity..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","I hear it's not the kind of job one does for long..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","It's not the kind of work that makes you popular with Enforcers..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","You'd best remain, Brute. You can't put a price on good associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Your continued presence would be advantageous for all parties."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The purser? What do you know?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Gossip is unprofessional and I cannot condone it. Mission-critical intel however..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","She'd be a valuable asset in the interrogation chamber, that's for sure."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","I'm fairly certain my Enforcer colleagues would like a closer look at some of her weaponry..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_01","The purser's prices aren't in line with city ordinances, I can tell you that much..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_02","The purser's prices should be against the Lex. In fact, they might be."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_03","My offworld associates should note, the purser's prices are exorbitant."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_a_04","I wonder if the purser realises how close her gouging of prices brings her to breaking the Lex?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","We've a particular division of Enforcers who would be very interested in the racket she's running here..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","Her prices are extortionate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","Dishonest Enforcers have been known to simply confiscate what they want. Perhaps they aren't entirely wrong..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","I shall ensure my former colleagues are made aware of this enterprise..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","At least she's straightforwardly anarchic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","I doubt one would last long in such a position without having an edge."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","She is what she needs to be to survive... which is analogous with being entirely ruthless."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She's to be respected, but not trusted."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","The Highborn. Free from trouble, and mostly free from the Lex."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Those in our society who believe themselves above the Lex. And often, unfortunately, are."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","I can't tell you what I'd give to see the Lex burn through those vaunted spires..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","Duty should come with privilege.  Not every highborn remembers that..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","You leave civilian matters to the Enforcers. The last thing this city needs is your heroics..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","Don't think nobody is watching, Veteran. This beat is well trodden."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","The gangers here are tame compared to some hives... trust me!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","They're part of Atoma's ecosystem. Doesn't mean we have to like them..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_a_02","Life in a Hive City is hard, but it means something. We are all striving for Him on Terra."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_a_03","I pity those who don't live in Hive Cities. There are some feral worlds without any at all!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_a_04","Perhaps I'm biased, but I believe Hive Cities are the most perfect form of habitation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","I hear that some hives are infested with sump beasts. Disgusting!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Some hives, which I shan't mention, are plagued by parasitic slime. Very unhygienic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Atoma's manufactorums are the best in the sector."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Atomans are rightly proud of their industrial output - this is a planet of makers."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","The skill of the workers is as valuable as the factorum - and harder to rebuild."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","The workers are one of Atoma's greatest assets too, not just the Metalfab."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_four_b_02","The Bell of Lost Souls cannot ring for all of those who die in service, Brute, else it would never stop..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Our deaths will go unmarked, save by Him on Terra. That's worthier than any bell, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_four_c_02","How you did matters more than if your death is commemorated."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_one_b_02","I suspect it would not be an enjoyable trip for myself or my siblings..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_one_c_01","To witness the atmosphere of that sacred place... would be humbling indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_one_c_02","To be so close to Him-on-Earth... an honour my kind would unlikely be afforded."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_three_a_01","I reckon Atoma will be in no position to pay her Tithe for a while..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_three_a_02","Death and tithes are the only certainties.. yet I hope Atoma's given leniency in the latter..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_three_a_03","A tithe on Atoma would seem an unfair burden given current circumstances..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_three_a_04","Atoma's Imperial Tithe... do you think it will be waived given the war?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_three_b_01","It must be for the good of all... there's no benefit to Atoma if she's tithed now..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_three_c_01","For a Governor to resist the tithe seldom ends well."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_three_c_02","We've an obligation to the Imperium, yes... but are we, the people, not also the Imperium?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_two_b_02","The thought of so many souls is deafening."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_two_c_01","I have wondered how things might be elsewhere, under strange stars."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_imperium_two_c_02","A million worlds, and people are the same on all of them... an exhausting thought."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","An assassin needs a target... we can't very well just point them at Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","The Officio Assassinorum? That's using a knife when we need a flamethrower."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","They are death incarnate. Pray you never meet one..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Their terrible wealth of knowledge is  almost as fearful as their blades..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","It's very distasteful that you'd even raise that in front of me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","I'm quite appalled you think that a suitable topic for discussion!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","Putting aside the crassness of this discussion, Atoma's more valuable intact."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","And destroy the source of Moebian Iron? Good luck armouring your ships without us..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_01","Whilst the Inquisition's above it, I'd ask that you still respect the Lex Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_02","The Inquisition stands apart from Imperial Law... I confess, that is uncomfortable for me..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_03","The Inquisition is above Imperial Law. I wonder if it should be..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_a_04","The Inquisition's above Imperial Law, but you're not. Not while I'm around, anyway."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","As long as I'm here, the Lex Atoma still applies. Understand?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","With such power, comes the need to comply with protocol."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","Pity we've no time to correct the less principled enforcers ..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","I could've used this power in the enforcers. With certain officers, anyway..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","To destroy corruption without fear or favour... I can see the appeal."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","To make the corrupt answer for their crimes... the true enforcer's dream."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","In any investigation, one must know when to stop. I'm not sure the zealous always do..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","If some in the Ordo had their way, my kind would not be seen as Imperial citizens."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","I imagine that is a closely-guarded secret, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","It requires souls, Brute. And it is very old. That's all I can tell you..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Let's hope someone understands its workings. Without it, we've no hope."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","They say the Throne requires more and more souls as time goes on..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","I've heard his tactical genius still guides military protocols to this day."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","He strove for the expansion of the Imperium, did he not?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","His end was strange, if I recall correctly..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","Was he not halted by psychic horrors of the Halo Zone?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_01","We're doomed to repeat the errors of the past if we refuse to learn from them."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_02","It is illogical to deprive ourselves of past knowledge, do you not agree?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_03","Without examining the past, we can never learn from it. This seems inefficient."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_a_04","Surely a greater heresy than learning from history, is ignoring it?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","Him on Terra gave us the wit to learn from history. We should do so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","The best tacticians learn from experience. It's reckless to disregard our past..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Whatever you believe, it's reckless not to equip ourselves with knowledge."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","Him on Terra is the greatest innovator humanity has known... shouldn't we emulate him?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","A dark time, but one which birthed both the Ordo Hereticus, and Adepta Sororitas."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","The say astropaths can still hear the screams of Vandire's forces..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","We should focus on our own times, lest they exceed the darkness of the past."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Simply because evil has gone before, we should not accept the darkness of our own age."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_four_b_01","Astutely observed, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_four_b_02","Grim dedication, or loyalty? I do not know."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_four_c_01","He seems focused to a fault."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_four_c_02","I find it hard to believe a bureaucrat like Melk can truly understand the reality of field operations..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_one_b_01","To clarify... You mean Lord Darius Melk, a scion of the noble House Straxamus?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_one_b_02","If you're referring to Sir Darius Melk, Lord of the Quartervast, then you may wish to heed your tone."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_one_c_01","How very deferential of you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_one_c_02","I've found credentials earned in the field are more indicative of skill than those entitled by birth..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_a_01","Melk's diligence is obsessive. Almost... guilty, to my eye."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_a_02","I've an Enforcer's eye for lawbreakers. If Melk isn't one now, I'll wager he has been."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_a_03","An honest citizen doesn't treat with lawbreakers. There's more to Melk than meets the eye..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_a_04","Take it from me. Melk has secrets, I can feel their weight..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_b_01","He wouldn't be in his current position otherwise, I'm certain, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_b_02","His secrets are between him and the Inquisitor. We'd do best to remain ignorant of them."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_c_01","His knowledge must be valuable to Grendyl, or he wouldn't be here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_three_c_02","I wonder at the motley crew Grendyl has assembled. Whether desperation or genius is behind it, I do not know..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_two_b_01","It's a little rich that Lord Melk of all people upbraid you for pomposity..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_two_b_02","Your diction is grating Zealot, but Lord Melk is a hardly paragon of clarity..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_two_c_01","Melk's function is to communicate. Perhaps you could learn from him, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_melk_two_c_02","If it's of any comfort, Fanatic, I imagine further clarity would in fact hinder your cause..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_four_b_01","We've enough to deal with without you introducing such fictions, Brute!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_four_b_02","If that were the case, I hardly think he'd be allowed to live."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_four_c_01","We should refrain from such hearsay, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_four_c_02","It speaks volumes that you seek such an explanation for Morrow's focus..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_one_b_01","A legend perhaps, but one befitting the man."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_one_b_02","Unlikely, perhaps, but of any of this crowd I could believe it of Morrow."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Let's hope he can bring the experience of his long life to bear in liberating Atoma..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_one_c_02","Morrow has lived many lifetimes. Badab or not, he's a worthy ally."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_a_01","I wish there was some clarity about Morrow's past. Some of the details seem improbable."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_a_02","I trust Morrow, yet I'd prefer if we knew the details of his past..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_a_03","Morrow's past is tangled... would that we could unpick it and separate truth from lie."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_a_04","If we knew more about Morrow we could quash some of the more outlandish rumours about him..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_b_01","I suggest not attending to hearsay in the first place, Sibling."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_b_02","I concur. A little transparency would make our job easier."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_c_01","I can't believe that Morrow is spinning his own fiction..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_three_c_02","There's no smoke without a fire. Morrow has seen things beyond reckoning... the details are irrelevant."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Morrow's only one man, and yet seems to have been present at every battle in history..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Then Morrow seemingly possesses the gifts of both immortality and time-travel..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Of all the Inquisitor's warband Morrow has the gravitas to make the rumours half-believable..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_morrow_two_c_02","whichever wars he's a veteran of, he's survived them, and is therefore to be heeded."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Her flamboyance belies her true nature."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","She is reassuringly powerful."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","She's a tool, and a tool is only as good as its wielder."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","I sense we'll need more Mourningstars for what lies ahead."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Rannick is a thinker, not a fighter, Ogryn. He'd be little help in the field."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_four_b_02","His mind is what's of use to us, Ogryn. It's best kept safe on the Mourningstar."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_four_c_01","His strategies have proved effective. I see no reason to question them."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_four_c_02","I wish he'd visit Atoma once, if only to see what he is fighting for..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Don't take it personally. Rannick's a professional."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_one_b_02","Frankly, it's a relief to work with a professional like Rannick."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_one_c_01","I'd be worried if an Interrogator gave his trust easily."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_one_c_02","A trusting Interrogator is a dead Interrogator."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_a_01","I hear that great things are destined for Interrogator Rannick..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_a_02","Rannick will go far. You don't need to have heard the rumours to see that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_a_03","Have you heard the whispers of Rannick's anticipated elevation?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_a_04","Rannick's on a fast track to Inquisitor, mark my words."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_b_01","So long as he finishes his work on Atoma before leaving us for his bright future..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Grendyl no doubt sees Atoma as a test for his Interrogator. His fate is tied to ours."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_c_01","He certainly has an incentive to deliver Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_three_c_02","Let's hope his ambition provides incentive enough to save us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_two_b_01","One might consider the greatest expression of faith to be duty. You cannot fault him in that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Service is purely faith in action, Zealot. You should consider that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_two_c_01","Whatever his motivation, his deeds serve Him on Terra."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_rannick_two_c_02","I doubt the Ordo tolerates the faithless..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_servitors_one_b_01","They are simply tools, as are we all."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_servitors_one_b_02","It is comforting to know that service continues, even after life does not."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_servitors_one_c_01","They serve without pain or fatigue. An easier lot than ours."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_servitors_one_c_02","Why shouldn't the Imperium use our bodies when we no longer have need of them?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","They're wrought differently to us, Brute. To withstand the things they must do."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","They're designed to be weapons, Brute. Not all survive..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","They are fearsome. Whilst I'd like their aid, I believe we'd be as flies to them..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","I wonder how they'd see us. Feeble, brief creatures, I suspect."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","I've heard the Adeptus Astartes have a... strained relationship with Psykers."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","The Emperor's Holy Angels have a peculiar attitude to Psykers, given their father..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","Are they the best option for a world we'd like to keep intact?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_01","They say Roboute Guilliman's returned.  Throne, I hope it's true..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_02","They say Roboute Guilliman's Lord Commander now. Emperor's Teeth, I hope so..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_03","If Roboute Guilliman truly has returned, humanity may yet prevail."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_a_04","They say one of the Emperor's sons, Roboute Guilliman, has returned. Dare we believe it?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","The hope his return brings is like a bright flame in the darkness."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","He has come in the Imperium's darkest hour... let's hope he's not too late..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","I believe it's true. I feel that something in the galaxy has moved in our favour..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","I believe he's back. Striding Godlike out of the mists of time, into the fight for humanity."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","Not all comply with the Codex, Zealot."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","Many take the Codex as guidelines, rather than rules..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Like any protocol, the Codex must act as guidance, not dictate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","The Codex must be a means to an end, not an end in itself."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","I've only imagined  how his mind would appear. Blinding, terrifying, sublime..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","I suspect his mind is now more representative of his magnificence than his physical form..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","They say that those who die righteously will look upon his face..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","I believe his visage would be as terrible and beautiful as his mind..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","He might choose to speak psychically to those of us you call freaks..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","I suspect Blunts could only experience a shadow of his words' splendour..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","It's the High Lords of Terra who enact his will."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","The High Lords of Terra are the instruments of Him on Terra."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_a_01","It is discomfiting to think of the number of souls Him on Terra must consume every day..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_a_03","The souls the Emperor daily consumes is a terrible price for humanity..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_a_04","I believe the souls the Emperor consumes must be a terrible agony to him..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","The Astronomican is a terrible necessity... a beacon wrought from death."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","The Astronomican's price is death, but its absence would mean annihilation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","Many know the Astronomican's price, but few weep for the Psykers who pay it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","There's a guilt to surviving the Astronomican's hunger. There but by the Emperor's grace..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","The agony he has endured for millennia is beyond comprehension..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","His watch never ends... the Golden Throne must seem little more than a prison."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","You blunts cannot imagine the terrors that await should the Emperor falter..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","I wonder what Him on Terra would think of humanity's fate could he see it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","Ingenuity and faith, Ogryn. Both are required."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Never trust anyone who claims to tell you how it works, Ogryn. Nobody really knows."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Without psykers, there would be no warp-travel, no Imperium."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","I believe the less you know, the more comfortable you'll find the journey."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","Our blunt associates cannot imagine a Psyker's ordeal on entering the Warp..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","If only the things you fear in the Immaterium were restricted to it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","Thank the Emperor for the ability of the Navigators who guide us safely..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_a_01","The disorder the Empyrean wreaks upon the passage of time is most perturbing..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_a_02","It seems to me that time becomes more disrupted every time one travels the Warp..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_a_03","I wonder what causes the Warp's distortion of time? Something unholy, no doubt..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_a_04","Almost worse than its entities, is the way that the Warp alters time..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","It is a discomfiting sensation, indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","It's the irregularity I find objectionable. You never know what it will deal you..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","The peril is most acute for those like myself and my siblings [shudder]"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","Would that there was an alternative to voyaging this sea of nightmares..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","You think you know the true horrors of the Warp, Zealot?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","Blunts are protected from the worst depredations of the Empyrean. Be thankful for that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","This is why proper protocols around the maintenance of Gellar fields are so crucial."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","Don't dwell on any scratching at the hull you may hear. That way lies madness..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","A wise approach, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","An astute judgement, Ogryn!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","You're behaving with more professional decorum than some, Ogryn."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","There's no shame in friendship, Ogryn. Her gifts came from Him on Terra, after all."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","If an ally alarms you so, how will you fare in the field?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Have you considered growing a backbone? That may help."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","This hysteria is unbecoming, even for you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Can you at least pretend to act with some professional courtesy? Sefoni is a colleague."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_a_01","It is gratifying indeed to converse with Sefoni."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_a_02","We're fortunate to have such an accomplished Psyker in Sefoni."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_a_03","I thought the art of conversation had been lost... until I spoke with Sefoni!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_a_04","I'm glad of Sefoni's company. She's very insightful."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","She's an asset indeed. And coincidentally, also very charming."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","A breath of fresh air. Never a bore, unlike some of our associates..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","She uses her blessings from Him on Terra to your benefit, whether you appreciate it or not."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Despite your judgements, she does her utmost to help. That's professionalism."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","You realise that you shun abilities bestowed by Him on Terra?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","I can see how that would be humiliating for you. My sympathies."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Take it up with the Inquisitor if you'd like to complain."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","If you're unwilling to train properly, you put all of us at risk."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_01","I admit, it will take me a while longer to adjust to orbital drops."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_02","Are orbital drops always this unpleasant, or is our pilot to blame?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_03","The Valkyries seem to be designed for maximum discomfort during deployment..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_a_04","Are orbital drops such an ordeal due to our pilot, or the valkyries? Or indeed, both?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Nobody seems to have considered the disbenefits of violently agitating one's operatives during deployment..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","I suspect Masozi could make things smoother... if she wanted to."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Perhaps we'll become accustomed to it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","It may be necessary, but we don't have to like it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_war_end_b_01","That's up to us, Brute."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_war_end_b_02","It must, Ogryn. One way or another."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_war_end_c_01","We must focus on our part. If everyone does theirs, we stand a chance."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_war_end_c_02","War, like crime, is ever present. We can't beat it, but we can control it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Xenos are like a disease... It wouldn't surprise me if some could do such a thing."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_four_b_02","With xenos, anything is possible."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_four_c_01","Xenos can appear as humans? Troubling indeed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_four_c_02","Humanity has enough to worry about without fearing xenos walking among us..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_one_b_01","You've faced such monsters, Roughneck? Admirable."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_one_b_02","I thank Him on Terra I've never encountered such horrors."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_one_c_01","I've heard some xenos are very ancient. Older than the stars..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_one_c_02","I've never seen one, but their impounded tech is formidable enough."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_three_a_02","There are those who think we can learn from the xenos... their tales never end well."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_three_a_03","How to use xenos technology safely... nobody's mastered that trick yet."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_three_b_01","I heard one Inquisitor retained a Kroot Mercenary with a sharp beak and a taste for flesh! A fiction, of course..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_three_b_02","We once impounded a ring containing an armour-piercing laser. The probator said it was crafted by a furry, orange ape!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_three_c_01","I hear there's a xenos that exists as a single hivemind. Imagine! No need for the lex..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_three_c_02","We impounded a shipment of T'au tech at our Bastion. Filthy, but I tell you, I've never seen sensors like it..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_two_b_01","They are a psychic race, are they not? Perhaps they are not as unknowable as they seem..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_two_b_02","I wonder if the Great Rift pains them as it does us..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_two_c_01","They are not our foe here, compelling as their downfall may be."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_xenos_two_c_02","We should focus on the enemy at hand, entertaining as these tales are."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_four_b_01","She's loyal too."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_four_b_02","Her dedication is evident, that's true Ogryn,"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_four_c_01","She has a strong mind. She'd not have lasted so long otherwise..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_four_c_02","She's fighting for Atoma. That's all I need to know."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_one_b_01","The Inquisitor thinks of the war first, but the explicator thinks of the people."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_one_b_02","The explicator seeks justice for Atoma's citizens. We need allies like her."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_one_c_01","She knows the meaning of duty, and she cares about justice. That's enough for me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_one_c_02","This war is personal for the explicator. I trust her more because of that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_three_a_01","Zola's ambition is threaded with fear. Not a bad balance, I think."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_three_a_02","She hides it well, but our explicator isn't from uphive. I suspect she started as low as one can..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_three_a_03","I suspect our explicator has crossed paths with my enforcer associates in the past..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_three_b_01","She bears a burden of care the others do not."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_three_b_02","She must balance serving the Inquisitor with serving Atoma. It may be difficult."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_three_c_01","I suspect she may find herself at odds with Rannick's methods..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_three_c_02","She balances much. I judge that she does so well..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_two_b_01","She doesn't allow talk of faith to distract her. A lesson for you?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_two_b_02","Then perhaps consider that you don't have a monopoly on faith, Zealot..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_two_c_01","She manifests her faith through service. And does so quietly, unlike some."
"loc_psyker_male_c__lore_zola_two_c_02","From wherever her dedication stems, I am grateful for it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","A heavy load."
"loc_psyker_male_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","I can ... barely lift it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_alarm_01","The alarm controls cannot be far!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_alarm_02","There will be an alarm cut-off beyond the substacks."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","The archivum appears to be in lockdown."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","I fear Archivum Sycorax is in lockdown."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","Imagine what we could achieve were this place to fully serve the Lex Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Record keeping is vital to good governance. I approve."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Traitors often shield themselves from the Lex and yet can be anywhere."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","I pray to the Emperor we will find these traitors."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","This archivum feels like a fortress. "
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Strong walls. An army of servitors. A bastion of knowledge."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","Heh. Not Throneside's prettiest aspect."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Even where there is wealth, there is ordure."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","I suggest we commandeer this train."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Why don't we requisition this train?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","As long as the options have been considered."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Seems strategically sound."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","So, what's your role in all of this, Tech Priest?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","What brought you aboard the Mourningstar, Tech-Priest?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Curiously defensive... one needn't be an enforcer to find that suspect."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","As cold as your exterior. Consistent, at least."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Where's the backup?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","The backup better be here soon."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","They'd better be quick if they're coming."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","We have to proceed, backup or not."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","Look at this labour. As sacred as any litany."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","See this dedication associates? Perhaps consider your own work ethic..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","I admit, I've lost track of our location."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","I confess, I'm not sure of the next turn..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_something_big_01","I sense distress and desperation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_something_big_02","There is a foul tang in the air... death and fear are thick here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Are these professional soliders?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","These troops don't seem especially professional."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","I won't cry for the Water Cartel. I've seen too many of their victims..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","I've seen enough of the Water Cartel's dead. Now I can hear them..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","I concur, explicator. I think they're finished."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","They may be finished, but the legacy of their pain remains."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Would that the enforcers had toppled the cartel as fast as the heretics did..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","I'll bet the Water Cartel made easy prey. So much rivalry within..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Very insightful, explicator. You should have been an enforcer."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","I saw it many times when I worked with the enforcers."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","It's gratifying to see a daughter of Tertium rise so far as to become an explicator."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Might I ask how our explicator rose so far from her humble beginnings?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","A sentiment I understand."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","Take it from one who knows, there's no glory in stubborn solitude."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_insignia_01","My only regret on the Water Cartel is that they destroyed themselves before we could."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_insignia_02","The Water Cartel's sigils lasted longer than they did..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","This is Atoman ingenuity too, but not the sort that is publicised."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","They're filtering the water for scraps. Would that they did not have to."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","The habs here require some maintenence, it's true."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","I think that a well-used building is indicative of character. Do mind the loose slabs, though."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Criminals should know not to trust one another..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","Perhaps the best tactic is to wait for them to wipe each other out."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_shanty_01","Do not judge the citizenry. They don't choose to live this way."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_shanty_02","Would that Atomans were not obliged to live this way..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_water_course_01","I advise against direct contact with the water."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cartel_water_course_02","I think you'll find that this is water. Technically."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","The elevator is on its way. Fortitude, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","We hold here until the elevator arrives! Agreed?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Comms-plex. Mourningstar. Something here does not add up."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","I sense conspiracy in this mission. Tell me I'm wrong."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","""Incorruptible"" is merely a word, it seems."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","An investigation is warranted, and doubtless already underway."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","Can you tell us anything about who is receiving this message?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","Is everything about the transmission's target to remain secret?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","I accept your answer."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","I see. Most interesting. Knowledge is so very valuable."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","I trust we carry vital news?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","We carry important intel, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","It is strange how war often turns on the smallest numbers."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Then it shall be delivered. Lives are at stake."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","I dislike starting a mission without the full facts."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","A team is only as good as the information provided to it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_way_in_01","This approach will serve, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_complex_way_in_02","I believe this is the entrance we seek."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","I'm no Tech-Priest, but this looks beyond repair."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Can this be fixed? It looks ruined."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","If you want us to know what you're talking about, you need to speak plainly."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Affirmative would suffice. If that's what you meant..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The loss of the workers pains me. So many citizens, gone."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Without workers, the factory is nothing. Their loss is a wound in the city."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","You forget that machines are nothing without hands to operate them."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","These workers were skilled citizens. They are not interchangeable."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Whilst I wish all of Tertium to be saved, this seems a lot of effort for a single manufactorum..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Atoman manufacture is outstanding, but Rannick places much value on this one facility..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","As clear as ever. Well, we know our duty."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","The manufactorum will not fall on our watch."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_heat_01","The temperature is not conducive to our mission..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_heat_02","I don't think my lungs were designed to operate in these temperatures..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Time to leave. Most gratifying."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_leaving_02","I confess, it will be a relief to leave this place."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Keep going, and don't look down."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Stay back from the edge, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Associates, don't touch any levers. Please."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","Try to ignore the heat. We must push on to Coolant Control."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_production_line_01","See this armour plating? Moebian steel. Superior to anything else."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_production_line_02","You're looking at more than armour plating. This, is the pride of Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Do you see this? The workers even sleep here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","The workers sleep by their stations. That's Atoman loyalty."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_deception_01","I find deceit disagreeable, but needs must."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_deception_02","I dislike these underhand tactics, but if I must ..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","They can deface the station, but they can't escape justice."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","So familiar, but so changed. They will pay for this."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","I dread to think what befell my enforcer associates..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","What must it have taken for the enforcers to abandon their posts?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","You try maintaining justice in a place like this."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Squeezed by criminals above and below. Who'd be an enforcer?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Your thoughts tell me you may not be unfamiliar with places like this, explicator."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Spent time in a cell, explicator? Your thoughts suggest so..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Maybe try to think less loudly on the subject."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","It's counterproductive to bury such feelings."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","A prison seems an ironic place for criminals to hide."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Our target hides in a prison... seems like a taunt."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Look at the legs on that hab... ingenious!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","See how the hab is raised? A marvel of engineering."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","Insalubrious as it may be, isn't it impressive?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","Setting aside the smell, isn't it majestic?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","This wouldn't have been top of my list for a tour of Tertium..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","This is not the sort of filth I'm accustomed to dealing with..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","A shame to see the shops abandoned."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","I've never seen the market so quiet..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","That hab's underpinning may need maintenance..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","That hab looks awry."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_alive_01","It's working! The Smelter stirs!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_alive_02","The Machine spirit wakes!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","There is something different about this place. This is about more than tanks..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Atoman tanks are special, yes, but there must be something else about this place..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","You're talking about Moebian Steel. Please use the correct terminology..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Of course we know about Moebian Steel. Atoma is famous for it. But what else is there?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I wonder if our Tech Priest associate would tell us something about herself?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","It's beneficial for a squad to know one another. Tech Priest, would you tell us about yourself?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","I'm not sure how much we learned, but it's a start."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","The effort is appreciated, even if the content was incomprehensible."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I confess, the lack damage here makes me wonder the enemy's intent..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The manufactorum seems strangely intact..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","So, they intend to spoil the fruits of Atoma's forges."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Desecration. They will not use Atoma's own arms against her."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","We must locate the smelter."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Any intel on the smelters location?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Temperature's rising. Time to go, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_hellhole_02","If we don't move out, we're going to cook."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_lifeless_01","It is chilling to see the place so still."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_lifeless_02","I never thought I'd see these engines stilled."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","The front-gate wouldn't be my first choice..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","A frontal assault? Without backup? Why am I not surprised."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_propaganda_01","This is where the hands of the Imperium labour for all humanity."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_propaganda_02","The workers contribution to the Imperium is equal to that of any guardsman."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Incoming! Hold the line, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Hostiles sighted. Ready yourselves!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","Try not to breathe deeply..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Foundry-flavour. My favourite..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Something tells me this place is significant."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","My instincts tell me there is more to this manufactorum than meets the eye..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_hack_01","Interrogation was my specialism. Admittedly of people, rather than machines."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_hack_02","Unlike those of flesh and blood, machines seldom deceive themselves."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","The heretics betray their city to live like this?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","The enemy cannot be well-resourced if they live this way..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","I sense something foul nearby..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Be alert, associates. Something awful is close..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","How are we expected to operate without proper briefing?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","That oversight is a total dereliction of briefing protocol!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","We'd be better equipped to fight this daemon if we knew why it was here..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I don't understand why the daemon chose this place."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Perhaps the zealot has the right idea about heretics after all..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Then I'm inclined to agree with the zealot's approach. Let's burn them all."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Can you confirm the daemon is restricted to this area?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Please confirm the daemonic influence hasn't spread."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Then we must fight harder. It cannot prevail."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","So it violates my city further... It will burn for that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","So, we'll take the stairs then?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","It may be tactically advantageous to take the stairs."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Surely they cannot manipulate us using the vox?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","I cannot believe it is possible to transmit a psychic pathogen..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Watch your footing. Atoma's a long way down..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","It's not often citizens like ourselves reach such an elevated position..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","I'm certain there must be a more direct route..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","It would have more efficient to air-drop us, surely?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Is this what they call fresh air? They can keep it up-spire if so."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","The air's so thin! Give me downhive fog, anyday."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","It's beautiful in the sunlight, don't you agree, associates?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Look at the view? Even you must see Tertium's beauty now."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","The doors, they're sealed!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","I fear we have been locked in!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","Locked in! This was an ambush!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","We are sealed in. A regrettable development!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Mourningstar, requesting instructions ... Curses, this vox isn't working!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","No signal from Mourningstar. We're on our own."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","My vox is dead. The heretics must be jamming the signal."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Mourningstar? Mourningstar! It's no good. The vox isn't working."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","We fight on and hope for an opening."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","Disagreeable. But we are not dead yet."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","This is less than ideal. But we fight on, agreed?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","Stand ready. Let us make the heretics pay for their cleverness!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_01","Relay's here! Take out the skyfire before it does any more damage."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_disable_skyfire_a_02","Disarm the relay, associates, and we take out the skyfire turrets."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_district_gate_01","How many citizens are trapped behind the District Gate?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_district_gate_02","District Gate's sealed. No way out for those citizens..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","This place is symbolically important... but strategically?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","So, has the Logistratum become tactically significant?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","That would be advantageous."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Would that we  had the resource to take it now..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","You're suspiciously well-acquainted with this area, explicator."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Only servitors know a place like this intimately.  And you're neither, explicator..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","And that's all I want to hear about your illegal activities thank you."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","I'd like to know where this special-issue ammunition is being deployed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Special-issue ammo... This could give us the upper hand."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","That is rather frustrating."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Does Rannick not appreciate the importance of our duty?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","This place is too quiet."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","The entire hab block has been sealed... I don't like it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","I suppose it's a covert approach..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Perhaps this approach will teach some of you discretion..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_trains_01","At least the trains are still operational."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_rails_trains_02","The heretics have managed to keep the trains working..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Ah, I have patrolled such streets many times."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","This takes me back to better days. And worse."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Ah. This Skylink is clearly ill-maintained."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","Surely the bridge should be moving faster?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","Let us hope the name is not prophecy. I have much yet to achieve."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","I do not seek martyrdom this day. Or any day."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","A simple enough assignment, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","Done ... So long as we survive long enough."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","This could go on for some time."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","They do not seem at all disheartened, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Maintain discipline! We can win this!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Keep your heads. We must work as a team!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","I see a space designated for uplifting preaching, but I shudder to think of where its occupant is now."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","The pulpit is empty. I can only hope the preacher fled in time."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","Another crime to avenge."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","These are lawless times. No one is safe."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","It may look more civilised than elsewhere, but do not be fooled."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Justice is no more commonplace here than below."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_retrieve_01","I fear we have heavy lifting ahead, colleagues."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_retrieve_02","Associates? Who wants to do the heavy lifting?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scan_01","Ensure no harm comes to the servo-skull. It is a versatile tool."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scan_02","Gathering data? [Grunt] Reminds me of the old days."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","A little Atoman sunlight will raise our spirits, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Look associates! Here's some Atoman sunlight to cheer your moods."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Even I don't recognise this place. How long has it been left this way?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","For how long has this place been lost to the city?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","It is melancholy to see the city eat itself this way..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Perhaps its time will come again."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Why are the heretics sowing plague? It must be about more than malice..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Surely our enemy could have picked one... plague or heresy? both seem overindulgent."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","That sounds ominous."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","I suspected as much. There is nothing so repellent in nature..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I believe this used to be a trading port. Full of people, full of life."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","This was once a trading zone, alive with the buzz of merchant craft. All gone now."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","It can be restored. If we have the will."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","We should hope those days come again."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_interior_01","This doesn't look as stable as originally intended."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Take care, associates. Hive-quakes have destabilised this place."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","I find servitors rather reassuring. They're quietly dependable."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","Isn't it reassuring to know that after death, one's service may continue?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","Here's the cargo elevator. Proceed, associates!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","We're clear to enter the cargo elevator."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","This place is a tactical nightmare. And I sense, a literal one too..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","This maze is full of the stench of fear..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_approach_01","Chasm Terminus ahead."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_approach_02","This can't be the most discreet approach to the station?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","If we can't deliver justice, no one else can. We fight for Atoma."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","Try to remember protocol, but mostly, please try to stay alive."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_01","We shall do our duty."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Atoma requires us to succeed. We won't fail her."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Did we miss a briefing on this target?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","We surely need further intel on the target we're about to engage."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","This is strategically unsound!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","This is tactically sub-optimal!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","This looks familiar."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","Blunt instruments...  literally. Not as sophisticated as myself and my siblings."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Is this the most efficient approach?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Are these trains really so stragetically crucial?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","I admire your professionalism, but I wonder what you really think."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Useful advice, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","This covert approach isn't what I'm used to."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Enforcers are used to being visible. This feels like sneaking."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","I acknowledge, we have no choice."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Whatever it takes to free Tertium."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","I don't like this place. Feels strategically unsound."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Is this the most tactical location for the splice?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Understood."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Seems logical."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","These soldiers have numbers... but enthusiasm?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","We could have been sent livelier reinforcements..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_station_hall_01","They have bespoiled one of Tertium's jewels."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_station_hall_02","Would that you had seen this place as it was meant to be..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Look associates, fire in the south."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_station_the_bridge_02","The fight spreads. See the fire to the south?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","You'd expect the criminal life to be rather more comfortable..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Atoma's cells are more luxurious than this..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","The daemon is aware of us, associates.  Maintain caution."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","The daemon burns at the edges of my mind..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Then perhaps Tertium stands a chance yet..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Perhaps it has a weakness we can exploit. We must hope so..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","It would be strategically inadvisable to leave the heretics here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","We can't leave the Torrent to the heretics."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","I doubt the strategic value of that approach."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","I'm not convinced you think that's the best course of action..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","What could the enforcers do about the Torrent? There's a question...."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Tertium may not care about the Torrent, but the Torrent's still part of Tertium..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","True enough."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Always the same patterns, wherever you go."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","Nice, isn't it? The locals take great pride in maintaining the statue."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","A little grand for my taste, but the citizens round here are very proud of it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","No access here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","We'll need to find another entry point."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","Mind your footing. This place is due some maintenence."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Standard acid damage. Don't make a fuss, just watch where you walk."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Remarkable infrastructure, isn't it?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","The statistics on this place's contribution to Atoman water supplies are fascinating. Really!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","Quickly, Associates. The Atmospheric shield doesn't look well maintained."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","We don't want to be up here when the Atmospheric Shield fails. And I suspect it's when, not if."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_crossroads_01","If this were a professional outfit, we'd have been given a map."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_crossroads_02","A proper briefing would have included a map..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","[Grunt of discomfort] Associates, I can feel the daemon."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","[Grunt of discomfort] The daemon is aware of us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","Nothing here. Keep going!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","Move on. These are dry."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","I do not care for the strategic situation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","This seems strategically unsound."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I don't think this elevator's been properly maintained."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I don't like that rattle. hold tight."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","I'm sure it's more reliable than it looks."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","It's designed to be robust. Although maintenance probably is important..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","I'd relish the opportunity."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","The optimal approach, I agree. But we'll need bigger guns."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","A daemon ... Will there be more?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Is that the only daemon? Is it vanquished for good?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","So you don't know. Or won't say?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Ah. What a day. What a day."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","I hope anti-infection protocols are in place for our squad?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","Please confirm precautions have been taken to prevent us getting infected?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","That is somewhat reassuring."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","It's better than no plan."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","Do we have further intel on the pathogen?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Can you brief us on this pathogen?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Let me guess. There's no protocol for that..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","An untested hazard. Most irksome."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","This decay is a sorry sight."
"loc_psyker_male_c__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","Would that this place had been better maintained"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_01","Look out!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_02","I advise you move!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_03","Watch out!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_04","Expedite yourself!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_05","Emperor's Teeth!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_06","You must move!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_07","Fall back!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_08","Get away!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_09","It's going to strike!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_combo_attack_10","It's attacking!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_01","Ready your weapons!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_02","Combat protocol, colleagues."
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_03","Prepare for duty!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_04","Deploy weapons!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_05","Prepare for combat!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_06","This needs neutralising."
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_07","Please remember combat protocol."
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_08","Ready weapons, colleagues."
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_09","Colleagues, ready yourselves."
"loc_psyker_male_c__monster_fight_start_reaction_10","Prepare to administer justice."
"loc_psyker_male_c__need_rescue_01","Associates! I would be indebted for aid!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__need_rescue_02","I am in need of rescue! Hurry!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__need_rescue_03","Retrieval requested! With all haste!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__need_rescue_04","Requesting retrieval! I would be an asset!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__need_rescue_05","No enforcer would ever leave a colleague behind!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_01","The heretics have harnessed powers beyond what I thought possible."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_a_02","The heretics' tactics are most unconventional. They should not work."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_01","A closed mind is secure, but it is seldom safe."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_five_c_02","Ignorance is thought a shield, but it is really a box."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_01","Our situation is not encouraging, associates."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_a_02","No matter how hard we fight, our fortunes worsen."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_01","It was an honest assessment. Truth has value."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_four_c_02","If we are to trade in denial we are already lost."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","Our foes have curious and blasphemous obsessions."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","The goals of our foes may be clear. Their methods are ... strange."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","There is no understanding such a mindset."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","The logic escapes me ... but perhaps that is for the best."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","With every step I sense a presence ... It has a name. ""Nurgle""."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_02","The word ""Nurgle"" is ever in the heretics' thoughts ... even if they don't know what it means."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_01","Surely it is better to know our enemy?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_c_02","Knowledge is a shield. At least in most cases."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_01","I fear salvation of this place may be beyond us."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_a_02","From what I have seen, there is little hope of restoring this zone."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_01","If such is our duty, so I will strive."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_two_c_02","You are correct of course. Forgive me."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_01","I don't think any of this belongs here ..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_02","What horror is now visited upon Atoma?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_03","The walls of reality are weak here."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_04","This is not a pleasant experience."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_05","I fear these growths portend something terrible."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_06","This is only the start of the infestation. Unchecked, it will spread."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_07","This is the future of Atoma, should we fail."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_08","This place has the stink of the Immaterium."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_09","Corruption all around. This is a bitter day."
"loc_psyker_male_c__nurgle_circumstance_prop_growth_a_10","These growths are nothing natural. I fear what may yet emerge."

"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_05","Yes, yes, yes. We're all well aware!"
"loc_psyker_female_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_06","You just HAVE to be the center of attention, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_02_b_01","My Beloved says that's very inspiring. Though not entirely true."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_05_b_01","Yes, I think that's probably true. We never get a moment's peace."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_11_b_01","My Beloved says I don't have to if I don't want to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_15_b_01","That doesn't sound very nice, even if you are a figment of my dream."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_18_b_01","Oh, I don't know. I'm enjoying myself ... I think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_20_b_01","Excuse me? I think you might have had one blow to the head too many."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_02_b_01","Yes, they're very unruly. And untidy. No wonder my dream's such a state."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_05_b_01","Oh, that is nice ... The first part, not the ""and therefore you're going to die"" bit."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_11_b_01","I always keep my eyes open. It's how I don't walk into things."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_15_b_01","I've definitely seen worse ... but I don't like to talk about those."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_18_b_01","Oh how nice! ... At least, I think that's nice."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_20_b_01","Don't you dare. I quite like it here."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_02_b_01","I think that if I stand really, REALLY still the heretics might not notice me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_04_b_01","Well, nobody told me! ... Oh, maybe they did. It's so hard to keep track."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_10_b_01","That sounds ever so tiring, don't you think so, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_14_b_01","Yes, Beloved. I think somebody needs a hug."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_17_b_01","My Beloved says that's only true up to a point ... which I don't think is very helpful, if I'm honest."
"loc_psyker_female_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_19_b_01","Really? Well, things are looking up after all. I think."
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_01","Oppressor? Ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_02","There's Ammunition here, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_03","My Beloved says you need this ammunition, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_04","This ammunition might be useful, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_01","Yes, Beloved. The Oppressor should use this medicae."
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_02","Do you want this medicae, Oppressor?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_03","You should mend those wounds Oppressor. No one's impressed!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_04","You're wounded, Oppressor. The medicae will help!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_01","You shot me, Oppressor! That's not very nice!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_02","Why did you shoot me, Oppressor?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_03","The Oppressor shot me! I'm very angry now."
"loc_psyker_female_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_04","Beloved? Make the Oppressor stop shooting me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_05","I'm on your side, Oppressor. But not if you keep doing that!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_06","The Arbitrator shot me! And it wasn't an accident!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_01","You do keep falling over, Oppressor. Are you drunk?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_02","Do stop falling down. Oppressor. You're embarrassing me."
"loc_psyker_female_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_03","My Beloved says you need to dodge more, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_04","My Beloved wonders if you should try blocking. So do I."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_adamant_01","The Oppressor's dead? How did that happen?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_adamant_02","The Oppressor's dead, but it's not all bad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_adamant_03","I suppose it's a shame the Oppressor's dead."
"loc_psyker_female_b__player_death_adamant_04","There's one less Oppressor on Atoma. Is that good or bad?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_01","So much blood! The Oppressor really is good at this."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_02","You DO have a talent for carnage, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_03","Yes, Beloved. I'm glad the Oppressor's on our side. What? No, you don't mean that ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_04","Arbitrators are very good at killing. But then, I knew that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_01","Oh do get up. This is very boring."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_02","You shouldn't be down there, you know."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_03","Whatever is the matter with you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_04","I think you just want attention."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_05","No, Beloved, I'm not going to leave them down there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_06","Easy ... Easy ... I've got you."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_01","Can anyone cover them?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_02","I think they need supporting fire!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_03","Is anyone going to help?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_04","Someone cover the Oppressor! They sound unhappy!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_01","Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_02","Yes Beloved, I think they're going to die. Oh well."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_03","Yes! I dreamed up a terrible fate, just for you!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_04","Oh dear. That looks fatal to me. Never mind."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Oh, that Hound's going to be trouble."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Bad dog! Leave them alone!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Well, you did just stare at it when it pounced!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","I thought you were good with animals!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_01","Oh, someone's bound to help."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_02","Yes, Beloved, that is an unenviable position."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_03","I really don't know what to say about that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_04","I'll help you. At least, I'd like to ... I think I'd like to."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_05","Are we helping the Oppressor? "
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_06","We ARE helping the Oppressor, yes?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_01","That was VERY impressive, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_02","Yes, Beloved, that WAS a very impressive kill."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_03","I do like your technique, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_04","I've killed bigger, Oppressor. Not that it's a competition."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_01","Oh really."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_02","And you say that I'M the Liability."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_03","You always have to make a fuss, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_04","You're SO impatient. It's annoying."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_01","That looks precarious."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_02","I don't think you want to be there."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_03","It's a very long way down."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_04","If it helps, I don't think you'll feel it when you hit bottom."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_05","No, Beloved. That isn't a good place to ""hang out""."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_06","You can't fool me. You just want attention."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","I've always been this good. I just don't like showing off."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_02","You've made me all self-conscious."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_03","Just remember not upset me. You wouldn't like that."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_04","I know! I am very good at all this!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_01","How kind ... I think ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_02","I thought ... you'd leave me ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_03","Please be ... gentle ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_04","But I WANT ... to have a nice lie down ..."
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_01","Sorry! These things happen!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_02","My Beloved says it wasn't me!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_03","Sorry! It's instinct to shoot at your sort!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_04","I'm not going to apologise. I'm not!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_01","We'd better do something about that!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_02","What a lot of noise. Is it serious?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_03","I'm sure we can help! But do we want to?"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_04","I'm sure help is on its way!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_05","That Arbitrator's in trouble!"
"loc_psyker_female_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_06","Try not to die! That's my advice!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_02_b_01","Dedication to duty is a most admirable trait."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_05_b_01","You are correct to be cautious. I shall remain vigilant."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_11_b_01","A fine calling ... so long as we remain focused on what truly matters."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_15_b_01","Things will improve. We need only serve and survive. "
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_18_b_01","Expect little and you will surely not be disappointed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_20_b_01","A simple truth. But then, the simple truths are often the best."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_02_b_01","Indeed. But justice should be applied fairly, or else it is not justice at all."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_05_b_01","I have committed no crime save empathy. Though that is surely enough to see me condemned."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_11_b_01","Sound advice. I will report all sightings."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_15_b_01","It is ours to improve, if we strive for it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_18_b_01","I hope to be worthy of your supervision, and not your suspicion."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_20_b_01","And how many innocents would pay the price?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_02_b_01","Yet preparation is all. A hasty action is sometimes a rash one."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_06_b_01","A cruel measure perhaps, but necessary in our current situation."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_10_b_01","But that fury must be tempered, associate, lest it consumes us also."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_14_b_01","Regretfully, I suppose that is pragmatic."
"loc_psyker_female_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_18_b_01","I shall certainly strive for the latter. The former ... raises questions."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_01","Ammo resupply here, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_02","Oppressor, resupply and reload."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_03","Ammo here, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_04","Take this ammo, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_01","Healing here, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_02","Take these meds, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_03","Need meds? You are bleeding more than protocol recommends."
"loc_psyker_female_c__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_04","You'll need meds to continue fighting, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_01","You hit me, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_02","Aah! Was that intentional, Oppressor?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_03","I am not the enemy, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_04","Mind your weapons, Arbitrator!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_05","Take care, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_06","Aah! Target the enemy, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_01","I recommend staying vertical, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_02","So, they didn't teach basic locomotion at the Scholam?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_03","It must be hard to oppress and walk at the same time."
"loc_psyker_female_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_04","This is most unprofessional."
"loc_psyker_female_c__player_death_adamant_01","Your service is acknowledged, Arbitrator!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__player_death_adamant_02","The Arbitrator has been eliminated."
"loc_psyker_female_c__player_death_adamant_03","Your watch is ended, Arbitrator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__player_death_adamant_04","The Arbitrator has returned to Him on Terra."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_01","Admirable form, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_02","Now I see the value of your training, Arbitrator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_03","A satisfactory contribution, Arbitrator."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_04","Efficient work, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_start_revive_adamant_01","You require assistance."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_start_revive_adamant_02","Allow me to aid you."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_start_revive_adamant_03","Let me help, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_start_revive_adamant_04","I offer aid, if you will accept it."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_start_revive_adamant_05","Even you will not be left behind, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__psyker_start_revive_adamant_06","An Associate is an Associate. Let me help."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_01","The Oppressor requires aid!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_02","The Arbitrator needs backup!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_03","Consider extricating yourself, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_cover_me_04","Your Associates will aid when they can, Arbitrator!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_01","Medicae for you, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_02","And I thought the Scholam taught resilience..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_03","The solution is to tend your wounds. Not complain."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_04","Didn't your Arbitrator training cover Medicae? Unfortunate."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","You want to get that beast off, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Less than ideal."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","That beast is as stubborn as you, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","The Oppressor looks rather hounded..."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_01","Arbitrator down!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_02","Associates, aid the Arbitrator!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_03","Arbitrator requires backup!"

"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_06","Hold fast, Arbitrator!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_01","Masterfully deployed."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_02","Your Scholam training shows its value, Arbitrator!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_03","Skillfully done."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_04","Most effective!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_01","Arbitrator down!"

"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_03","We hear you, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_04","Someone help the Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_01","The Arbitrator requires aid!"

"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_04","The Arbitrator needs assistance!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_05","Stand by, Arbitrator!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_06","Aid is incoming, Oppressor!"

"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_03","Did the Scholam not teach formation?"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_04","An error on my part, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_01","Assistance incoming!"
"loc_psyker_female_c__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_02","Aid is on the way!"

"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_05_b_01","What it is to be popular ... I miss feeling lonely."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_08_b_01","It sounds very dull. But some of us thrive on tedium."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_09_b_01","All except us Psykers of course, who will always live and die alone."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_15_b_01","Yes, yes, yes. I have every sympathy, I'm sure."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_19_b_01","Then he has a remarkable way of showing it."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_01_b_01","A fascinating philosophical problem. Be sure that the answer will be ""just kill them anyway""."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_04_b_01","Personally I try not to breathe too deeply around here."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_08_b_01","One may not be enough ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_15_b_01","You must be new at this if you're expecting glory in ANY form."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_19_b_01","Do I hear another pointless endeavour calling me?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_01_b_01","I would quibble ... but then again they ARE trying to kill me ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_03_b_01","Such a narrow view of the world. Does it give you a headache? "
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_07_b_01","Oh good. Another one with an imaginary friend to take the blame for everything."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_08_b_01","Somehow I knew you were going to say that."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_14_b_01","Yes, that's the nuanced approach I've come to expect."
"loc_psyker_male_a__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_18_b_01","Anything else you'd like to add to your list?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_01","Oppressor? There is ammunition here!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_02","Do you need ammunition, Oppressor?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_03","You may have this ammunition only if you do not use it on me, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_04","Arbitrator! Take this ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_01","There is medicae here, Oppressor!"

"loc_psyker_male_a__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_03","Arbitrator? You should really use these meds."
"loc_psyker_male_a__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_04","Meds here, Arbitrator! You should probabl use them."
"loc_psyker_male_a__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_01","Such a delicate flower."
"loc_psyker_male_a__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_02","You are a brittle soul, Oppressor."

"loc_psyker_male_a__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_04","This is no time to take a soothing nap, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_adamant_01","Well, at least it will be a little quieter now."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_adamant_02","The Arbitrator's dead! Does anyone care?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_adamant_03","One less Oppressor to cower from."
"loc_psyker_male_a__player_death_adamant_04","The Oppressor's dead. What a terrible, terrible shame."
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_01","You ARE a bloodthirsty soul, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_02","I knew it! The Oppressor's a maniac!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_03","So you CAN kill people who are fighting back, Oppressor?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_04","See the Oppressor go! I suppose it's a LITTLE impressive."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_cover_me_01","The Oppressor wants covering fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_cover_me_02","Someone cover the Oppressor? If only to stop the complaints!"

"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","One slobbering brute chewing on another. Nature is beautiful."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","The Oppressor has made a friend!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","I think that might be a family reunion!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_01","Yes, yes, yes. We'll get to you."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_02","Is someone going to do something about that?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_03","It seems the Oppressor needs help!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_04","The Oppressor needs help!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_05","Careless, Oppressor. Very careless!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_06","Didn't see that coming, did you?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_01","One monstrosity downs another. Sheer poetry."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_02","I suppose that was somewhat impressive."

"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_04","Now you're just showing off, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_01","Have patience! It's horrible around here!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_02","You're not the only one with troubles!"

"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_03","I do hope you don't slip."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_04","Is someone going to pull them up?"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_05","It's probably best that you don't let go."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_06","Are you slipping? I think you're slipping."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","Yes, I'm very impressive! Everyone knows that!"

"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_02","Are you sure it was me? It's very anarchic hereabouts!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_03","You can't prove it. Story of your life, I suspect!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_04","False accusations, is it? I'm not surprised!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_01","I SUPPOSE someone ought to help ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_02","If only you had some friends nearby ..."
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_03","Screaming about it won't help you!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_04","I know, I know. Stop distracting me!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_05","Yes, yes, yes. We're all well aware!"
"loc_psyker_male_a__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_06","You just HAVE to be the center of attention, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_02_b_01","My Beloved says that's very inspiring. Though not entirely true."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_05_b_01","Yes, I think that's probably true. We never get a moment's peace."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_11_b_01","My Beloved says I don't have to if I don't want to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_15_b_01","That doesn't sound very nice, even if you are a figment of my dream."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_18_b_01","Oh, I don't know. I'm enjoying myself ... I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_20_b_01","Excuse me? I think you might have had one blow to the head too many."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_02_b_01","Yes, they're very unruly. And untidy. No wonder my dream's such a state."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_05_b_01","Oh, that is nice ... The first part, not the ""and therefore you're going to die"" bit."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_11_b_01","I always keep my eyes open. It's how I don't walk into things."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_15_b_01","I've definitely seen worse ... but I don't like to talk about those."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_18_b_01","Oh how nice! ... At least, I think that's nice."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_20_b_01","Don't you dare. I quite like it here."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_02_b_01","I think that if I stand really, REALLY still the heretics might not notice me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_04_b_01","Well, nobody told me! ... Oh, maybe they did. It's so hard to keep track."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_10_b_01","That sounds ever so tiring, don't you think so, Beloved?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_14_b_01","Yes, Beloved. I think somebody needs a hug."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_17_b_01","My Beloved says that's only true up to a point ... which I don't think is very helpful, if I'm honest."
"loc_psyker_male_b__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_19_b_01","Really? Well, things are looking up after all. I think."
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_01","Oppressor? Ammunition!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_02","There's Ammunition here, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_03","My Beloved says you need this ammunition, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_04","This ammunition might be useful, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_01","Yes, Beloved. The Oppressor should use this medicae."
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_02","Do you want this medicae, Oppressor?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_03","You should mend those wounds Oppressor. No one's impressed!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_04","You're wounded, Oppressor. The medicae will help!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_01","You shot me, Oppressor! That's not very nice!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_02","Why did you shoot me, Oppressor?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_03","The Oppressor shot me! I'm very angry now."
"loc_psyker_male_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_04","Beloved? Make the Oppressor stop shooting me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_05","I'm on your side, Oppressor. But not if you keep doing that!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_06","The Arbitrator shot me! And it wasn't an accident!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_01","You do keep falling over, Oppressor. Are you drunk?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_02","Do stop falling down. Oppressor. You're embarrassing me."
"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_03","My Beloved says you need to dodge more, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_male_b__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_04","My Beloved wonders if you should try blocking. So do I."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_adamant_01","The Oppressor's dead? How did that happen?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_adamant_02","The Oppressor's dead, but it's not all bad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_adamant_03","I suppose it's a shame the Oppressor's dead."
"loc_psyker_male_b__player_death_adamant_04","There's one less Oppressor on Atoma. Is that good or bad?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_01","So much blood! The Oppressor really is good at this."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_02","You DO have a talent for carnage, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_03","Yes, Beloved. I'm glad the Oppressor's on our side. What? No, you don't mean that ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_seen_killstreak_adamant_04","Arbitrators are very good at killing. But then, I knew that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_01","Oh do get up. This is very boring."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_02","You shouldn't be down there, you know."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_03","Whatever is the matter with you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_04","I think you just want attention."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_05","No, Beloved, I'm not going to leave them down there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__psyker_start_revive_adamant_06","Easy ... Easy ... I've got you."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_01","Can anyone cover them?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_02","I think they need supporting fire!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_03","Is anyone going to help?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_cover_me_04","Someone cover the Oppressor! They sound unhappy!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_01","Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_02","Yes Beloved, I think they're going to die. Oh well."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_03","Yes! I dreamed up a terrible fate, just for you!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_critical_health_04","Oh dear. That looks fatal to me. Never mind."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Oh, that Hound's going to be trouble."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Bad dog! Leave them alone!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Well, you did just stare at it when it pounced!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","I thought you were good with animals!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_01","Oh, someone's bound to help."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_02","Yes, Beloved, that is an unenviable position."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_03","I really don't know what to say about that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_04","I'll help you. At least, I'd like to ... I think I'd like to."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_05","Are we helping the Oppressor? "
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_enemy_06","We ARE helping the Oppressor, yes?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_01","That was VERY impressive, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_02","Yes, Beloved, that WAS a very impressive kill."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_03","I do like your technique, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_enemy_kill_monster_04","I've killed bigger, Oppressor. Not that it's a competition."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_01","Oh really."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_02","And you say that I'M the Liability."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_03","You always have to make a fuss, don't you?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_knocked_down_3_04","You're SO impatient. It's annoying."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_01","That looks precarious."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_02","I don't think you want to be there."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_03","It's a very long way down."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_04","If it helps, I don't think you'll feel it when you hit bottom."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_05","No, Beloved. That isn't a good place to ""hang out""."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_ledge_hanging_06","You can't fool me. You just want attention."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_01","I've always been this good. I just don't like showing off."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_02","You've made me all self-conscious."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_03","Just remember not upset me. You wouldn't like that."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_seen_killstreak_psyker_04","I know! I am very good at all this!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_01","How kind ... I think ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_02","I thought ... you'd leave me ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_03","Please be ... gentle ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_adamant_start_revive_psyker_04","But I WANT ... to have a nice lie down ..."
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_01","Sorry! These things happen!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_02","My Beloved says it wasn't me!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_03","Sorry! It's instinct to shoot at your sort!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_friendly_fire_from_psyker_to_adamant_04","I'm not going to apologise. I'm not!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_01","We'd better do something about that!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_02","What a lot of noise. Is it serious?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_03","I'm sure we can help! But do we want to?"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_04","I'm sure help is on its way!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_05","That Arbitrator's in trouble!"
"loc_psyker_male_b__response_for_pinned_by_enemies_adamant_06","Try not to die! That's my advice!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_02_b_01","Dedication to duty is a most admirable trait."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_05_b_01","You are correct to be cautious. I shall remain vigilant."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_11_b_01","A fine calling ... so long as we remain focused on what truly matters."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_15_b_01","Things will improve. We need only serve and survive. "
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_18_b_01","Expect little and you will surely not be disappointed."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_a_20_b_01","A simple truth. But then, the simple truths are often the best."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_02_b_01","Indeed. But justice should be applied fairly, or else it is not justice at all."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_05_b_01","I have committed no crime save empathy. Though that is surely enough to see me condemned."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_11_b_01","Sound advice. I will report all sightings."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_15_b_01","It is ours to improve, if we strive for it."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_18_b_01","I hope to be worthy of your supervision, and not your suspicion."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_b_20_b_01","And how many innocents would pay the price?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_02_b_01","Yet preparation is all. A hasty action is sometimes a rash one."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_06_b_01","A cruel measure perhaps, but necessary in our current situation."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_10_b_01","But that fury must be tempered, associate, lest it consumes us also."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_14_b_01","Regretfully, I suppose that is pragmatic."
"loc_psyker_male_c__combat_pause_limited_adamant_c_18_b_01","I shall certainly strive for the latter. The former ... raises questions."
"loc_psyker_male_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_01","Ammo resupply here, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_male_c__found_ammo_adamant_low_on_ammo_02","Oppressor, resupply and reload."

"loc_psyker_male_c__found_health_booster_adamant_low_on_health_04","You'll need meds to continue fighting, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_01","You hit me, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__friendly_fire_from_adamant_to_psyker_02","Aah! Was that intentional, Oppressor?"

"loc_psyker_male_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_02","So, they didn't teach basic locomotion at the Scholam?"
"loc_psyker_male_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_03","It must be hard to oppress and walk at the same time."
"loc_psyker_male_c__knocked_down_multiple_times_adamant_04","This is most unprofessional."
"loc_psyker_male_c__player_death_adamant_01","Your service is acknowledged, Arbitrator!"

"loc_psyker_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_01","Medicae for you, Oppressor."
"loc_psyker_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_02","And I thought the Scholam taught resilience..."
"loc_psyker_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_03","The solution is to tend your wounds. Not complain."
"loc_psyker_male_c__response_for_adamant_critical_health_04","Didn't your Arbitrator training cover Medicae? Unfortunate."
"loc_psyker_male_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","You want to get that beast off, Oppressor!"
"loc_psyker_male_c__response_for_adamant_disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Less than ideal."
