"loc_zealot_female_a__asset_sigil_02","Sad that such a noble office as a consulate has fallen upon hard times."
"loc_zealot_female_a__asset_unnatural_dark_a_01","Dark as the blackest pit ahead."
"loc_zealot_female_a__asset_unnatural_dark_a_02","These slovenly wretches hath not maintained the lights..."

"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_c_zea_a_c_01","Twas a shame about Cadia. Still ... I'm sure the world wouldst not hath fallen had its warriors been truly faithful."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_killstreak_extension_vet_a_zea_a_d_01","So long as thou art true to the Emperor, I shalt stand with thee."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_language_b_01","Whatever dost thou mean?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_language_d_01","I … Well … Perhaps I do indulge one or two choice epithets. I find them calming."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_language_f_01","Well … Perhaps another time."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aiming_b_01","How dare thee! The Master guideth my shots... but perhaps, this mortal flesh is not so receptive to divine inspiration as I might wish."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aiming_d_01","Very well. I see little harm in such an endeavour ... My thanks."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_air_sick_a_01","I hope we art not to suffereth on the return flight as we didst on the journey down from the Mourningstar, Slab?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_air_sick_c_01","Nor had the rest of us any idea until that most disagreeable moment. And that smell! I didst not believe such a thing was possible."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_air_sick_e_01","Indeed ... and for that small act of charity I am duly grateful."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_art_b_01","Yes, I too feel a yearning to gazeth upon the works of Finris Corvalla. It is said none captured the likeness of Saint Messelina more completely."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_art_d_01","We should speak with Sister Zola. She, I deem, will understand."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_callous_b_01","I hath faced ... vexing times, tis true. To count thyself among the faithful in this wicked world is to carry a great burden."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_callous_d_01","And finding one who can be trusted to share those burdens the search of a lifetime."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_callous_e_01","Yes. So I must hope."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_challenges_b_01","Verily! Righteous soul or vile heretic, naught escapes his sight."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_challenges_d_01","Because he fears thy faith is lacking. He sets ... challenges in thy path."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_challenges_f_01","Good, Templar. You may yet know his favour after all."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_comrades_b_01","Ah, but to haveth both is finest still, is it not?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_comrades_d_01","You needst not fear, good Templar. Thou art never far from the Master's thoughts, and I shalt ever be at thy side."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_b_01","A worthy goal, though I feareth not one easily accomplished. Where there art enforcers, there corruption thrives."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_d_01","My apologies, I meant no offence. Thou art clearly of a different calibre."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubts_b_01","Betimes, Slab. In moments of doubt. Not that I am afflicted often, thou understandeth?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubts_d_01","Yes. Yes, of course he doth. Clearly, and with precision. My observances are a seam of gold amid the dross. He wouldst never forsake me. Never!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubts_f_01","I am ... [with mild desperation]. I am."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_emprah_a_01","Dost thou worship the Master, Slab? "
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_emprah_c_01","Indeed, his is the might of ages, wielded against the undeserving. And in you, I see his strong right hand."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_emprah_e_01","I am sure. If only thou hadst wit to match. Alas."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_b_01","Faith provides when the body fails. I didst this very morning perform a blessed ritual, begging the Master to lend me strength."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_d_01","I feeleth that my labours doth speak for themselves."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_energy_f_01","Indeed. "
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_faith_b_01","Verily! Though I was brought to Atoma against my will, I see now that the Master of Mankind's hand was ever on my shoulder."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_faith_d_01","Indeed. It falleth to us to repay that debt in blood. Ours ... or preferably that of the heretics."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fingers_a_01","Many times, Slab, I hath seen thee counting upon thy fingers in the Valkyrie. Why dost thou do this?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fingers_c_01","Wouldst you truly not know otherwise?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_forgiveness_a_01","There can be no forgiveness for the heretics. By his actions, a betrayer forsaketh all entitlement to mercy."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_forgiveness_c_01","I wilt have thee know that I am a bastion of tolerance. Tis merely our cirumstances that rouseth me to intemperance. Certainty is a mocker of restraint."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fury_a_01","I have been watching thee, Templar. Thou are truly becoming an implement of divine fury."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fury_c_01","But who guideth thy aim? Who giveth thee the strength to prevail?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fury_e_01","Ah ... self-awareness. Tis satisfying to behold."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_heretics_b_01","Yes! Let us not tarry. We shalt slay them together!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_heretics_d_01","Ah, but thou art my abomination. Tis different."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hungry_b_01","Again? Slab, thou really must learn to ... well ... ration your rations."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_hungry_d_01","[Sigh] I suppose charity demands I should shareth some of mine, but I must have thy promise that thou will not gobble it all in one go."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leave_a_01","Wouldst thou believe that some of our ... colleagues ... art petitioning for leave?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leave_c_01","Indeed! Tis my hope that Morrow takes a most dim view ... but mayhap it is for the best that such lollygaggers are rooted out."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_leave_e_01","Never fear! I shall ever standeth alongside thee."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindfulness_a_01","Keep the Master ever in thy thoughts, and there may yet be some hope for thy immortal soul."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindfulness_c_01","Not so. As a righteous soul it falleth to me to balance the brief joy of extinguishing thy abominable presence with the possibility of the good that thou might yet achieve."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mindfulness_e_01","It tendeth more one way than the other. But feareth not! Thou shalt be the very first to know."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_modicum_a_01","[Liturgical Humming]"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_modicum_c_01","I am? Well, there is little to stirreth the spirit more readily than a modicum of righteous slaughter."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_modicum_e_01","Yes. And their numbers showeth no prospect of abating. "
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_precision_b_01","Dost thou believeth so? In my experience, precision is the foundation of predictability."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_precision_d_01","Thou art not the first to maketh that suggestion. I can only conclude that thou hath been conspiring with the others."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_protector_b_01","Oh ... And what hath I done to deserveth such largesse?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_protector_d_01","Alas no, Slab. Although I thank thee for what thou surely meant as a compliment."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_punishment_b_01","Mercy only encourages the blasphemer, the heretic, the--"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_punishment_d_01","""The witch"" is what I meant to say. Not all psykers art witches, though of course all witches art psykers."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_punishment_f_01","That remaineth to be seen ... but I hath my hopes."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reading_b_01","Thou cannot? Truly? Was not thy bone 'ead implant intended to raise thee to the point of learning such skills?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reading_d_01","[Sigh] Oh, very well. Shouldst we survive this mission, then I might - might, mark thou - offer thee my humble assistance ... may the Master grant me patience."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_restoration_a_01","Atoma may be wretched in this hour, but our labours shalt surely see her restored, good Templar."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_restoration_c_01","Indeed, woe to him that is deaf to the Master's call. Death to he who rejects it out of craven cowardice."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_restoration_e_01","Oh ... Well ... If that is thy wish ... My thanks."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reverence_b_01","Only those of us who hath proved themselves worthy."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_reverence_d_01","To hear a Freak speak thus ... It is not unpleasant."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rigor_b_01","I act as I do only out of need. I yearn for the day when I might set aside the bolter and chainsword in favour of quill and parchment."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_rigor_d_01","Alas yes. But it draws closer each time the bolter roars."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_salvation_b_01","That is the very core of Ecclesiarchal creed, Slab ... provided that what we are told to do is purgeth heretics in all their blasphemous forms."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_salvation_d_01","Why, we continue to purgeth heretics as proof of our righteousness, of course. "
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_too_small_for_doubt_a_01","I admire thee, Slab. Blessed is the mind too small for doubt, and thy mind is perhaps one of the smallest."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_too_small_for_doubt_c_01","Dost thou question one of the Master's parables?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wounds_a_01","I see that thou art favouring thy right leg. Art thou wounded?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wounds_c_01","Then I shall pray to the Master of Mankind to bring thee relief. Pain is worthless save for when it doth bring clarity."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_reclaimed_b_01","Yes! Yes! In this I can agree with thee! Let the heretics be cast out and the Master’s will be done."
"loc_zealot_female_a__bonding_conversation_reclaimed_d_01","Well … Yes, if the opportunity presents itself."
"loc_zealot_female_a__calling_for_help_01","Help!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","She is true to the Master of Mankind. What else matters?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She appears to be a righteous soul, but so do many hidden heretics."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","So long as she serveth the Throne, I hath no quarrel."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","One may be loyal to the Throne, and not one's companions ... as I'm sure you knoweth."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Werest thou aware that Explicator Zola was born on Atoma?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","I'm not one to gossip, but I heard the explicator once lived on Atoma."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","And since when did the past matter more than the present?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Scandalous, I am certain ... No, wait. This is entirely trivial."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_01","It transpires our pilot is more devout than I believed."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_02","Our pilot is not the apostate I feared."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_03","Our pilot is surprisingly devout."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_04","Would you believe our pilot can actually be counted among the faithful?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Truly? I find that somewhat hard to entertain."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Praise the Master of Mankind! ... Thou art ... certain?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_01","I assure you, no one is more surprised than I. She showed me a finger bone from Saint Sibelia!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_02","Such a revelation in this dark hour. Why, she gifted me a holy text penned by Redemptor Kyrinov himself!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_03","She discovered a blessed Fleur de Lys in the ruins of Carpenthia, and she found herself filled with faith!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_04","She even gifted me her most precious possession - a scrap of leather from Confessor Prenorious' Tome of Penance!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","How splendid. Tis enough to restore one's faith in base soldiery."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","These are such welcome tidings. A good omen for the future."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","Our pilot should show more respect."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I fear our pilot is not the pillar of faith these times require."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","She will find her punishment, if need be. As do all those who are lacking in ... ardour."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","Cleansing fire will find her, should she stray ... or prove unreliable."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Her afflictions are not my concern ... until they veer into heresy."

"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","Then she is to be commended. Brunt has no manners. Like all Catachans."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Impressive. He is somewhat ... formidable."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","And why dost thou look so miserable this fine night?"

"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","He should not mourn the fallen. Either they were faithful and died in glory, or feckless and met a deserved end."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","The Master of Mankind will guide Morrow, as he does us all."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","He will find peace, so long as he does the Emperor's will."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","I do not care for the sergeant's attitude. I fear his faith is lacking alongside his civility."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","The sergeant's manner vexes me. Why, he often seems little better than the dregs we contest."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Times such as these place pressures even on the devout ... perhaps it is a sign of Morrow's weakness?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","It may be Morrow is not the man to be holding our leash."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","He should seek solace in the Emperor's Light."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","The Master of Mankind will give him comfort, if he seeks it."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Thou should pretend I have no idea of what thou sayeth. For I do not."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","I do not concern myself with petty military actions."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","Genestealers? A plague upon the Imperium! Dost thou suppose Morrow was in the Inquisitor's service even then?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","And Morrow was there as the Inquisitor's operative?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","One of the lexmechanics claims Morrow fought in the Second War for Armageddon. He cannot be so old."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow cannot have been at Hades Hive as some claim. He is too young."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Perhaps we witness the sustaining power of faith?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Faith can sustain a body. Such is the Emperor's gift, if he so chooses."

"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","The Tech-Priest ... is not what I expected, I admit."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","I wonder if there remains any true human soul in that body of hers."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","Worship of the Omnissiah remaineth homage to the Master. I am content."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","Truly, I see little reason for concern. We all serveth the same cause."
"loc_zealot_female_a__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Faith often-times chooseth strange vessels."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","An Enforcer who faileth to punish such wickedness is as guilty as the perpetrator."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Violators of the Master's law must be punished… Chaos thrives when lawless deeds go unchecked!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","There are some who wouldst decry the Hive as a suitable dwelling-place. But is not Holy Terra a Hive World?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Hive worlds are modelled upon Holy Terra itself, whose gleaming spires provide inspiration for us all!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_a_02","The blessed metalfabs of Atoma are highly prized. We just protect them in the Master's name!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_a_03","Doth not the scale of Tertium's industry fill thee with pride in human endeavour?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_a_04","The manufactorums of Hive Tertium hath long been a shining beacon of Imperial industry, now dimmed by heretical incursions."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Tis vital the secret of Moebian steel doth not fall into enemy hands."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","The steel produced in these manufactorums doth clad the blessed tanks of the Astra Militarum. It's import cannot be overstated."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_imperium_four_b_02","The Bell of Lost Souls tolleth not for a slab such as thee!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_imperium_four_c_01","Tis just as well. Pride cometh before a sharp descent."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_imperium_three_c_01","In return for their fealty, a Governor may rule as they please. Testament to the Master's benevolence."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_imperium_three_c_02","There is no finer test of loyalty. A governor who cannot meet Terra's Due lacks both faith and strength."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","The Inquisition commandeth not the Officio Assassinorum. They are the Knives of the Master."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","They art the bloody-handed saviours of the Imperium, and their work proceedeth beyond even the Inquisition's gaze."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","Tis a privilege that should be enjoyed by the righteous, not bestowed on some... freak!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Judgement of the heretical is the burden of the pious. Something you wouldst know little about!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","Even lawmakers are not beyond impure thought. That is why we must be on hand to judge them!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","It falleth to us to uphold the Lex Imperialis, and to do so we must be beyond reproach in thought and deed!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_a_01","Tis the greatest honour of all to join the Ordo Hereticus. Dost thou not agree?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_a_02","To be an acolyte of the Ordo Hereticus is surely the finest calling the righteous may receiveth!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_inquisition_two_a_03","Is any Inquisitorial Ordo as rightfully feared as the Ordo Hereticus? Righteous are its acolytes!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","A dark time indeed! When the very bastions of faith were laid low by the pernicious lies of Goge Vandire."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","Goge Vandire subjected the people of Terra to such horrors that they believed the Master had forsaken them."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_one_c_02","Thou couldst learn much from Lord Melk. He understands well his purpose, and seeketh no glory."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_three_b_01","Tis natural that a man of his years, in such a position, would learn much of import."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_three_b_02","Some secrets are not for the likes of thee, Freak."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_three_c_01","Forsooth, any ancient knowledge accrued by the venerable Melk is hardly thy concern."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_three_c_02","Might I remind thee that Grendyl trusteth Lord Melk implicitly."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_two_a_01","Sire Melk upbraided me for my use of Gothic speech. He claimed it was ... muddled."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_two_a_02","That ... lackey ... Melk claimeth I doth merely ape the forms and structure of Gothic speech. Charlatan!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_two_a_03","Melk claimeth I understandeth not the form of gothic speech. Really!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_two_b_01","Preposterous! Methinks his loss of station hath made his manner most distemperate."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_two_b_02","Verily doth Melk's manner groweth more vexatious with each passing day."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_melk_two_c_01","Melk wouldst know not valorous oratory if it striketh him in the visage!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_four_c_01","The sergeant is a man of serious aspect and rigid habits. The frivolous seek to demean these fine qualities."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_four_c_02","To jest on such matters is beneath you. Shame!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Mayhap the inexplicable power of Warp travel hath taken Morrow far. But at what cost?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_one_b_02","If Morrow faced the Tyrant of Badab and lived, the heretics of Atoma shouldst prove a mere trifle."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Fascinating, I'm sure, but idle tongues hasten heresy."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_one_c_02","A man is only as good as today's deeds, and Sergeant Morrow is no exception."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Trusteth the Freak to indulge in to rumour and naysaying."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_three_b_02","Were he responsible for half the deeds so attributed by gossips, he wouldst be canonized thrice over!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_three_c_02","If thou believeth every scurrilous rumour thou hears, tis hardly Morrow's fault."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_a_01","One of the faithful hath vouchsafed to me a secret. Morrow fought the Tyranids at the Battle of Macragge."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_a_02","I hath heard this day a rumor that the good Sergeant fought at the Battle of Macragge!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_a_03","Prick up thine ears, imbeciles. Tis said Sergeant Morrow fought the vile xenos at Macragge and lived!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_a_04","Though scurrilous rumour be beneath me, I heareth Morrow is no less than a veteran of Macragge."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Verily it seems impossible, but tis said time behaves differently in the Empyrean."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_b_02","The Battle for Macragge was centuries ago… Mayhap he became lost in Warp space."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Twould be miraculous if true… But the Master of Mankind has miracles to spare."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_morrow_two_c_02","If only mine own faith could'st sustain me so long."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_a_01","Praise the Mourningstar, for is it not a mighty cathedral of holy war?"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_a_04","Truly doth the Mourningstar bring righteous fury to the Master's enemies."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Thou art correct in thy summation, although the crew leaveth much to be desired."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Majestic indeed, though its crew are barely fit to serveth the Master of Mankind."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","T'will do these reprobates good to see battle for a righteous cause at last."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Dark times lie ahead - this vessel shalt yet see war in the Master's name."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Wouldst though want a man of sentiment in such a position?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_one_b_02","Pah! A man in the Interrogator's position can ill afford sentimentality."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Thou shouldst doubt not the chosen of Grendyl, for he leadeth us to glory!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_two_a_01","I deem that Interrogator Rannick wears his faith lightly ... if at all."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_two_a_02","I hath noted of late that the Interrogator's faith appeareth… less than firm."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Thou may'st be right. I hath ne'er heard him so much as uttereth the daily litany."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Perhaps… I hath not seem him offer devotions, hath thee?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_two_c_01","Appearances may be deceptive… We shouldst have faith in Inquisitor Grendyl's judgment."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_rannick_two_c_02","Dark times lie ahead. The Interrogator shalt repent his secular ways before the end."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Praise be, for through the Servitor doth the Master of Mankind enact His will."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_servitors_one_b_02","Ah, to serveth the Master for eternity, unencumbered by thought or sin."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","I tell thee it is true. The Primarchs awaken, and they shalt paint the galaxy with the Master's light!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Pity Guilliman's crusade extendeth not as far as Atoma. He would make short work of these heretics!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_a_01","Guilliman's Codex Astartes must surely rival the greatest holy texts of the Ecclesiarchy. A mighty tome!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_a_02","Has any text in the Imperium's glorious history had such influence as Guilliman's Codex Astartes?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_a_03","Dost thou think the importance of Guilliman's Codex Astartes shall ever be equalled?"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","True, Guardian. Tis much more than a book of doctrine. Many important teachings are contained within."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","By reorganising the Space Marines, Guilliman ensured that none save the Master couldst wield ultimate power."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","The truth of the Codex is that none should succumb to hubris. All must remain faithful, and humble."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","From the Golden Throne, wrought by His own hand, the Master doth protect us from the greatest enemies!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","Forsaking life itself... Sitting the Golden Throne for eternity, to protect us all. There is no greater sacrifice."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_three_c_01","I hath seen the so-called warbands of the Ordo Xenos. Ape-like creatures and gangrel Kroot working alongside humans. Tis a disgrace!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_three_c_02","They say the Jokaero art masters of strange technology, but does not that make mock of the Adeptus Mechanicus?"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_two_a_03","I have lately learned of a vile xenos called the Aeldari, who doth suffer witches and worship false idols!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_two_a_04","Let none suffer the heretic, lest they fall like the Aeldari, that thrice-cursed race of false prophets and cursed witches."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_two_b_01","Trust not their appearance. The Aeldari are as alien to the Master's faithful as the vile Tyranids, and their ways just as dangerous."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_two_b_02","The Aeldari art a race of witches. What dangers they pose in these dark times can only be guessed at."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_two_c_01","Perfidious Aeldari! Tis said they once held the stars in their grasp, and yet how they fell. They are worthy of nought but contempt!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_xenos_two_c_02","Pah! For all their mysticism and supposed intellect, they flee before the darkness like frightened children, whilst the Imperium fights on!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_four_b_01","Strength of arms is not everything, imbecile. Strength of will is worth tenfold more."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_four_c_01","I for one prefer Sister Zola's stoney façade to thine imbecilic chatter."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_four_c_02","She must possess faith indeed to transcend the dangerous knavery of Atoma."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_one_b_02","Serious matters require serious minds. Would that all were so focused."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_one_c_01","Unlike you imbeciles, Sister Zola alloweth not distraction to cloud her mind."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_one_c_02","Such mindless speculation is anathema to a dutiful servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_three_b_01","Sister Zola keepeth the gates of her mind locked and barred - mayhap tis wise 'gainst the likes of thee!"

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_two_a_02","Sister Zola showeth a sincerity sadly lacking in many of the Master's followers."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_two_a_03","Forsooth, it saddens me that more doth not follow Sister Zola's dutiful example."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_two_a_04","From her bearing I dare say the Explicator is a pious mistress. Unlike some..."

"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_two_b_02","We needeth more like her in these dark times, and fewer imbeciles."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_two_c_01","Where the righteous tread, the blessed follow."
"loc_zealot_female_a__lore_zola_two_c_02","If the Master hath seen fit to bless her, thou shouldst question her not."

"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","Blessed Master, what a trove of knowledge this is!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Consider the knowledge buried in this holy place!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Alas for Tertium that she harbours traitors to her bosom. Where dost they cower?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Fie that filthy traitors are at work within Tertium's walls. Where will our search leadeth?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","I taketh solace in the longevity this place."

"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","The Master of Mankind has presented us with this train. Must we shirk His beneficence?"
"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","The Master placeth temptation in easy reach. The righteous resist!"
"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","On second thought, tis folly to depend upon faithless machines."
"loc_zealot_female_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","So, Tech Priest, how did one of thy misguided faith end up on such a righteous mission?"

"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_indolence_a_01","Slab, are ye prepared to unleash your righteous fury on the foe?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_indolence_c_01","It matters not. I was aye certain that those rumours of indolence were nothing but pernicious slander."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_indolence_e_01","I'll tell ye another time."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lex_a_01","I got tae thinking. Ye and I serve the same cause, for the lex has nae meaning without the God-Emperor's backing."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lex_c_01","Ye need not fear that. His omnipresence reveals the smallest inconstant thought or deed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lice_a_01","On my last drop ... I cannae be certain, but I thought for a moment I glimpsed a Vindicare assassin hiding in the shadows."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lice_c_01","That be lice, nothing more."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_light_b_01","Only the glaikit trust to blind chance. Only in the God-Emperor should ye trust."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_light_d_01","And that fuel be our faith, our service, our determination ... So long as we dinnae falter, darkness cannae reign."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mentor_a_01","Ye fight with faith and zeal! It be a shame that ye also be an abomination, and therefore unworthy of redemption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mentor_c_01","Aye, with proper guidance. Frae a firm and objective mentor."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mentor_e_01","I mean to consider it, aye."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_praise_b_01","But? "
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_praise_d_01","Then I gladly ccept your compliment in the spirit it was intended. Thank ye."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pressure_a_01","I confess ... ye're not all bad, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pressure_c_01","And why do ye say that?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pressure_e_01","Aye, well it's too late now."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_a_01","All these years, and at last I've found my purpose in this den of iniquity!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_c_01","Get ye behind me! Only wrath shall serve blighted Atoma now!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_redemption_a_01","I ken it be petty and prideful to seek redemption, but my heart yearns for it all the same."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_redemption_c_01","Aye, but it was nae a boot. It was flame. Lots and lots of pulchrie flame. I can still hear the screams, begging for mercy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_redemption_e_01","So I believed at the time."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_saint_a_01","Do ye think I might be a saint one day? "
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_saint_c_01","Black were my deeds before Zola offered redemption. But a saint is pardoned of all sins and need apologise for naught."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_saint_e_01","Believe me, I know."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sealed_a_01","It matters not how many heretics we slay ... nothing ever changes."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sealed_c_01","I was nae complaining."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sealed_e_01","All right, yes! Yes I was! Just don't tell anyone."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_shouting_b_01","If that is so, it is only because I have a duty to proclaim the God-Emperor's truth far and wide!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_shouting_d_01","Perhaps another time. "
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_solace_b_01","Me? What need have I for solace?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_solace_d_01","I ... have nothing to say to you."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stupid_b_01","Aye, but then were they not glaikit, they'd nae turn from the God-Emperor's light in the first place."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stupid_d_01","Ye have a simple way of beholding the world, Slab, but today I cannae fault it."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sunshine_b_01","I cannae agree. The past shapes us all, does it not?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_sunshine_d_01","Ye are a real ray of sunshine, are ye not?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_teeth_a_01","[Growl] It's gone quiet ..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_teeth_c_01","I prefer the din of battle. I dinnae care to be left with my own thoughts."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_teeth_e_01","Black as night and full of teeth."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tool_b_01","Aye, tis a fine labour. Betimes, I wish it might never end. Alas, I be a weak and weary vessel."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tool_d_01","Indeed, Slab. It is why ye are so fit a tool for the God-Emperor's purpose."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_truth_a_01","Krall may be a rough and unassuming fellow, but he certainly has his ear to the ground."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_truth_c_01","Details, details ... as long as his gossip is juicy, what does it matter?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_truth_e_01","True? Oh, my dear sweet, innocent. There is no truth within light years of this war."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_twice_b_01","So I have often thought, but never fear - there be plenty of the blackguards to go around!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_twice_d_01","Aye, such is the spirit behind a great many interrogations. Ye and I must slake our purpose elsewhere."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_understanding_b_01","My temper? So I'm a mite furibund. It's a blessing."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_understanding_d_01","Ach, understanding is the refuge of the feeble."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_veil_b_01","Rejecting earthly favours? Very wise."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_veil_d_01","Is that so? Then there be hope for ye yet."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vigilance_b_01","Vigilance be our calling. Tis only right and proper."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vigilance_d_01","Ach, so that's how it is? Just tell him to leave ye alone. Or would ye like me to have a word?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vocation_a_01","Ye were an enforcer, were ye not?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vocation_c_01","I hope ye dinnae mean for mortal lex to contain a holy servant such as I?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_vocation_e_01","I dinnae say I be troubled. I was ... speaking in the round."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_optimist_a_01","Perhaps one day I will make a pilgrimage to Messelina Gloriana. Now that is a world in need of salvation."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_optimist_c_01","Hah! Victory here is all but assured."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_optimist_e_01","Aye? And would ye like one?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_raucous_b_01","Raucous? Nae, this be passion! It be zest and zeal! You should try it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_raucous_d_01","Would ye like some? Put a dram of colour in those peely-wally cheeks of yours."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_compliment_a_01","I admit that while Psykers are of course abominations, and scarce to be tolerated ... ye're not so bad."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_compliment_c_01","The teachings of a lifetime are not so easily set aside."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_compliment_e_01","Aye, but we can try, can we not?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_07_a_01","All Psykers should burn. Tis the only way."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_07_c_01","No promises, Freak. I like a good burning."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_08_a_01","It be burdensome to be forced to fight alongside so many Warp-touched freaks, do ye not think?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_08_c_01","Good, kin! I hadnae considered that. Oh, I foresee days upon days of holy work stretching ahead. Praise the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_screams_a_01","We may find agreement in little else, but is not a heretic's death scream the finest of sounds?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_screams_c_01","I am proud to be an instrument of death! Proud, I tell ye!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_spared_a_01","I'm glad that the God-Emperor moved me to spare your life."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_spared_c_01","Really? ... I didnae take ye for a petty mind troubled by insubstantial details."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_spared_e_01","Of course! I shall gladly do so."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_travails_a_01","When this began, I never thought I might find myself fighting alongside the like-minded, let alone friends."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_travails_c_01","Indeed he does! Now let's be about his work, kin!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_useful_a_01","I must confess that the Psykers be not entirely unuseful."
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_useful_c_01","Noted, though I'm sure ye'd not wish to blacken my reptuation, given your own little ... distractions, would ye?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__bonding_conversation_round_three_useful_e_01","Then there's nothing more to say, is there?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__calling_for_help_01","Help!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__calling_for_help_02","Help!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__calling_for_help_03","A little help?"

"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_01","Can you not go five minutes without blethering about a bit of scran?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_c_meat_b_02","Food, food, food! It's all you every bloody talk about!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_01","Give it time, kindred. Give it time."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_gas_b_02","Does anyone else feel a wee cough building?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_01","By the God-Emperor, they'll not claim my magnificent pelt!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_hunt_b_02","I'll not be vittles for some mangy Hound. Depend upon it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_01","The God-Emperor will guide us, as he ever does!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_b_02","Let hatred guide ye, kin. It'll not steer ye false!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_a_01","I ken they said that this fog was safe to breathe, but I dinnae trust it."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_a_02","Are ye sure this fog is safe? I can feel it scratching at my throat ..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_a_01","I have led my share of witch hunts, kindred. I dinnae care to be on the receiving end."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_a_02","So this is what it is like to be a hunt's quarry? I dinnae care for it at all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_01","I gladly note your words, kin. We need all the advantage we can get."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_b_02","Aye! I shall be careful to listen out. I've no desire to feel fangs in my throat."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_01_b_01","My shield be faith… But a little extra help can't hurt."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_04_b_01","Just do your duty, slab, and let us do the thinking."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_07_b_01","I prefer purification by fire, but each to their own."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_12_b_01","Aye, Slab. I fear it be beyond redemption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_16_b_01","Faith over firepower, Slab!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_17_b_01","I wouldn't liken ye'self to the heretic if I were ye."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_01_b_01","Pah! Baubles and trinkets! Ye'll get yer reward in the next life."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_02_b_01","Unfortunately, that may literally be true of these heretics."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_05_b_01","Then pray for a greater challenge. Glory comes only through suffering."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_11_b_01","That's the spirit, Slab."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_18_b_01","Aye. Seeing the fear in the eyes of the heretic is… exhilarating!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_20_b_01","Could ye not use this precious respite for prayer?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_01_b_01","Typical Slab! Ye should need no reward to serve the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_02_b_01","Trust to your betters. They speak in the God-Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_05_b_01","No. I consume nothing save for my blessed rations."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_11_b_01","We tread the path of the righteous. The God-Emperor invigorates!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_18_b_01","I think ye brain implant is malfunctioning again."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_06_b_01","These were glories once, brought low by the heretic. Don't ye forget it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_b_01","Bah! If they be righteous, then their souls would suffer no torment."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_09_b_01","Blasphemy! If ye renounce your humanity, ye renounce the God-Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_13_b_01","It is written. Only in death does duty end."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_14_b_01","I think we'd all be happier with fewer of your kind about."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_06_b_01","Only the insane have strength enough to prosper… You must be rich indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_b_01","Save your prayers for the God-Emperor, not some imaginary friend."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_09_b_01","Aye, the blasphemer is forsaken by all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_13_b_01","Feel free to wake up any time and spare us your company."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_14_b_01","Threaten me not. I'm a loyal servant of the God-Emperor, and I'll not bide it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_07_b_01","Ye've been given true purpose now. Don't waste the opportunity."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_09_b_01","No action can compensate for the curse of your freakish nature."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_13_b_01","Good! The road to salvation be paved with suffering!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_14_b_01","Protocol is the only reason I be suffering ye to live, Freak."

"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Let it bide, kindred. Better to see our labours done first."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Aye, but not until our labours are done."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","I wish I had your strength, Slab. What a reckoning there'd be."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Your brawn is a gift from the God-Emperor. Be thankful!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Whining about a bit of scran? Toughen up."

"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","A day worth fighting for, aye."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","Praise the God-Emperor and his mercy!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","I could do with putting my feet up for a spell, and no mistake."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","You're a sluggardly keeso of soldier, are ye not?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","Aye? As if you know anything other than bawdy drivel."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Save your breath for screaming and shouting, kindred."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Stay awake! We can't go dragging you around behind us, now can we?"

"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Are ye afeared of an honest stramash?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","I aye had ye down as feckless. Now I've proof from your own mouth."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","Aye, but righteous work can yet be done by those of devilish aroma."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","It's a miasma thick and bold, true enough."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Why not? It will put a fright into the heretics, if nothing else."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","A desperate measure. But then, these are desperate times."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Yet she be brought low... I feel bodements of further sorrows to come."

"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","Aye, slovenliness and heresy so often go hand in hand."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","The seed of heresy despoils all it touches. Eternal vigilance is the only safeguard!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_a_01","I shouldn't be here. My trial was rigged."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_a_02","Ach, but for a corrupt adjudicator, I'd yet be at home."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_a_03","Curse that adjudicator for imprisoning me."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Aye, a sad story. Fair brings a wee tear to my cheek."
"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","Such oppression will not stand, I promise ye."

"loc_zealot_female_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Aye, but it'll be sweaty work afore we're done. Mark my words."

"loc_zealot_female_b__come_back_to_squad_09","Alone won't end well!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__come_back_to_squad_10","Come back! Do ye hear me?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","This world deserves no less than assault by the saintly hosts of the Ecclesiarchy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","If this be a test of faith, ye shall find I have plenty to spare."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","Everywhere we turn, we hear whispers of the 'Cicatrix Maledictum'. Some blasphemous artefact, I would guess?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","It is a source of corruption, and we are the means of salvation!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","There is a rot in Atoma – a corruption that sinks its roots into the very foundations of the city."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","A marvel of human ingenuity, reaching to the skies for the glory of the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","I fear the rumoured second hive city is no mere fiction, but a nest of heresy beyond imagining."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","Slay it! Slay it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","I will end ye, Beast!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Assail it from behind! Where the scunner is weak!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Dinnae attack from the front! Strike from behind!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","I hear ye, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Aye! The God-Emperor guides me!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","The explicator seems a driven woman."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Explicator Zola is a mite brusque, is she not?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","She seems a fine servant of the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","A finer tool of righteous purpose, I've seldom seen."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","An inquisitor's acolytes are not always what they seem."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","A woman worth watching, do ye not find?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Did ye know that Explicator Zola is an Atoman native?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","It seems that this campaign is personal to the explicator. Atoma was her hame."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Origins do not interest me. Only deeds."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Aye, is that so? What does it matter?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_01","I may have… misjudged… our pilot. Self-flagellation may be in order."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_02","Never did I think to count the pilot amongst the faithful, yet she has surprised me."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_03","I have spoken with the pilot, and found her to be one of the pious, after all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_04","It transpires our pilot is of the true faith. Too devout for you sinners!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Really? I find that a mite surprising."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","I've heard it said before. I dinnae believe it now."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_01","Tis the truth! She gave to me this blessed relic, a single strand of Saint Elana’s silver hair!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_02","She gifted me this fragment of marble, which skittered from a Titanolith during her pilgrimage!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_03","Ye may doubt it, but this gift from her is proof! Tis a knucklebone of Saint Tilinia of Eydolim!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_04","The light of her faith burns bright. She even gave to me this scrap of holy text, from the Cant of Arch-Cardinal Ignato!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","By the Golden Throne, what a blessing it is to find such light in these dark times."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","Tis strange. I had thought such a relic would be … grander."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","Even our pilot is not without sin. Are you all sent to test me?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","The pilot’s moral fortitude appears … questionable."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","She shall carry us to our holy purpose, or face the consequences."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","Luckily I have enough faith for us all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Were there no more pious candidates to bear us on our mission?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","I pray the God-Emperor sees fit to delay her punishment until after we disembark."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","Doubtless another of your so-called ‘visions’."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","The pious care not what your witch-eyes see."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","I have no love for Brunt, but are we not all servants of the God-Emperor?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","Glory awaits, Templar. And yet you appear vexed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","I see worry writ large upon your face. Perhaps prayer might help?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Gambling is a sin in the Master’s eyes, as well ye know."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Tis surely beneath ye to partake in such sinful pursuits."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Slay the abomination!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","In the God-Emperor’s name, I smite ye!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Strike at its head!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","God-Emperor guide our blows upon the creature’s vile head."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","The beast falters!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Yes! Cleave the foul head from its body!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","He should give praise to the fallen, for they have martyred themselves in glorious service."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","And you know this how, witch? I doubt he would speak of his grief to you!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","Through suffering he will find redemption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","The God-Emperor will offer him solace, or glorious death in service. I care not which."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","Take this as warning – the sergeant is in vexatious mood today."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","The sergeant’s mood this day is blacker than a heretic’s mantle."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Mayhap the burden of leadership is too much for one so uncouth."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","Be thankful that his effectiveness is not dependant on his manners, for the latter are sorely lacking."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Morrow should seek solace in prayer. As should ye all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Misery maketh the man."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","I heard all on Xanatros fell to some vile xenos threat?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","Xanatros? The name has the ring of perfidy about it."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","And Morrow faced this threat? Mayhap he was part of the Inquisition, even then."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","Why was he there, I wonder? As an inquisitorial agent?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","They say Morrow fought at Armageddon. A man who beheld such glory should have gladness in his heart!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow must surely be cursed with great age, for he fought at Armageddon."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Many is the hero of the Imperium whose faith has sustained them through the centuries."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Mayhap the capricious Warp is the cause of his great age. We should watch him closely."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","He should give praise to the God-Emperor for his good fortune, rather than wallow in bitterness."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","As long as he functions still in service to the God-Emperor, his mood is irrelevant."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","Do ye not find that Tech-Priest ... disconcerting?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","That Tech-Priest ... I confess, I find her unsettling."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","She perceives a different world, I deem."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","She is loyal to God-Emperor ... although she misnames him."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","You do not want her as an enemy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Embrace her as you would any other loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_01","Praise be! In the God-Emperor’s name we shall visit redemption upon the sinners of this world!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_02","Glorious days lie before us. We few are chosen for holy purpose, in service to the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_03","At last, this world shall be delivered from darkness by our hands."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_04","In the darkest hours, it is the faithful who must light the way. Are ye ready to do the God-Emperor’s bidding?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_01","If the path to redemption were simple, the spiritual rewards would ne’er taste so sweet!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_02","The God-Emperor has forsaken ye not! Be careful of your words, lest ye be judged!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_03","With each trial ahead, we must prove ourselves worthy of the God-Emperor’s blessing!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_04","Your life of sin may yet destroy your soul. Seize this chance of redemption. For the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_01","Faith in the God-Emperor shall see us triumph."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_02","Remember that the God-Emperor stands with us!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_03","The Master of Mankind will deliver us this day!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_04","Have faith in the God-Emperor, and even sinners such as ye might triumph!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_01","The God-Emperor gives us all a burden to bear. It seems you are mine."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_02","Even your simple souls shall understand His glory before the end."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_03","Pray for His mercy, for death is the only release from duty."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_04","I shall pray for the Emperor’s guidance … and for your souls."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","So many words. So little meaning."
"loc_zealot_female_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Your eloquence is an insurmountable obstacle to simple sinners."
"loc_zealot_female_b__cover_me_01","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__cover_me_02","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__cover_me_04","Kindred! I need cover!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__cover_me_10","Cover me, my kindred!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_01","Not good…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_02","Ach, that hurts…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_03","God-Emperor, save your servant…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_04","God-Emperor be with me..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_05","Losing too much blood…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_06","Can't last much longer…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_07","The soul is willing. The flesh bleeds."
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_08","Kindred? I think I'm a goner…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_09","I won't last much longer…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__critical_health_10","Need some healing!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_zealot_female_b__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_zealot_female_b__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Help!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","Help me!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","Kill the beastie!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","The Hound, kindred! The Hound!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__disabled_by_enemy_01","Trapped!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__look_at_healthstation_04","T'is a med station!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__look_at_healthstation_05","Time to heal up, kindred!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_four_b_02","Surely ye don't mean the abhuman is also prone to mutation? Yet more corruption!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_four_c_01","There be those Slabs who fall to Chaos - dangerous aberrations all!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_01","As long as they serve the God-Emperor well, ye'll hear no complaint from me."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_b_02","While the Tithes Chamber recognises them, I tolerate them. Should that change, I'll purge them like the blasphemies they are!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_01","Those who be placed on the Register of Proscribed Citizens are beyond the God-Emperor's help."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_three_c_02","It be Neandors I dislike. A dark reflection of Man's basest form."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_two_a_01","Some say the God-Emperor gave abhumans souls... I often wonder if that's true."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_two_a_02","All things are made by the God-Emperor. Even abhumans. But do they have souls? That's the question!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_abhumans_two_a_03","Do abhumans win their place by the God-Emperor's side in death? That depends on whether they have souls."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_01","If I had to choose, I'd request a Hellhound. The smell of burning heretics fair lifts the spirits!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_four_c_02","Purging heretics with artillery is efficient, but far less satisfying than cold steel."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_one_b_01","Aye! Give me a hundred men of faith, and we'll scour this place free of blasphemers!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_01","Ach, they're the finest examples ye'll ever see of righteous hatred!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_three_c_02","If a soldier lacks the faith to stand in battle, it's only fair they face the consequences."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_01","The Imperial Guard be an impressive force, but Preachers be its beating heart!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_02","The Imperial Guard wins not through firepower, but through hatred of the blasphemer. And for that they need their Preachers."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_03","Say a prayer for the preachers of the Imperial Guard; defenders of the faith!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_four_c_01","Mayhap she's repented her wicked ways and looks for the God-Emperor's forgiveness."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_four_c_02","All the more reason to be wary of our shipmistress."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_one_b_01","Aye. Reckon she cares more for this ship than for her fellows."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_one_b_02","She sees service to the God-Emperor not as an honour, but as an imposition."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Steer clear of that one, kindred, lest ye be sent for a spacewalk without a voidsuit."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_one_c_02","Action be what she needs - something to spark the righteous fire in her belly."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_three_b_01","She be a highborn I'd guess. Power and influence come to her without struggle."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_three_b_02","From her frown, I'd say the burden of leadership weighs heavy on our shipmistress."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_three_c_01","Tread lightly, kindred. She be changeable as the wind, that one."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_three_c_02","Maybe she'll allow the God-Emperor's light into her heart before the end."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_two_a_01","Brahms spent a life on the frontier, treating with foul xenos. I don't trust her."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_two_a_03","Bad enough the Rogue Trader's black-marketeering. But treating with xenos? Ach!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_two_a_04","I swear the stench of xenos hangs over the Rogue Trader. Some sins cannae easily be erased."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_two_b_01","Aye, but if she's charges to answer, it's for the God-Emperor to judge."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Her misdeeds will be weighed and measured one day, mark my words."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_two_c_01","Nothing good comes of treating with xenos, kindred. Nothing."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_brahms_two_c_02","The xenos corrupt just as surely as the daemon."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_four_b_01","They spread contagion like we spread the God-Emperor's holy word. It is Heresy most vile."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_four_b_02","They worship a plague-daemon, who they name ""Nurgle"" - a blasphemous mound of filth and virulence."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_four_c_01","They say the Lord of Decay is jovial; that the fiend laughs as it infects the galaxy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_four_c_02","These vile heretics laugh in the face of the righteous, and we rejoice as we scour them from the God-Emperor's sight!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_one_b_01","There be no gods but the God-Emperor. All else be just inhuman things that oppose us - things we must destroy!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_one_b_02","How many times must ye see 'em flee from the light of the faithful. They be not gods. They be cowards!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Once a heretic forsakes the Emperor, death is insufficient punishment."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_one_c_02","The God-Emperor is the light and the way. Turn from that light, and all that awaits ye is pain."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_three_b_01","My reading has led me to such ravings... the hallucinations of madmen, nothing more."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_three_b_02","Calm yourself, Freak. Don't be giving me no reason to purge ye!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_three_c_01","They say we live in an age of madness, but madness be no excuse for blasphemy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Let others worry about the nature of Chaos. Let us simply bring justice to its vile servants."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_a_01","We must be on our guard always, kindred. Even the blessed Space Marines are not immune to the wiles of Chaos."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_a_02","I've heard it said that there be legions of Chaos Space Marines out there - corruptions of the blessed Adeptus Astartes."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_a_03","If it's true that even a Space Marine is not incorruptible, we must all be extra vigilant."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_a_04","Be pure of heart, kindred. Remember, if even a Space Marine can fall to Chaos, any of you can."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Aye, I've heard the tales, but I'll not believe it till I see the testament of my own eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_b_02","I'll not believe tales of the Horus Heresy. It suggests the God-Emperor may be fallible, and that cannae be true."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Think not of these things. Instead, pray for the Adeptus Astartes: defenders of the God-Emperor's light!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_chaos_two_c_02","Best not let Zola hear such talk. Or Morrow for that matter. They might doubt ye faith."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_four_b_01","It be a place of evil, where the enemy dwells."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_four_b_02","It be a sanctuary to the worst heretics, renegades and Daemons in existence."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_four_c_01","It be the source of the largest Daemon incursion ever known. The source of our greatest sorrow."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Beyond the Eye of Terror lies madness and the end of times. Beware ye its perils."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_one_b_02","The Daemon fears the faithful more than all else. Keep faith, and repel the Warp-spawn!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_one_c_01","The daemonic are without number, and their legions span the galaxy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Nobody understands the threat of Chaos, till it makes itself known..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_three_b_01","It's good that ye're vigilant against possession. Were ye not, I'd purge you myself."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_three_b_02","Watch this one, kindred. The Freak might become possessed by a Warp-spawned fiend!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_three_c_01","We might sympathise with the curse of the witch, but never - ever - show them mercy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_three_c_02","They don't call us Witch Hunters for nothing. Watch the Freak closely, kindred..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_a_01","I still cannae believe the Lion's Gate itself was assailed by Daemons."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_a_02","What dark times there be if the Lion's Gate of Terra be not safe from Daemonic incursions."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_a_03","A prayer, kindred, for the Lion's Gate of Terra. Though Daemons assail it, the gate held fast!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_a_04","Even the Lion's Gate of Terra be not safe from Daemonic incursions. Be strong, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_b_01","Aye, Guardian. Even Holy Terra be not safe while evil dwells in the hearts of men."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Daemons are drawn to corruption. There'll be a glorious purging on Terra now, that there will."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_c_01","The heresy must be exorcised utterly, lest it return all the stronger."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_daemons_two_c_02","I hope every last one of them heretics was burned to ash!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","A god He be! And one day He'll rise again, mark my words!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","There be no question. That's why he be called the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","Let the God-Emperor's light fill ye! Let His hatred of the heretic guide your wrath!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","Time we all said a wee prayer to the God-Emperor, to beg forgiveness for such loose words."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","Faith, Templar! We may yet prevail without outside aid."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Let us test our own faith against the vile heretics afore we seek assistance!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","I fear if the Adepta Sororitas came to Atoma, things would be dire indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Careful what ye wish for, Templar. Things would have to be bad to summon the Adepta Sororitas."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","It be a fine calling, bringing the God-Emperor's light to benighted worlds."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","The Missionaries kindle the ember of faith amid the ashes of aeons."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","Taking the word of the creed to brothers and sisters long lost to the stars... A noble calling!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","A Missionary be a walking temple. A holy warrior out there in the unknown. Praise be!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_02","We move with glorious purpose! Maybe the Holy Synod themselves might hear of our deeds."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_03","Fight with righteousness, kindred, and ye names may yet be heard by the Holy Synod themselves!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_04","Purge the heretics, and the Holy Synod may add your names to the psalms!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","A poor preacher might dream, Guardian. There be no shame in it."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Purge such thoughts of personal glory from ye mind, and be redeemed!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","The Synod were founded by Sebastian Thor himself. It be a lofty institution indeed!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","The Synod be the holiest of the God-Emperor's servants. His very voice on Earth!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","The fate of the mutant is to be purged!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","If your skills were more reliable, Freak, nobody would need to get hurt in the pursuit of information."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","If you find our work unpalatable, there be a place on a Black Ship for ye I'm sure."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","If in doubt, burn them all. The God-Emperor will know his own!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","The heretic might receive absolution in death. The traitor will suffer in this life and the next."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_01","Of all thrice-cursed mutants, the rogue psyker surely be the worst."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_02","I tell ye, kindred, tolerating the psyker be a slippery path to damnation..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_03","Beware the witch: they pose the greatest threat to the faithful."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_04","Beware the witch. The unsanctioned psyker be a blasphemy against the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","At least they bear their heresy outwardly. The traitor hides it in his soul."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Their minds be like open gates, and the baying hordes of Chaos be waiting on the threshold!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","Nonetheless, we must be unsleeping in vigilance, and strong of mind."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","Strengthen your minds with faith! Only then can ye defeat the witch!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","The Indomitus Crusade be the most glorious muster of heroes for ten thousand years!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","Aye, but they died with hearts full of zeal and faith a-burning in their eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","Remember kindred, we play our own small part. Every heretic we destroy restores light to the darkness."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","We be fighting more of the malefic witch than ever before. Dark times, I tell ye. Dark!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Aye, Freak. And it be why I'm watching you ever more closely..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","We see the disruption of reality on a scale undreamt. And yet, the light of Terra endures!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","The heretic be driven mad by visions of wickedness. But the faithful be guided by visions of the miraculous!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_01","Dark days, kindred, dark days. But worse still for them poor souls in the Imperium Nihilus, beyond the Great Rift."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_02","The Great Rift has severed the God-Emperor's realm. The Imperium Nihilus lies beyond His blessed sight."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_03","Spare a thought for the billions of souls in the Imperium Nihilus. The Great Rift has consigned them to darkness."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_04","Some say the Great Rift be the very gates of Hel, and none know it better than those in the Imperium Nihilus."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","Aye, Guardian, our prayers be with the God-Emperor's servants who even now fight on for the Imperium!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","The ""Dark Imperium"" they call it, for the God-Emperor's light no longer illuminates it."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","They say a thousand Space Marine chapters remain lost... Prayers be with the God-Emperor's chosen warriors."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","All we can do is our part, kindred. We fight the heretic in what ways we can, in the god-Emperor's name!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","We'll be told when we're worthy, and not before."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","If ye believe our purpose to be righteous, then ye trust in Grendyl to lead us."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","Ha! Ye'd have the Inquisition reveal their secrets? That be madness."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","Blessed is he with the closed mind. Damned is he who questions…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Silence, witch! It be not your place to question the Inquisition."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","You should count yer blessings for that, Freak."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","Grendyl need only command, and I'll see righteous fire visited upon our enemies!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_01","Do ye not agree that Grendyl be a paragon of faith?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_02","Kindred, can ye not feel righteous faith in every word Grendyl utters?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_03","Inquisitor Grendyl truly be a faithful scion of the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_04","It be glorious to serve one of the true faith like Grendyl!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","Aye. The light of the God-Emperor guides Grendyl's steps."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Grendyl calls us to holy work, and we must answer!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Obedience without question: that's proper faith!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","If ye lack strength, the next best thing is a strong leader!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_four_b_01","What? The Tech-Priest does nothing but bark and blether!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Ye hit your head, Brute? The Tech-Priest's havering gives me a headache."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Maybe the Brute has an instinct for commands. Like a pet."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_four_c_02","To truly understand the Tech-Priest's blethering would be one of the God-Emperor's miracles."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_one_b_01","More pragmatic than most of her creed, but soulless all the same."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_one_b_02","She be diligent in her duties, even if her faith be questionable."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_one_c_01","The Tech-Priest be a dour, sleekit sort, but her diligence cannot be faulted."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_one_c_02","The Tech-Priests skills have saved us many a time, even if her manner be strange."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Ye best not be prying on us!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Ye be here under sufferance, freak. Test me not!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_three_c_01","I knew it be a mistake to bring a psyker along…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_three_c_02","God-Emperor preserve us from the unnatural powers of the witch!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_a_01","If ye think Morrow be old, what about the Tech-Priest? Older still, I reckon."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_a_02","I'd be not surprised to learn the Tech-Priest is centuries old, judging by appearances."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_a_03","There be something unnatural about the Tech-Priest, like she's seen too many years."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_a_04","The Tech-Priest seems blessed with great age."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Weakness of the flesh be removed, but at what cost to the soul?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_b_02","At least she be not stripped of all humanity, like others of her kind."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_c_01","Aye, we can all dream of serving the God-Emperor beyond the span of mortal years."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hadron_two_c_02","Such longevity be wasted on a soulless machine."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","The wages of sin be not so gratifying as righteous work."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","I hear the work be both dangerous and dishonest."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Money is well and good, but wouldn't ye rather fight for faith?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Stick with us, brute, and ye may yet feel the God-Emperor's blessing."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","I not be one for idle gossip, soldier. But… What have ye heard?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","You mean the Purser? I fear she not be one of the true faith."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","The interrogator dislikes her much… I trust his judgment."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","She be an enemy to Rannick, I hear. Make yerselves scarce when they lock horns."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Aye, and I've heard nothing good comes from bartering with her."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","There's a saying: never trust a merchant with gold teeth."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","The penitent have no need of worldly possessions. Just as well…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","If she opened her heart to the God-Emperor, she'd cast aside her miserly ways."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_01","What make ye of the purser, kindred? Seems her behaviour grows worse by the day."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_02","The purser be not a woman of faith. Dark deeds lurk in her past, mark my words."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_03","The purser be raucous in her cups, and quick to anger. A faithless sort."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_04","Watch out for the purser, kindred. She's got a mean streak a mile wide."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Aye. Little more than a bodyguard I hear, playing at being purser."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Agreed. She been too long outside the God-Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","One black look from her could turn back an orbital bombardment."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She be the worst kind of tyrant. The faithless kind."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Those of rank live spireside, where we pray they remain safe."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","There be the God-Emperor's chosen few. The rulers of the hive and all within."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Those who scale the pinnacles of glory have the furthest to plunge into the abyss."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","The privileged few be the God-Emperor's chosen, but only so long as they be beyond reproach."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Aye, Templar. I'd love a wee crack at ministering to this rabble, if you take my meaning."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","They be lacking the God-Emperor's guidance, administered with a firm hand."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","They transgress against the God-Emperor's law. Permitting them to live is a crime in itself."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","A hive-city is a marvel of human ingenuity, reaching to the skies in exultation to the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Ninety billion souls in a city so tall it pierces the atmosphere. How can anyone not see it as a miracle?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Maybe your faith'll be restored once we get these thrice-cursed heretics out of here."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","When our mission is done, kindred, maybe ye'll see Hive Tertium with fresh eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_01","Atoma be called the jewel in the crown of Moebian industry. It must be saved!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_02","Atoma's manufactorums be a part of the God-Emperor's great plans. We can't let them fall."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_03","The Manufactorums of this hive be vital to the war effort. By the God-Emperor, we must protect them."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_04","They say each manufactorum on Atoma is worth three lesser factories in the segmentum."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Hard work conquers everything. Blessed are they who toil in the God-Emperor's name."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Moebian steel be the finest in the segmentum, and the secrets of its forging be Atoma's greatest asset."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","Hard work earns salvation. The labourers may die content, but the metalfabs are irreplaceable."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","The dead cry out for revenge. It be our duty to provide it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Will the Bell of Lost Souls mark our passing? I think not."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_four_c_01","I suppose ye'd have them make a Titanolith of you as well! To stand alongside Dracos the Conqueror?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_four_c_02","Who do ye think you are? Sebastian Thor? Ha!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Maybe one day I'll meet a pilgrim who trod Terran soil. I'd be content just with that."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_one_b_02","I be unworthy even to dream of seeing the Ecclesiarchal Palace of Holy Terra."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_one_c_01","Maybe I'll take on the pilgrimage when my duty be done. God-Emperor willing."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Terra lives in our hearts. Revere it, as ye would the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_three_b_01","The tithe grade be calculated with care. A world only pays what it can afford to give."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_three_b_02","Don't doubt the Administratum, Freak. The Imperial Tithe be fairly reckoned."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_three_c_01","Those who forget their duty have no place in the bosom of humanity."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Death awaits those who would shun their obligations to the Imperium."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_a_01","To think, the Imperium contains a million worlds, maybe more!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_a_02","The God-Emperor rules a million worlds. Does it not fill ye with awe?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_a_03","This world be but one of a million that make up the Imperium."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_a_04","The God-Emperor rules a million worlds. He'll not let a single one fall. Not even this one."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_b_01","In a vast galaxy, ye'll not be missed unless ye hold the faith!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Don't think our work here be fruitless. The God-Emperor has plans for us all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_c_01","And at the heart of the Imperium lies Holy Terra - the cradle of Humanity!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Even Atoma can be redeemed. The God-Emperor will welcome it back into the fold."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","I wouldn't tempt fate, Slab. Not without an agent of the Ordo Sicarius present to control them."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","Pah! This be a job for the Inquisition, not some sneekit scrowl!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","What I wouldn't give to see the Eversor at work. Naet more honest than a blade to the ribs."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Long as it's an Eversor. Looking the heretic in the eye as ye slay him. That's the God-Emperor's work!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","I've always been fond of the Atmospheric Incinerator... Cleanse the world with fire!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","The Atmospheric Incinerator has a certain appeal."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","I'd be loath to destroy this world. Not while there's souls to be saved."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","In an Imperium of a million worlds, what matters the loss of one?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","If the God-Emperor's laws had been applied with vigour, we'd not be needed here."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","It be a responsibility that weighs heavy on the shoulders of the chosen."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","Look to the Lex Imperialis, kindred. It'll steer ye true."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","I read the Lex Imperialis daily. No infraction gets past me."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_01","Be there any more righteous calling than the Ordo Hereticus?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_02","The work of the Ordo Hereticus surely be the most vital in the Imperium!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_03","Of all the Ordos of the Inquisition, Hereticus be the calling of the faithful!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_04","Ye should be proud, kindred. The Ordo Hereticus be the pinnacle of righteousness!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","Finally, I can burn heretics without fear of arrest!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","You know what they say, kindred: true happiness is a hobby that becomes your job."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","After the Age of Apostasy, a creed like ours were sorely needed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","Heresy blooms in the unlikeliest places, and the Ordo Hereticus must root it out."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","The God-Emperor's will and the Machine Spirit within make the workings of the throne unknowable."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","Belief, Slab! Our belief in the God-Emperor. His belief in the might of the Imperium. Belief is all!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Only the God-Emperor can power the throne. By his unending vigil are we kept safe."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","The throne and the God-Emperor are as one, and while both endure, the Imperium endures."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","His blessed crusade was an example to all!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","The Imperium were crying out for a hero like Saint Macharius."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","They say he wanted to push on to the Halo Zone, beyond the light of the Astronomican."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","If he'd been surrounded by braver heroes, he might even have conquered the Halo Zone."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","An open mind be like a fortress with its gate unbarred and unguarded. Ignorance is strength!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","I'll have ye know I learned much about burning heretics from the glorious Age of Redemption!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Reach out to embrace the glories that will come, and dwell not on the sins of the past."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","In an hour of Darkness a blind man be the best guide. Heed this lesson well."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_01","Could be worse, kindred. We could be in the Age of Apostasy, the blackest era in history."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_02","Sometimes I think back to the Age of Apostasy, where the Ecclesiarchy almost fell, and weep."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_03","There was a time when the Ecclesiarchy was all but destroyed. It was the Age of Apostasy, our darkest hour."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_04","Kindred, I've been meditating of late on the Ecclesiarchy's darkest hour: the Age of Apostasy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","The Reign of Blood, brought about by the traitor, Goge Vandire. May he burn with helfire still!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","The Reign of Blood, they called it. Goge Vandire, the false Ecclesiarch, was the vilest of traitors."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Were it not for Sebastian Thor, the Ecclesiarchy wouldn't have survived Vandire's plot."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","We give praise still to Sebastian Thor and the Confederation of Light, saviours of the Imperium!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_four_b_01","It must be so, brute for him to hold his position."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_four_b_02","We all be loyal to the God-Emperor, yet we be not so insufferable."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_four_c_01","His allegiance be not in doubt… but what of his faith?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_four_c_02","A lifetime of service. A lifetime of secrets."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_one_b_01","Don't go letting Grendyl hear you say that. It's Lord Melk tae the likes of you!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_one_b_02","Careful. With a stroke of his quill the venerable Lord Melk could have ye jettisoned."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_one_c_01","Barely understand a word Melk says, but I respect his diligence."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_one_c_02","His talents be many. The art of conversation be not amongst them."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_three_b_01","I hope ye not be crawling about inside the administrator's head, witch."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_three_b_02","Are ye prying on the thoughts of our fellows again, witch?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_three_c_01","For all his airs and graces, he be here for the same reason as the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_three_c_02","No one joins this crew willingly. He be paying a debt, or seeking redemption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_a_01","I believeth not that Melk judgeth my diction to be improper!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_a_02","That fellow Melk took issue with my vocabulary. Can ye believe that?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_a_03","According to Melk I be too uncouth in language to give a good sermon!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_a_04","Lord Melk think me language be uncouth. He can go boil his head!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_b_01","He's a cold fish. He don't understand the righteous fire of a good sermon."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_b_02","Pah! Melk's just a sklaterscrae, ye ken?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_c_01","In the end, we be judged on the purity of our souls, not the state of our diction."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_melk_two_c_02","The man should spend less time planning and more time praying."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_four_b_01","Impossible - the only cure for such corruption be the mercy of death."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_four_b_02","A wicked rumour, to place doubt on the purity of such a man."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_four_c_01","It'd explain his dour demeanour, but it be an outlandish claim."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_four_c_02","It be unwise to court corruption with such loose talk."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Morrow's a war hero for sure, but this sounds like a tall tale indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_one_b_02","I'd barely be surprised. He's a wicht one for sure."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_one_c_01","If all these stories be true, Morrow deserves a sainthood."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_one_c_02","I'd quit yer havering if I were ye."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Maybe he seeks glorious death in service to the God-Emperor. Ye wouldn't understand."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_three_b_02","A man who beheld such glories would be of more cheer, don't ye think?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_three_c_01","The sergeant strikes me not as a blowhard, so who be telling the tales?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_three_c_02","There be no doubting his skill in battle, even if there's a shadow over his past."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_a_01","Kindred, have ye heard about Morrow? They say he fought the Tyranids at Macragge."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_a_02","I can scarce believe it… I hear Morrow fought at Macragge, and saved the life of Lord Calgar himself!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_a_03","If the rumours be true, Morrow served at Calth, and fired the very shot that gave Old One Eye its name!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_a_04","Hark, kindred! Did ye hear our very own Morrow is a decorated hero of Macragge?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Seems a tall tale indeed. It's unbefitting to haver so."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Weesht! Morrow would be long in his grave if it were true."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_c_01","I don't doubt Morrow's tenacity, but he be just a man."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_morrow_two_c_02","If half the tales of Morrow be true, he must indeed be blessed by the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_01","The Mourningstar be a fine vessel, kindred. A mighty cathedral of war!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_02","I be awestruck at the might and majesty of the Mourningstar."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_03","The God-Emperor chose a mighty cathedral of war in the Mourningstar."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_04","With the Mourningstar as our craft, what heretic be fool enough to stand before us?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Aye, and yet it serve the likes of Brahms. The God-Emperor's ways be strange."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","A thing of beauty, sure enough, wrought by artisans."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","Leastways it now be pressed into righteous service."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","The Mourningstar will carry us to glory, kindred, be sure of it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Maybe Rannick's presence in battle would be more a hindrance than a help."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Rannick be the Emperor's voice. We be his sword!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_four_c_01","I don't doubt the strength of his conviction; only the strength of his arm."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_four_c_02","It be his loss, kindred. He's missing out on righteous glory!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He be a fair taskmaster, devoted to rooting out heresy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_one_b_02","A man of rare devotion to the cause he is."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Victory against the vilest foe: that's the only way to earn his respect."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_one_c_02","If it be Rannick's trust ye want, ye'll have to earn it."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_three_b_01","He's steered us true so far - maybe he be chosen by the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Advancement within the Holy Ordo be a noble and honourable pursuit."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_three_c_01","We must trust that he'll see this holy mission through."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_three_c_02","He does righteous work. Let the God-Emperor judge how well."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_two_a_01","Something bothers me about the Interrogator… I fear he be lacking in faith."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_two_a_02","Ye ever see Rannick give prayer? I reckon he be not a devout man."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_two_b_02","I don't believe it - it's his faith that makes him braw."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_two_c_01","He may not show it, but I reckon Rannick be as faithful as any of us."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_rannick_two_c_02","If he weren't a righteous man, he wouldn't lead us to victory."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_four_c_01","They fester in distant colonies and crowded hives. That's why ye need Missionaries to root them out."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_four_c_02","They thrive in nests of the faithless, but like all xenos they shrink from the righteous!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_one_b_01","We've blasphemy enough to contend with, kindred, without worrying about accursed xenos."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_three_c_02","Even studying the physical form of the alien is heresy. They are to be destroyed, utterly and without trace!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_a_01","Ye think it's true that the Aeldari worship false idols?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_a_02","The Aeldari think themselves a race of prophets, but mark my words they're headed for a fall."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_a_03","I hear some in the Inquisition put stock in Aeldari prophecies. That way lies madness!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_a_04","Some say the Aeldari are wise. I say they deserve nought but hate!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_b_01","Heard they summon fire-wreathed daemons to their aid. Proof of their heretical natures!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_b_02","They bring their so-called god to battle. It be an affront to all we hold sacred."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_c_01","For all we know, their dabbling brought about these dark times!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_xenos_two_c_02","They've fought with us many times, it's said, but always they betray us in the end."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_four_b_01","A brute ye may be, but sometimes ye speak a mote of sense."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_four_b_02","Aye. The explicator has been forged in the crucible of strife."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_four_c_02","She doesn't shrink from righteous battle, unlike some I could mention."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_one_b_01","Hearts and minds be not won with mirthless demeanour."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_one_b_02","Aye, we must hope she be as devout as she appears."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_one_c_01","Dark times be ahead, kindred, and that'll test her mettle."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_one_c_02","We'll see if her faith in the God-Emperor holds when all this be done."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_three_b_01","A chequered past be valuable motivation for the righteous."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_three_b_02","Aye, she's afeared of something, but it be not for you to discover, Freak."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_three_c_01","The God-Emperor bids us follow her, so follow her we will."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_three_c_02","She's been plucked from ignominy by the God-Emperor. That be enough for me."

"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_two_b_01","Aye, but she's a dour one. There be trouble in her past, mark my words."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_two_b_02","Outwardly, maybe, but the content of her heart be concealed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_two_c_01","If she leads us to glorious battle against the God-Emperor's enemies, it be enough for me."
"loc_zealot_female_b__lore_zola_two_c_02","Trust to your own faith, kindred, not that of others."
"loc_zealot_female_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Faith cannot move this burden alone!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","There be many secrets buried here ... I can smell them."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Learning be nothing next to faith, kindred."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Where do you suppose these traitors may be found?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Traitors in our midst. Who do ye suppose they are?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","I'm glad of the battle. It hides the click-whirr of all those soulless servitors."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","A grand edifice, aye, but did it need so many servitors?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","I don't take kindly to all this ... sloshing around."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Smells like heresy down here. Old, liquefied heresy."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Ye be an odd one, Tech Priest. How came ye to join this kindred?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","The God-Emperor's ways are mysterious. Why else would he send ye here, Tech-Priest?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Aye. We all serve the God-Emperor in our own way..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Fine. Just do ye duty, and let the God-Emperor be the judge of ye."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cartel_shanty_02","The faithful need neither riches nor comfort. Cleanliness, however …"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cartel_water_course_01","The water seethes with corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cartel_water_course_02","I wonder how many have met their doom in this river?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Ach, the scunnered thing's too slow! Fight with zeal, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","There be time enough to slay heretics afore the elevator arrives!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Not that I'm not enjoying the run-around, but why are we doing this?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","The hairs on my palms are twitching, kindred. There's more to this than is let on."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","Aye, I thought it'd be something of the sort."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","We're doomed, I tell ye."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","Assuming we don't all die in the next few minutes, who's getting this message anyhow?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","I'm still not clear on who's getting this transmission."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Aye well ... ye cannae blame a body for trying."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","I thought ye'd say that."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","I confess, I've a hankering to know more about the message."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","I cannae deny ... this message intrigues me."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Aye, worthy enough. Wars turn on less."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","I be satisfied, though this secrecy rankles my soul."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Ach, I'd far prefer to be hunting an arch-heretic than delivering missives."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Aye, this is a strange one. No business of mine."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_way_in_01","Praise the God-Emperor, but I think we can go this way!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_complex_way_in_02","Do ye see that, kindred? The very door we seek!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Aye, the traitors have been busy here? Can it be repaired?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Defiled, all of it! Can the desecration be undone?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Fancy words. Be more direct in future."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","[Sigh] Directness and simplicity are not your virtues."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The loss of workers will cost this place."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","So many dead labourers. Martyrs all … who'll toil in their stead?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","The God-Emperor, in his wisdom, has a plan for us all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","To give one’s life in service to the God-Emperor. That's true glory."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Is one manufactorum really so vital?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","All this for a single manufactorum, eh?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Praise be to the God-Emperor! We have a duty to perform."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","We shall triumph this day, just ye see!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_heat_01","The heat of redemption. It purifies!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_leaving_02","Damnation behind us,  glory ahead. What a life!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","There is far to fall. Further still, for the faithless."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Don't mind the drop. Each step we take is one step closer to salvation."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Push onwards to Coolant Control!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","Tarry not! We must reach Coolant Control!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Ah, armour almost as strong as faith!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Leman Russ battle tanks … Named for a legend."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","They sleep beside their stations? Such dedication is its own reward."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","The workers have made a hab-chamber here. It's humbling to see such devotion."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_deception_01","Deceiving the heretics should be simple enough."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_deception_02","Deceive a nest of heretics? Aye, I can do that."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","Ach! A proud hall of justice, now in ruins."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Many a heretic has been sentenced here, and will be again!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Nary an enforcer to be seen."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","If the enforcers' faith had been true, they'd still be around."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Ach, sounds like the enforcers were too soft!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Where lenience dwells, heresy thrives."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Were ye not raised hereabouts, explicator? Did your sordid past bring you to these blocks?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","I reckon you know the dark secrets of this place all too well, explicator."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I think ye should pray for forgiveness, explicator. While you can."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","The God-Emperor has given ye a second chance, explicator. Use it wisely."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Prison be a strange place for a heretic to hide."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","So the arch-heretic hides in a prison? A cowardly foe!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","You'd need faith indeed to live up there."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","The strongest faith will shake if its foundations be weak."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","A crime in itself that such a feat of engineering falls to rust and ruin."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","Such disrepair. The governance of this hive is found wanting."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","Such reeking foulness beneath the feet of civilisation… Now there's a lesson."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","Ach, by the Throne, that reek!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","A more iniquitous marketplace ye'll ne'er see…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","I think the trading at this market was not of the sanctioned kind."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Mind your footing, kindred. This hab's all a-squint."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","What's so special about these battle tanks, that we be sent here?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","The God-Emperor protects!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Hear that, kindred? We cannae shirk from our duty here."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Be ye trustworthy, Tech-Priest? Ye say little enough."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Careful, kindred: we know nothing about this Mechanicus 'priest'."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","If all ye do is blether, maybe ye should keep quiet after all."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Now I know more about ye, but like ye less."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","The God-Emperor protects! Why else be this place not destroyed?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","There be hope yet, kindred. The heretics have failed to defile this metalfab."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","There be darkness ahead should the heretic succeed..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Then our duty is clear, kindred! Do not falter."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Find the smelter, kindred! There be the path to redemption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Righteous cause be found at the smelter, aye?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Come, kindred, lest ye burn like a blasphemer!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_hellhole_02","We should seek the God-Emperor's sanctuary elsewhere."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Yon machines be dormant. The God-Emperor's purpose thwarted."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_lifeless_02","The death of industry be an insult to the litanies of duty."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","Have at it, kindred! We'll meet the heretics head-on!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","Through the main gate, kindred. To victory in the emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Sad to see this place empty. Honest toil is the God-Emperor's gift."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_propaganda_02","The workers here had great purpose. Cheers ye hearts, does it not?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Hold them back! The God-Emperor will deliver us, ye'll see!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Make a stand, kindred. The righteous will prevail!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","Ach... The scunnered smell of corruption is on the air."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Be on ye guard, kindred. The very air be thick with corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Is this manufactorum so vital to the God-Emperor's plan?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","This place feels foul, yet it be vital to our plan... Why so?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_hack_01","I have ever been a seeker of truth. Today is no different."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_hack_02","Come, kindred! We have a machine to interrogate!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_hack_03","We will have the truth from this machine!"

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","To be enslaved by this reeking abomination be fair reward for heresy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","How deep does the rot go, I wonder?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Is this the only place befouled?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Be not afeared kindred, for the God-Emperor's light be with us!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","A blasphemy, birthed into creation by faithless minds."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Abomination! Ye'll not block the path of the righteous for long."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","Avoid the elevator, kindred, it is rife with corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A mere vox-broadcast cannae corrupt those of true faith."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Trust to the God-Emperor, kindred, and the words of the heretic can harm ye not."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","By the Throne… One slip and ye'll be dining in Hel."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","It's a long way down, kindred, both for body and soul."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","God-Emperor save our tired legs…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Dig deep, kindred. The road to redemption be long. And tiresome."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Breathe it in, kindred. Clean air, free of heresy's foul taint."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","The air tastes almost pure… Doubtless it be a heretic trick."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Now there be a sight for sore eyes. I feel a prayer coming on…"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Don't let the view turn ye heads, kindred. Our real work is down there, in the dark."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","Did ye hear that, kindred?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","What just happened?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","I've a bad feeling about this ..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","Mourningstar? Can ye hear?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","I cannae reach the Mourningstar! The vox is dead."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_district_gate_02","No way through. The district gate be shut fast."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","The Logistratum? At last, though I do not ken why it matters so."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","A grand place in its prime, but what use is the Logistratum now?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Caution, kindred. Holding this place be no easy task."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","I'm afeared that holding this place might hasten our martyrdom..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","I think ye know more about this place than ye let on, Explicator."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Scuttling about in the dark like heretics..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_trains_01","Those trains be carrying corruption hither and thither..."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_rails_trains_02","A prayer, kindred, that these ill-kempt gantries don't fall on our heads!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Let's fill these bonny streets with blood, kindred."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","A fine night for a slaughter, so it is."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Aye, the bridge is a tardy blagger."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","We're trapped until yon bridge is down."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","I'm in no mood for a holy death this day, kindred."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","Let them come! I'm in the mood for a stramash!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Bring your worst, heretics! The God-Emperor wants ye dead!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","That pulpit be long empty, I reckon."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","I hope that pulpit's preacher died with his teeth in a heretic's throat."

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","I feel a wee bit of slaughter coming on! Who's with me!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","It's all a bit clean and polished for me. Makes me suspicious."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","Too clean and tidy. There be rot here, count on it!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_retrieve_01","We are all here to serve the God-Emperor. But some are more suited to such labours than others."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_retrieve_02","Would ye make me a beast of burden, to bear such loads?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scan_01","Mechanisms and binharic mysticism. Hah! What use are they?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scan_02","Let the tech-savants put their faith in devices. I will trust the God-Emperor alone."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","A bright day! The God-Emperor lights our way!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Turn your eyes to the sun! Is the God-Emperor's light not glorious?"

"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","What are a few centuries in the God-Emperor's immortal life?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","The God-Emperor shall see it reclaimed, have no doubt."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","We shall purge the heretics with flame! How else would we combat a plague?"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Corruption within, corruption without. I am not surprised."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Pestilence is the bodily manifestation of heresy."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Faith is all the protection I need against such foul concoctions."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","This place once thronged with the faithful."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Unfitting to see this place of sanctioned commerce laid low."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","The endeavours of mankind may be fleeting, but the glory of the God-Emperor is eternal!"
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","I believe this place will thrive once more, once reclaimed."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_interior_01","Looks ready to collapse. Shoddy work."
"loc_zealot_female_b__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Mind your step, kindred. Wouldn't want this place to become our tomb."

"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_directionless_d_01","Do not be sorrowful. You cannot help that I am your better."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_faithful_deeds_b_01","All who fight this war are proven faithful by the very act of their striving."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_faithful_deeds_d_01","You define too narrowly the bounds of faith. If you did otherwise, you might be less ... aggrieved."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fire_a_01","These Moebian traitors could not have done so much without aid. "
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fire_c_01","Indeed. I fear we battle the symptoms while the disease runs deeper than we can know."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fulfilment_b_01","Yours is a soul ever-yearning for fulfilment. But purpose cannot come from without, only within."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fulfilment_d_01","By our service, we reflect the Beneficent Emperor's purpose, but only we can choose to embrace it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_holy_tome_a_01","If you should happen to see a holy tome among the rubble, please alert me."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_holy_tome_c_01","It gladdens me that you understand. I confess, I did not take you for a man of learning."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_holy_tome_e_01","I meant no offence ... I apologise without reserve."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_interpreter_a_01","We will cleanse Atoma, even if we must burn the entire world to do so."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_interpreter_c_01","Because I speak from the heart, not malice."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_interpreter_e_01","Then it may be he should find a new interpreter."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tutelage_b_01","Why, thank you. It is the product of many long years of tutelage and selfless dedication."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tutelage_d_01","You have nothing to regret. We each walk our own path."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_yearneth_b_01","As do I, but I fear that day lies far in the future."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_yearneth_d_01","Indeed we must. Let the heretics beware!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_favour_a_01","Remember: serve with distinction, and the Beneficent Emperor will look upon you favourably."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_favour_c_01","He too will face the Emperor's judgement one day. If he executes you without cause, that judgement may go against him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_laxity_a_01","It gladdens me to see that not all Psykers are weak, corruptible beings."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_laxity_c_01","-- but it takes only a moment's laxity to undo a lifetime of diligence. Know that if I am forced to kill you, I shall do so with great regret."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_like_you_b_01","Thank you, Slab, but such things are for the Beneficient Emperor to decide, not you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_like_you_d_01","An ... acceptable compromise. My thanks."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_06_a_01","I regret that the world has treated you badly, but what else can be done with a Freak such as you?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_06_c_01","It was objective truth."
"loc_zealot_female_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_sleep_b_01","Vigilance never sleeps. I long for the day when I can do without sleep entirely."

"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_01","Let it be so! I prefer to see the light fade from a heretic's eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_02","It is for the best. A righteous soul without bloody hand is not truly righteous."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_01","I did not expect such compassion from you, Guardian. Much less for it to be so misplaced."

"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_a_01","Pay heed to the baying, pilgrims. It is a sure sign that a Hound is close!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_a_02","Hounds, like heretics, cannot help but to announce their presence. Heed the warning!"

"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_01_b_01","You'll get your medal, Slab. When you're done."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_02_b_01","Or you could do your job properly the first time, perhaps."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_05_b_01","Easy? [out of breath] I would hate to see what you consider difficult."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_11_b_01","They will not mess twice."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_18_b_01","We're all safer when you're not firing a gun."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_20_b_01","Slab, wait... Is he already asleep?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_02_b_01","Follow them well, Brute, for the Imperium and Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_06_b_01","Why must I suffer your companionship?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_10_b_01","I am not surprised."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_14_b_01","You are a delicate creature indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_18_b_01","No matter, so long as your thoughts are filled with purpose."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_19_b_01","Throne preserve us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_06_b_01","You can complain, or you can help cleanse it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_b_01","If thousand souls cry out for vengeance, you must answer."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_09_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor has a plan for you, Psyker. Remember that."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_13_b_01","Then use this time to gather your strength for the fight to come."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_14_b_01","Shirk not from the path ordained for you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_06_b_01","Nothing about this is right. Especially the way you talk of your ""beloved""."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_b_01","When will you learn this is no dream?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_09_b_01","You come dangerously close to heresy, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_13_b_01","Ignore the Psyker. More nonsense."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_14_b_01","However did he reach that conclusion?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_07_b_01","Duty would not have forgotten you. Trust to that."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_b_01","Familiarity invites temptation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_b_01","There is a higher law even than the Lex Atoma."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_19_b_01","I have discipline fit to shatter mountains. Training will attend to itself."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_01_b_01","Only those who have nowhere left to be."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_04_b_01","[laughing] I feel better already."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_b_01","Beneficent Emperor give me strength..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_12_b_01","Oh, I am keeping score, Templar."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_16_b_01","Take strength from your past. Use it to build a better future."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_17_b_01","You should be glad I have not brought the laud-hailers."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_01_b_01","Be grateful for another chance to serve."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_04_b_01","I am glad to see you enjoy this holy work."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_b_01","What exactly would we be learning?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_12_b_01","Oh, you are observed, Templar. Have no fear of that."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_16_b_01","I am ready to die, if that is what He has ordained."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_17_b_01","Yes. Are you sure it is your uniform?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_01_b_01","Indeed, pilgrim. In the striving we find purpose!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_b_01","Your example is an inspiration. See that it remains so."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_b_01","We fight to our last breath. The Beneficent Emperor demands it!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_b_01","All will unfold as the Beneficent Emperor wills."

"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_09_b_01","Well said, Pilgrim!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_13_b_01","Pray, and He will give you strength!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_14_b_01","There is only righteous judgement."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_02_b_01","I am not afraid."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_06_b_01","Beneficent Emperor, make me the channel of your vengeance!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_07_b_01","I am with you, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_09_b_01","He will not find us lacking."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_13_b_01","Pray, and He will give you courage."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_14_b_01","Abhor the heretic and the mutant!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_a_01","We have a moment. Who will lead us in prayer?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_02_a_01","The heretics cannot stand against our faith."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_a_01","Fear is a weapon of the enemy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_b_01","Then let us turn it against them!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_04_a_01","Zeal shall be your greatest weapon!"

"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_05","The Beneficent Emperor has sent us to cleanse this place!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Beneficent Emperor, bless this holy work!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_07","Bear witness to the rewards of sin!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_08","See, Pilgrims! Our righteousness has been rewarded!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_09","We have achieved much, but there is more still to do."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Beneficent Emperor, this slaughter is my offering to you!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","Have faith. You are as the Beneficent Emperor intended you to be."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","""Human"" is the important part of the word."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","I trust the Beneficent Emperor to guide my hand."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","Pah. To aim would be to doubt the Emperor's plan."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","Your zeal transcends your aim, I fear."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","Another cursed weapon. Who would have believed it?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","How much ammunition can a single pilgrim require?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Is your aim so bad you require all the ammunition?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Might I petition you for some ammunition? If you have anything to spare, that is."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","Put it to good use, then."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","On this occasion my zeal exceeded my judgement. My contrition."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Have you both eaten and slept of late, Pilgrim?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","We shall soon find a righteous war to distract you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Then pray for guidance, Psyker. And for His mercy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","Do you ever have a good feeling?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","You are as the Beneficent Emperor made you. Be content."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","How would we tell the difference?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Perhaps a moment... to catch my breath."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","There will be more to kill before long."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","You are truly made for war."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","In that regard at least I envy you, Slab."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","All proceeds according to His divine plan."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","At least one of us is happy, then."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","I prefer a cleansing flame myself."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","It matters not how the heretics perish, only that they die."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","Are you so eager for the Pyre?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","My faith keeps me warm. You should try it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","Throne help us. What were you like before?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Yield not to vainglory, Psyker. That way lies corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Your empty words mean nothing to me."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","How fortunate we are that the Psyker is here to advise us on the path of righteousness."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","I do not fear death in the Emperor's service."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","There are worse fates than death."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Concern yourself with the living, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Silence, unless you wish to join them."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","A worthy example for you to follow."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Strive for greatness, and perhaps your legend will exceed his."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","Courage, Pilgrim. We are at your side."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","All is as the Beneficent Emperor ordains."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","I will pretend I did not hear that."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","There is only a small step from treachery to heresy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Turn your strength to the task at hand."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","Then we must ensure our efforts are enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","Perhaps you should have brought more proper soldiers then."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","As long as you agree to follow my lead when it comes to matters of faith."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","I like them well enough. At the correct distance."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","They are a useful tool. Like you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Then we must make ourselves a bulwark against the flames."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Have courage, Pilgrim. All is according to the Beneficent Emperor's design."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","This is no dream, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Mouth is open, Psyker. Should be closed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","When the battle is done, we will toast victory together."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","This place would turn anyone to drink."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","He watches over us all, Templar."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","Well said, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","We will fight on regardless."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Have faith, Pilgrim. All is not yet lost."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","We must cut out this sickness before it spreads yet further."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","The enemy has much to answer for."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","We were not made for peace."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","There can be no peace while a single threat to humanity remains."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","We are all known to the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","Then we should ensure our lives are spent dearly."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Think of the suffering of the martyrs. That will give you strength."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Stop complaining!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","Fire is an instrument, like any other. Do not be blinded by its light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","True enough, in the right place."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Take a moment. Pray for guidance."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Killing, Slab. You're here for killing."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","Have a care, Psyker. Remember in whose company you stand."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","All is as the Beneficent Emperor ordained it. Have faith."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Perhaps the Inquisitor knows his work after all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","I am glad to fight at your side."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","When we run out of rations, I shall know who to blame."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Filling your belly cannot satisfy the needs of your soul."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","We will grant them the Emperor's mercy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","May the Beneficent Emperor spare us from such a fate."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","That might have saved a life. Instead it healed a scratch."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","A little more courage, Pilgrim? Surely that wound did not need tending."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","Perhaps you should spend more time in flagellation if that wound pained you so."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","A wound left untreated may easily fester."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","Best not to wait for the rot to set in."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor is family and home to us all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Perhaps you will see it again one day."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_a_01","Join me in a hymn, Pilgrims! [sung] ""My eyes have seen His glory.,.."" [trails off] Anyone?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_a_02","My soul swells with holy song! Who will join me?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_a_03","Bring out your hymnals, Pilgrims! Let us glorify him in song!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","When this mission is done, Guardian, we will raise a song to shake the heavens."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","There is a time for song, Guardian, but that time is not now."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","They will come in time. Gather your strength for now."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","[laughing] All things in good time, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","This battle is far from over."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Gather your strength, Slab. They will come soon enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Merciful throne."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Certainly. We shall hang on your every word."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","All the more reason to strive ardently for peace."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Perhaps those days of plenty will come again."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","[sigh] Beneficent Emperor. Why do you test me so?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Please. Not this again."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","All shall be judged!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","For the Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","Do not speak to me of Saint Messelina, Freak! Her holy name should burn your lips!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","The blessed saint! Long have I wished to rest my eyes on her gilded remains."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","You will have respect when you have earned it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","You make my flesh creep, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","So perish all who reject His light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Quite the cautionary tale."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","I see no problem with this."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Certainly. What could possibly go wrong?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","The idiot has a point."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","Can this device even bear the Ogryn's weight?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_a_01","A Pilgrim's duty is arduous, but your rewards shall be great."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_a_02","The Beneficent Emperor has not forgotten you, Pilgrims. He sees your service."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_a_03","You are weary, Pilgrims, I know, but your deeds are known to Him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","I am glad to bleed in His service."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","I shall be faithful unto death."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_a_01","Who will lead us in a prayer of thanksgiving?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_a_02","Give thanks to the Beneficent Emperor! Who will begin?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_a_03","Praise be to the Beneficent Emperor! Who will be first to offer their thanks?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","Praise be, he has shown us his favour!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","Beneficent Emperor, with all my heart I praise thee!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","There will be time for prayers when this is done."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Let us bow our heads in silent reverence."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Strength is not always measured in muscle, Slab."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","We are all as the Beneficent Emperor has made us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Be thankful for what you have."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Who will join me in a prayer of thanks? Anyone...?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","I assure you, I think nothing that I have not said to your face."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","Use your arts against the enemy, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","You were not made for wisdom, Slab."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","Blessed is the mind too small for doubt."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","May it rise from the flames."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","All will be according to His will."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","No rest for the wicked, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","To enjoy all the delights of this world? I think not."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","I have the very hymnal! Does anyone know  ""The Blessings of His Holy Scourge?"""
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","I will sing with you, Templar, when this is over."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Did we forget to bring the recaff again?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Perhaps a grox-prod is called for..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Then we shall give them a coward's death."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor has ordained their death. Cowardice will not save them."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","Death! Death to the enemies of the Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Come, Pilgrims! To Holy war!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Stealth is the coward's way."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","Ha. Battle is a hymn! It should be loud!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","Look to your own stench before you criticise that of others!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","Fill your nostrils with holy unguents, then no stench can bother you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Think of the holy destruction that we could wreak!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","With a flamer? Could we have a heavy flamer?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Aye, a beacon that tempts righteous souls to wickedness."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","I assume you have never been offworld, Psyker?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","A prayer group! I shall begin preparations immediately."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","I am glad to provide whatever spiritual guidance you require."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor sees all, and has sent us to judge them."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","Turn your mind to prayer, and you shall not fall."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Only the Emperor's judgement matters, and He sees your worth."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","You are where the Beneficent Emperor intends. Do his work."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","I would gladly trade for any holy artefacts you find."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","Waging holy war is expensive. We should offset those costs where we can."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","If you can trust no one else, trust in the Beneficent Emperor, and he will sustain you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","I wonder what dark event of your past so shattered your faith in your fellows."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","Watch as you please, Templar. I will gladly die before I break my oaths."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","I stand ready to scourge the oathbreaker and the unbeliever."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","We are only following your professional example."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","I am wounded to the quick."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Not while we have breath to serve."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor has commanded us to win or die."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Rest assured I will attend to the matter when we have a moment's peace."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","My weapon bears the marks of heavy use. Unlike some others I could mention."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_a_01","Who has a sin to confess? Come, Pilgrims, lighten your souls!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_a_02","We have a moment to shrive our souls. Unburden yourselves of your sins!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_a_03","Who amongst us is without sin? Speak of your failings, Pilgrims, and ask His forgiveness."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","I have pitied the heretic when I should have hated. Mercy must not temper our wrath."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","My sins are great. But his forgiveness is infinite, if we only serve."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Fear naught, for He is with us!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","In slaughter shall we praise him!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","Quiet, Guardian. You are making us look bad."
"loc_zealot_female_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","The Emperor grants you strength, despite your grievous wounds!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_01","The way is too dark to walk alone."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_02","Where are you going?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_03","Keep close. Danger awaits."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_04","We are safest together, Pilgrims."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_05","Do not stray from His light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_06","Do not leave the path He has ordained."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_07","We must stay together."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_08","Alone we will fail."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_09","Do not be distracted from the way."
"loc_zealot_female_c__come_back_to_squad_10","Return, at once!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","I pray that the Emperor in his wisdom sends his daughters to cleanse this place."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","Test me, God Emperor. I am ready."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","What is this ""Cicatrix Maledictum""? The very words are laced with corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","The greater the darkness, the greater the opportunity to bring His holy light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","I have never seen a place so much in need of cleansing fire."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","I should have liked to see this place in its new-built glory."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","The sinners here speak of a second hive city here on Atoma. As if one pit of sin was not enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","Destroy the abomination!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","The Beast must die! It must!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","It cannot guard against blows from behind!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","It is weaker in the back! Strike there!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","Indeed! You speak truth!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Of course! Let the abomination perish!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","I see the Explicator has dispensed with courtesy for the sake of brevity."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","I am tired of Explicator Zola's disrespect. We are all here to do the Emperor's bidding."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","I do not need honeyed words to recognise the Emperor's truth."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","I fear her pride may presage a fall."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","I shall reserve judgement. For now."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","Let her be judged according to her deeds."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","The Explicator once called this world home. That explains much."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","Explicator Zola has ties to this place. Whether that is blessing or curse remains to be seen."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Interesting. What other secrets does her past hold?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","And yet she speaks little of it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_01","We are in safe hands with our pilot. She is guided by the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_02","Faith guides our pilot. I am much comforted by this."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_03","Take comfort. Our pilot is a pious woman."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_04","Thank the Emperor. Our pilot is one of the faithful."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_01","Do you see? She shared with me this holy relic, the fingernail of Saint Andreikov of Velquis."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_02","She can be trusted. No heretic would carry the knucklebone of Saint Imogene the Bloody."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_03","She is true in faith. See, she gave me a copy of the Blessed Canticle of Saint Alicia's wrath!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_04","She is one of us, truly. See, she entrusted me with the holy ocule of Redemptor Carmillia!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Faith shines in unexpected places."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","We are lucky to have found such a faithful servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","What do you make of our pilot, Pilgrims?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I must confess, I have questions regarding the diligence of our pilot."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I shall watch her with care."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","I will reserve judgement... for now."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","We are all in the Beneficent Emperor's hands."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","We are safe in the Emperor's hands. Even if the Pilot seems...unpredictable."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","[sigh] Go on then. What is it?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Waste no more time, Psyker. Out with it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","[laughs] An impressive feat."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","[laughs] My opinion of her has risen."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","What troubles you, Pilgrim? Confession will ease your soul."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","Is it sin or sorrow that weighs on your soul, Pilgrim?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Gambling [Sigh] Take it as a learning experience."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Learn from the lesser sin, Pilgrim, lest you commit a greater one."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Fall abomination! You shall not pass!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","Beneficent Emperor! It will not die!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","The head! Aim for the head!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Smite the head! Scatter its feeble wits!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Hah! We shall best this foe yet!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Of course! I was about the suggest the same!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","It is good to remember the martyrs."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","Perhaps I should speak with him. Grief is a heavy burden."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","May he find solace in duty."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","May the Beneficent Emperor grant him peace."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","The sergeant is troubled today, and seeks to trouble us in turn."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","I see the sergeant is troubled today."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","The mantle of leadership weight heavily on his shoulders."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","The Emperor gives no one a burden they cannot bear."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","I will seek him out and offer him the comfort of faith. Once he is a little calmer, perhaps."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","I will pray for him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Tell me more of this Xanatros..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","What happened?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","Xenos horribilis. How did he survive such horrors?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","A feat to have survived such a war. Perhaps he had powerful allies even then."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","There was a Morrow fought at Armageddon, but surely it is not the same man."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow seems older than his years. I find myself wondering what sights his eyes have seen."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","It is not only faith that can sustain a body beyond its allotted span of years."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Perhaps an unnatural force sustains him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","May he fill his long years with righteous deeds."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Even a long life can be brought to a swift end. He is in the Emperor's hands."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","I do not know what to make of our Tech-Priest."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","The Tech-Priest seems strange, even for a member of the Cult of Mars."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","Can that body of cogs and pistons even be called human?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","She is a different kind of priest. One I do not understand."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","So long as she serves the Emperor, I care not for her eccentricities."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","She is strange, but I see no reason to mistrust her."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_01","Fear not, Pilgrims. The God Emperor demands our service, and will not find us lacking."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_02","A crusade awaits us, Pilgrims. Take courage, and know the worth of your deeds."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_03","All is as the Beneficent Emperor ordains. You are in his hands, Pilgrims."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_04","The Emperor has ordained the day and hour of our deaths, Pilgrims. If it is today, rejoice!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_01","There are no sins so great that a soul cannot be redeemed. Even yours, sinner."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_02","The Emperor knows your worth, even when you do not see it yourself."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_03","The time of judgement is at hand. Do not be found wanting."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_04","All is as it should be. He sees all and knows all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_01","Trust in the Beneficent Emperor, and He will deliver you!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_02","Courage, Pilgrims! All is according to the Beneficent Emperor's plan."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_03","Remember that you are the Beneficent Emperor's will made flesh."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_04","The Beneficent Emperor has not forsaken us, even now."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_01","The Emperor knows you, even those of you who are blind to him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_02","I will remember you to Him in my prayers."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_03","May you one day behold His radiance. Of course, you'll be dead by then."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_04","Pray diligently, and your faith shall only grow."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Remember, our truest prayers are found in action, not empty words."
"loc_zealot_female_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Forgive me, Guardian. Could you try again in simpler language?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__cover_me_01","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__cover_me_02","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__cover_me_05","Cover me, now!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__cover_me_07","Beneficent Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__cover_me_09","You have been given a weapon -- use it!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__cover_me_10","In His name, cover me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_01","I am... wounded..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_02","Have mercy on Your dying servant..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_03","I am called to judgement."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_04","The wound is deep."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_05","The light... is fading..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_06","Forgive me, I have failed you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_07","Beneficent Emperor, why have you forsaken me?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_08","I fear my journey is close to its end..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_09","Pray for me when I am gone..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__critical_health_10","The pain... the pain..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_zealot_female_c__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_zealot_female_c__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Help me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","It is upon me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","The beast has me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","It's biting me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_06","It has me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_07","Kill the thrice-damned thing!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_08","Kill it!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","The beast! Kill it!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","Get it off me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_01","I am held fast!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_02","I cannot move!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_03","Free me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_04","Beneficent Emperor, free your servant!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_05","Set me free!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_06","Why are you waiting? Free me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_07","What is keeping you? Free me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_08","Set me loose!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_09","Free me!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__disabled_by_enemy_10","I cannot fight like this!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_01","The Rager lies slain!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_02","So perish all who choose Fury over Faith!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_03","Another Rager sent to hel!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_04","The Rager is cleansed!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_05","Another Rager dead!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_06","Behold, another slain Rager!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_07","Your Rage was not enough!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_08","Face judgement, Rager!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_09","Die, Rager!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_10","The Rager is delivered to judgement."
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_01_d_01","Indeed! Many are the paths to damnation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_05_c_01","It is well known that heresy dulls the senses."
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_01","Die, beast!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_02","The Hound is destroyed!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_03","Face judgement, Hel Hound!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_04","Your fangs will snap no more, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_05","The beast is slain!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_06","Silence, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_07","Face your maker, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_08","Now you die, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_09","Die, Dog!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_10","Perish, Hound!"

"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_abhumans_two_a_03","Are the souls of abhumans as distorted as their bodies are?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_abhumans_two_a_04","A philosophical question: did the Emperor imbue abhumans with souls when he made them?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_abhumans_two_b_01","An interesting conundrum. They walk and talk, but are not made in the Emperor's holy image."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_abhumans_two_b_02","The Covenant of Saint Dalarik states that they are not soulless, but are possessed of lesser souls."

"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_01","I once knew a Chaplain with the Astra Militarum. He used to say he would rather enter the Eye of Terror than face another day with his regiment."

"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_03","Without the preachers who serve the Astra Militarum, surely the whole imperial army would fall to corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_04","As a child, I longed to serve as a Chaplain of the Astra Militarum, but I have since seen the error of my ways."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","A difficult calling indeed. A life of privation, endured for the Beneficent Emperor's sake."

"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","Unless the pay is truly excellent, I have no intention of volunteering myself."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Even the most recalcitrant grox can be led, given enough food and a heavy stick. The same I believe is true of Guardsmen."

"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_one_b_01","Her duty is a shackle about her neck. She will learn to bear it, or it will break her."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_one_b_02","This way of life seems strange to her. I trust she will learn, and swiftly."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_one_c_01","I will pray for her."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_one_c_02","Another of our companions who would benefit from the touch of the scourge."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_three_b_01","She bears a heavy responsibility. Or is it guilt?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_three_b_02","Brahms is keeping secrets. A dangerous thing."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_three_c_01","We are stuck with her regardless. But tread carefully."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_three_c_02","I will pray for guidance, and for her soul's salvation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_a_01","I mistrust the Rogue Trader. As I would any who treat with Xenos."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_a_02","A lifetime trading with the foul Xenos has left a stain on Brahms."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_a_03","Brahms claims loyalty to the Imperium, but she has profited from trading with Xenos."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_a_04","Have a care around Brahms, Pilgrims. She has dealt with Xenos, and cannot be trusted."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_b_01","I agree, but speak carefully. Who knows if she can hear us?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Hush. This conversation might better be had in private."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_c_01","We are commanded to abhor the xenos with good reason."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Even if she has profited by these dealings, it is to her soul's detriment."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_four_b_01","They worship a plague daemon, and are punished for their blasphemy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_four_b_02","So the corruption of their flesh mirrors that of their souls.."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_four_c_01","Who would serve such a master? Only the truly damned."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_four_c_02","Servants of the Plague Lord. They serve the very antithesis of life and purity."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_one_b_01","There is but one God. Place your trust in him and be saved."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_one_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor is the one true God."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_one_c_01","These false Gods offer much, but deliver only damnation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_one_c_02","See what becomes of those who accept the gifts of the false gods. Madness and corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_three_b_01","Surely the Emperor would not allow such a place to exist."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_three_b_02","If it were real, no human mind could comprehend it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_three_c_01","A virtuous mind does not dwell on such things."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Think no more of such things. That way corruption lies."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_a_01","I have heard it whispered that even the Blessed Astartes can fall to Chaos. Surely it is not so?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_a_02","Do you think it is possible that the Enemy has Space Marines of its own?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_a_03","Surely the Blessed Adeptus Astartes are too pure to be tempted by the wiles of the enemy...?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_a_04","I have heard of warriors of Chaos, like Space Marines but foul and corrupted."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Even to think of such things would be heresy!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_b_02","If the Blessed Sons of the Emperor can fall, what hope remains for the rest of us?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Think no more on this. That way lies only corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_chaos_two_c_02","I recommend we never speak of this to the Inquisitors. In fact, best we do not speak at all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_four_b_01","The great scar that lights the sky over Cadia. An abomination, a tear in the nature of reality itself."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_four_b_02","It is a gateway between the Warp and our reality. It is exactly as bad as that sounds."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_four_c_01","The Eye of Terror was the doom of Cadia. If the Empire's finest can fall, what hope for us?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_four_c_02","No good can come of it. If only that eye might be closed for good, but how?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Be ever vigilant. Foulness hides in the most unexpected of places."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_one_b_02","That's what they want you to think."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_one_c_01","Keep your weapons close, and your scriptures closer."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_one_c_02","The enemies of the faithful are everywhere. Be on your guard."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_three_b_01","I would not let you suffer such a fate for long."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_three_b_02","It is only a matter of time before your true nature is revealed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_three_c_01","Remember, the ways of the enemy are subtle. Watch the Psyker always for signs of taint."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_three_c_02","Be vigilant, Pilgrims. Should the Psyker fall to chaos, your very souls may depend upon it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_a_01","Sometimes I wonder what hope there is for the future, if even the Lion's Gate is not safe from Daemonkind."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_a_02","Be like the Lion's Gate, Pilgrims. Though assailed by Daemons, it stood fast."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_a_03","These are the days that try our souls. That we should live to see the Lion's Gate assailed by Daemons!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_a_04","I have heard dark tidings, that Daemonkind assaulted the Lion's Gate itself!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor's light still shines. There is no force that can extinguish it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Praise be to the defenders of Holy Terra. Without them, all might have been lost."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_c_01","May those responsible know the full weight of the Emperor's judgement!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_daemons_two_c_02","I shall pray for those who fell in its defence. Blessed martyrs, every one of them."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","He is the Sacred Godhead given flesh, both God and Man entwined."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","When did you all become experts on the nature of the divine?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","He is  by his nature unknowable. Cease your speculation, and turn your mind to worship."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","The blessed sisters have better things to do than saving your miserable hide."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Whine louder, and surely they will come."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","If the Sisters arrive, we shall know things have gone badly wrong."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Perhaps if we fail the Sisters will be sent to cleanse all that remains."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Praise be to the Missionaria, bringers of the Beneficent Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","They should be commended most highly, for the fulfillment of their most sacred duty."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","""For every grox returned to the fold, the grox-herd rejoices. So the Emperor longs to see each world restored to his light."""
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","One day I hope to join the Missionaria and bear His word into the void."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","A worthy aim for which to strive, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Only the most virtuous of deeds would ever attract the attention of the Synod!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","The Synod holds both temporal and spiritual power. A mighty institution indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Let us proceed according to our duty, and perhaps recognition will follow."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","The mutant is one whose physical form bears the taint of the enemy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","Humanity is made in the Emperors image. Shun those who deviate from his Great Design."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","The mutant is the tool of the enemy, and is to be purged."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","The virtuous have nothing to fear. And yet I see fear in the Psyker's eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","Luckily the Inquisition do not look to Freaks for approval."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Such folly, to think that you know better than the Emperor's Holy Inquisition."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Better a thousand innocents should burn than a single heretic walk free."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_a_01","Suffer not the witch to live, so the scriptures tell us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_a_03","There are not enough pyres in the imperium to burn away all the wickedness of witches."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_a_04","Fear the witch, for they corrupt the virtuous by their very nature."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","They are weak-willed, conduits for the evil that lies in the Empyrean."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Their dark powers are a temptation, and few are able to resist."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","All must find the Black Ships, or the pyre."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","Pray for guidance, Pilgrims, that you may stand against the witch when the day comes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","The greatest armada the universe has ever seen!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","Hundreds of thousands of souls, committed to drive Chaos back from whence it came."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Perhaps this will be the last war? [beat] I think not."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","So many fleets scattered across space. How can they possibly be co-ordinated?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Such is the price of hubris."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","Nothing is eternal except the Emperor. The Cadians learned that to their cost."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","We should learn from their example, and embrace holy sacrifice."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","They fought as heroes, and fell as martyrs."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","Careful, Pilgrim. Power and corruption walk hand in hand."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Just what we needed. More psykers."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","But this age is also a time of miracles. The Emperor's eye is also upon us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","A time of witches, a time of miracles. These are the days that try our souls."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_01","What horrors watch us from beyond the Great Rift?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_02","I pray for those souls lost in the Imperium Nihilus. May the Emperor grant them mercy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_03","Half of the empire, plunged into darkness by the Great Rift. Imagine."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_04","The Empire is divided by the great rift, half in dark and half in light. We are fortunate to be spared."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","The Dark Imperium. Never was a place more aptly named."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","Who knows what terrible deeds took place during the Great Darkness..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","The Emperor sees all, even that which is hidden. The Imperium will yet be whole again."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Blood will be spilt 'ere the Imperium is made whole again."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Let them come. All shall be judged in time."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","A great work lies ahead of us, to winnow the righteous from the damned."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","Here lies the path to their redemption. I trust they are grateful."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","They have been granted a great opportunity: to die in service to the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","Grendyl is the Beneficent Emperor's right hand. Ask no more questions."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","No good can come of this line of questioning."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","This conversation veers close to heresy. Enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","The Emperor's Holy Inquisition is beyond reproach. And beyond questioning."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Question not the Inquisitor's ways."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","Would you prefer the Inquisitor was taking a personal interest in you?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","The Inquisitor has sent us here to serve. Do your duty, and that will be enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","Waste no more time in questions. Our duty is clear."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_01","We are honoured to serve such a beacon of faith as Inquisitor Grendyl."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_02","In times of doubt, look to the Inquisitor for guidance and you will be led aright."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_03","I am glad to serve such a faithful soul as Grendyl."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_04","All that I have seen tells me that Inquisitor Grendyl is above reproach."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","I agree. I have witnessed holiness in word and deed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor has given us a worthy leader."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Great is the mind too small for doubt. You would all do well to remember that."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","Trust in the Beneficent Emperor, and His anointed servant."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_four_b_01","Her words are not meant for you, Ogryn. Nor, in fact, for the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Make of it what you will, Ogryn. I would prefer a clear translation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Perhaps you would be good enough to interpret for the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_four_c_02","Listen to me, Slab: there is no possible... oh, never mind."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I mistrust any who distort their Emperor-Given flesh in such a manner."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_one_b_02","She is more machine than woman. I mislike this."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_one_c_01","The Emperor works in mysterious ways. As does the Cult of Mars."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_one_c_02","You need not like her, only respect her skill."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Know your place, Psyker. Which is outside our heads, in case that was not clear."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Lay a finger on my brain, Psyker, and I will have yours spattered across that wall."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_three_c_01","This psyker has been nothing but a distraction from our purpose."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_three_c_02","I counselled against bringing a freak from the start."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_a_01","How old can a Tech-priest live, do you think?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_a_02","The Tech-priest's implants are new, but her flesh seems withered."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_a_03","I wonder when the Tech-priest took her vows. I suspect she is ancient indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_a_04","Those augmetics have sustained the Tech-priest long beyond her allotted span of years."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_b_01","The sum of years are meaningless if not spent in righteous service."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_b_02","A thousand years to serve the God Emperor would not be enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_c_01","The Beneficent Emperor has ordained the hour of her death all the same."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hadron_two_c_02","She should take care that the wisdom of the years does not pave the way to heresy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","I would ask what happened to the last one first."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","Whatever shall we do without you?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Stay with us and I will put a good work in for you with the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Perhaps I will enquire as to the nature of this service for myself..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The Purser? The love of coin can be a great deceiver."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Ah yes, the Purser. Another troubled soul for this motley crew."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","She would rule this place by fear, if the interrogator would only let her."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","There is no love lost between her and Interrogator Rannick, I fear."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Alas, we find ourselves in a seller's market."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","I fear she would sell each of us if she thought she could turn a profit."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","The wicked never prosper in the end."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","While we are aboard the Mourningstar we must endure her ways."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_01","A word regarding the purser, Pilgrims. She is not to be trusted."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_02","I had not thought much of Hallowette, but what I saw this morning diminished my opinion of her yet more."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_03","The purser is a loose cannon, dangerous and unpredictable!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_04","How the Inquisitor tolerates that purser I have no idea!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","She is a pirate, nothing more."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Anyone would make a better purser than that one."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","It is only a matter of time before her wicked ways are punished, in this life or the next."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","Beneficent Emperor, smite her for her wickedness!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Those parasites who prey on honest working folk."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Those of high birth. Those who consider themselves about the law."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Pride comes before a fall. The high born would do well to remember that."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","All the wealth on Atoma cannot buy a soul's salvation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Gangers are wicked, true enough. But heretics are worse."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","They must be brought into the Emperor's light... Or into the fire."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Who is the true sinner? The one who steals, or the one who robs the worker of the fruits of their labour?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Poverty corrupts and diminishes the human soul. If Governors do not feed their people, they must be opposed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Then pray tell us what you would build in their place."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","I had no idea you were an architect as well as a freak."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Hive dweller or noble, all souls are equal in the Emperor's eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","To turn away from such suffering risks the damnation of millions."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_a_01","The manufactoria of Hive Tertium are vital, so I'm told."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_a_02","Hive Tertium's labourers pay a heavy price for the output of its manufactoria."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_a_03","Atoma's people slave away in its manufactoria. Suffering is holy, if it has purpose."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_a_04","Atoma's manufactoria are the jewel in its crown. A dark jewel, mined by unwilling hands."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","And yet if Atoma falls, the secret of forging Moebian steel will be lost forever."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","The Empire's armies hunger for steel, and must be fed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","The manufactoria must be secured, but we must not forget the faithful souls within."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","May the workers find comfort in their duty, and a swift end to their suffering."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Strive for greatness, Slab, and perhaps the Bell of Lost Souls will toll for you yet."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Heroes are forged in the crucible of war. I will listen for the Bell of Lost Souls when you fall."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_four_c_01","If this is your goal, then we must seek out yet greater peril!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_four_c_02","Have courage! Perhaps you may yet achieve martyrdom."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_one_b_01","To hang my eyes on Holy Terra... The very thought of it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_one_b_02","One day I will see the Golden Throne, even if not with mortal eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_one_c_01","I pray for Holy Terra, and for the salvation of Mankind."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_one_c_02","A virtuous life is pilgrimage enough for me."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_three_b_01","Those who do not tithe soon reap a bitter harvest."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_three_b_02","To leave the tithe unpaid benefits no one, least of all the common people."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_three_c_01","The Imperium is the sum of its parts. There is no place for those who take but do not give."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_three_c_02","The virtuous embrace a life of service to the Emperor with a glad heart."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_two_a_01","A million worlds, all beneath the Beneficent Emperor's glorious banner..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_two_a_03","Have you ever seen a clear night sky? A million worlds, held in the Emperor's gaze."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_two_b_01","And yet there is such darkness between worlds. We must be the bearers of His light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_two_c_01","We will rekindle Atoma's light in His holy name."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_imperium_two_c_02","We must wage Holy War until the galaxy knows His peace."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","The point of assassins is that you don't see them. Until it is too late."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","Better to embrace a venomous snake than an Assassin of the Ordo."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","To strike from the shadows is the coward's way."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","We can revisit this topic should an assassin present themself."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","Some say the world will end in holy fire."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Imagine. Every living soul extinguished in a single glorious firestorm."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","All is not yet lost. Atoma's salvation may yet be won."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Then we must not fail, for surely Atoma will pay the price if we do."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","You may be above Imperial Law, but the Emperor's eye is upon you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Then comport yourself as befits an agent of His Holy Inquisition."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","We may be above the law, but the Lex Imperialis must still be our guide."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","The Lex Imperialis must be obeyed, both in letter and in spirit."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_01","As a child, I always longed to join the Ordo Hereticus."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_02","What an honour to serve the Ordo Hereticus. Truly there is no higher calling."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_03","Did any of you ever imagine that you would one day serve the Ordo Hereticus?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_04","Ah, the Ordo Hereticus. What better way to serve the Beneficent Emperor?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","An honour indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","We are the hammer of his justice. The task for which I was made."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","Ours is a sacred duty indeed. Not even the highest born may escape our scrutiny."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","All are equal before the scourge and the flame."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","Only the Beneficent Emperor can truly understand. For the rest of us, faith must suffice."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","To understand its workings would only diminish its wonder."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","The Emperor's strength sustains us, and lights the darkness of the void."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","Without the Emperor upon the throne, humanity would be plunged into eternal night."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","It is said that on his deathbed he wept, for he knew others would unmake his works."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Some say he will return in the hour of the Imperium's greatest need."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","In these dark days, we have need of another Solar Macharius."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","I fear the Imperium of Man shall not see his like again."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","These are the ways of the Enemy, to tempt us from the path of virtue."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","What you speak is heresy. The Dark Age of Technology almost damned mankind beyond redemption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Look to your scriptures for guidance, not the sinful ways of the past."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","When the Emperor commands me I shall look to the past for wisdom, and not before."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_01","No matter how dark these times, the Age of Apostasy was darker still."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_02","We should speak of the Age of Apostasy, a cautionary tale against false piety and the vanities of the flesh."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_03","I often wonder what would have transpired had the Ecclesiarchy perished in the Age of Apostasy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_04","The Imperium has known dark times, but none so dark as the Age of Apostasy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","They say the very streets ran with blood, all on the orders of the traitor Vandire."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","May the Arch-Apostate Vandire suffer a thousand torments."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Without Sebastian Thor and the daughters of the Emperor we should still be in darkness."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Praise be to Sister Alicia Dominica, who took the traitor's head from his shoulders."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_four_b_01","Loyalty is second amongst the virtues, after righteous hatred."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_four_b_02","His deeds have earned no great regard from me."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_four_c_01","Too many have hidden a heretic's heart behind a mask of servitude."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_four_c_02","If that loyalty were to falter, I fear what he might do next."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_one_b_01","Lord Melk, he styles himself, though I have seen no patent of nobility."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_one_b_02","Ah yes, the honourable ""Lord Melk."" There is little nobility to the man."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_one_c_01","I have seen his sort abuse the privileges of their rank all too often."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_one_c_02","True nobility is earned through service, not given by right of birth."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_three_b_01","And yet he clings to the trappings of his lost power."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_three_b_02","Still he thinks himself a cut above the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_three_c_01","He is the same as the rest of us. A lost soul in search of redemption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_three_c_02","He will come to learn that his birthright cannot save him now."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_a_01","Lord Melk has seen fit to correct my Gothic. My gothic!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_a_02","It seems Lord Melk considers himself my superior in the pronunciation of the scriptures!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_a_03","Lord Melk tells me that my sermon required more practice this morning! The audacity!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_a_04","According to Lord Melk, my Gothic is badly articulated. How dare he?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_b_01","Outrageous. The man knows nothing."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_b_02","You did well not to smite him where he stood!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_c_01","His babble is best ignored."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_melk_two_c_02","What would a disgraced scholar know of such things anyway?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_four_b_01","Surely not. Such a fate would have brought him to the pyre."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Nonsense. The inquisitor would never allow such taint within his retinue."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Careful, Pilgrims. It is unwise to speak lightly of such thing. Or, indeed speak at all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_four_c_02","I trust you have evidence for such outrageous claims."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Surely not. And yet I would not struggle to believe it..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_one_b_02","If that is true, I should like to hear his tales of righteous slaughter."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Someone should ask him. Slab, he likes you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_one_c_02","May his great deeds inspire us in turn."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_three_b_01","You are not fit to judge him, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_three_b_02","Silence, Freak. Your lips are not fit to speak the name of such a hero."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_three_c_01","His skills are beyond dispute. Regardless of the tales, he is a worthy ally."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_three_c_02","Cease this speculation. Following his example should be enough for you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_a_01","Pilgrims! I have learned that Morrow fought at the Battle of Macragge!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_a_02","Who would have believed that Morrow fought the xenos at Macragge!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_a_03","Morrow bears a holy relic of Macragge, entrusted to him by Chaplain Cassius himself!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_a_04","Sergeant Morrow is a hero indeed, a veteran of the first Tyrannic war!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Truly the Emperor has blessed him with long years if this is so."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_b_02","I will reserve judgement until I see evidence of this with my own eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_c_01","An inspiring story at least."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Has anyone asked him? No? Of course not."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_01","Truly the Mourningstar must strike fear into the hearts of our enemies."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_02","The hymns of the Mourningstar's laud-hailers are a blessed inspiration."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_03","How many years has the Mourningstar served the Emperor? What heroic deeds has it seen?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_04","Surely the Mourningstar is blessed by the Emperor himself."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Truly it was wrought by righteous hands."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","A shame that it must stoop to carry so many unworthy souls."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","May it bear us swiftly into the war to come."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Surely its machine spirit hungers for holy war."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Question not the Inquisitor's design."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Are you so keen to give up your share of holy slaughter?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Perhaps he will join us once we have proven our worth."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_four_c_02","It is a mark of trust that he sees fit to guide us from afar."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He is astute and calculating. Admirable traits."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_one_b_02","I admire his dedication."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_one_c_01","It is obvious he is content with our service. Otherwise we would be dead already."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_one_c_02","I am sworn to obey, and will do so without question."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_three_b_01","Do you suppose he seeks to follow in his master's footsteps?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_three_b_02","To rise in the Holy Inquisition is a considerable aim."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_three_c_01","Such a man would benefit from a spiritual guide. I will offer him my aid."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_three_c_02","Perhaps I should ask him for career advice..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_a_01","I suspect Interrogator Rannick of straying from the path of true faith."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_a_02","The Interrogator seems... less than faithful of late."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_a_03","Rannick's lack of faith stands in stark contrast to our pious Inquisitor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_a_04","Interrogator Rannick's piety leaves much to be wished for."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Strange, that so well connected a man should be so lacking in faith."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Now that you mention it, I do not believe I have heard him utter a word of prayer."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_c_01","If he strays from the path of faith, I fear he will take us with him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_rannick_two_c_02","We must show obedience: but watch him with care."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_servitors_one_b_01","The flesh still serves, even when the mind is long gone."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_servitors_one_b_02","What thoughts are held within those rotting skulls?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_servitors_one_c_01","Perhaps you will be honoured with such service. I would prefer a cleaner death."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_servitors_one_c_02","They serve, but I must confess my unease. Those blank faces and dead eyes..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Such rites are beyond the comprehension of mortal minds."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","They are angels, made in the Beneficent Emperor's holy image."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","The Adeptus Astartes are to us as we are to the lowest beast of the field."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","The Emperor's Holy Angels have more important places to be than this!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","A thunder hammer is not required to drive in a nail. We are sufficient for this task."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","This place would not long withstand the fury of the Space Wolves."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","Imagine the Raven Guard, swooping to cleanse Atoma on night-black wings."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","He is risen, as the prophecies foretold."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","First the Blessed Son returns. Soon, the father will follow."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","I pray that one day I may cast my unworthy eyes upon him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","The son of the God-Emperor walks amongst us. To live in such times is a blessing indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_01","Have any of you read the Codex Astartes?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_02","I have heard that there is a copy of the Codex Astartes on board the Mourningstar!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_03","Guilliman's Codex Astartes is a mighty tome indeed!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_04","Truly the Emperor guided the Blessed Guilliman's hand when he penned the Codex Astartes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","A divinely inspired volume indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","I dearly wish to read it myself, and to reflect on the spiritual truths contained within."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","The Blessed Roboute teaches humility, service and faith. You should follow his example."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Even the Blessed Primarch knows the worth of humility. You all have no excuse."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_surgeon_four_c_01","Have you really nothing better to discuss?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","Radiant and glorious, as the blessed scriptures depict."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","A shining beacon of light and majesty. Have you not read your prayer-book?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Conduct your life in virtue, and the sight of his visage will be your heavenly reward."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","None of us may comprehend him in his full glory, at least, not while we draw breath."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","Listen, and you will hear his words."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","The righteous know His will without need of words."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","Through the High Lords of Terra is His will made manifest."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","The High Lords of Terra learn his will through signs and portents."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Better a swift and holy death than to endure the temptations of the enemy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","What would you prefer? That the galaxy endure eternal darkness?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","No sacrifice is too small to go unmarked. Their martyrdom is a holy thing."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","I pray for the souls of the lost, and honour their sacrifice."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_01","The Beneficent Emperor was martyred for our sake. So we must follow His example!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_02","The Emperor sits in agony upon the Golden Throne. How can you fail to answer his call?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_03","The Emperor gave His all for humanity. We must not fail him."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_04","Our sacrifices are paltry compared to those of the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","An act of surpassing love, to immure himself in the Golden Throne for all time."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","Think of his agonies, all endured willingly for our sake."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","Honour him with your deeds, Pilgrims. He asks only that of you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","When he rises at last, he will know the faithful."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","It is best not to think too deeply about such things."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Great is the mind too small for doubt. These matters are best left unconsidered."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Must we continue? This is a matter for Enginseers and explorators, not virtuous souls."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","It matters not how it is done, only that the Mourningstar keeps us safe from the tempest."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","I would question any who do not approach the Warp with fear and dread."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","The Warp is an unclean place. You are wise to fear it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","I find the mortification of the flesh the best defence against the trials of the Warp."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","I recommend self-flagellation during warp transits. Pain clarifies the mind."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Time may ebb and flow, but the Beneficent Emperor keeps careful count of years and deeds."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Time is an illusion in any case. Remember how slowly it passes when we are under fire."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","Warp travel is a necessity. I endure it only under sufferance."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","To enter the Warp is to court damnation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_01","I do not care to voyage through the Immaterium. I was watched, I am sure of it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_02","There are unholy creatures lurking in the Warp."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_03","The Warp is the domain of blasphemous ... things."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_04","I fear the denizens of the Warp have left their unspeakable mark upon the Mourningstar..."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","Warp Entities. Such a bland description for such unspeakable horrors."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","An unclean place, and those who reside within are filthier still."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Enough of this! To dwell too long on the Warp courts damnation."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","I have heard enough. Turn your minds to virtue and service, not filth and corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Careful, Slab. Sefoni may not be as she seems."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Less time in training and more in prayer would serve you better."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","Do not trust her. She may have dark plans for us all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","I will watch you carefully, Ogryn, in case she has corrupted you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","Trust your instincts. There is something unclean about her."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","If she is to be a weapon in the Emperor's service, I would not be the hand to wield her."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","Careful. You may learn more from the witch than you bargained for."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Learn all you can from the Psyker. One day that knowledge may stand you in good stead."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","I find her unsettling. Troublingly so."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","So are the weak of mind corrupted."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Have a care. The unclean corrupt with their very touch."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Another psyker. Exactly what this mission needs."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_01","I wish to learn nothing that Sefoni can teach."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_02","Why have we been given a psyker to oversee our training? I can think of a dozen more worthy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_03","How is a psyker a suitable tutor for the likes of us?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_04","I am horrified that the Inquisitor thinks Sefoni a suitable tutor for us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","She makes my flesh creep."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","The scriptures say ""harken not to the witch."""
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","There is little that can be done for now. But consider me displeased."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","I shall have words with the Interrogator over this."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Emperor deliver us from reckless pilots."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","The landing can never come soon enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","You do not understand, any of you!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","Silence! I tire of your foolishness!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_war_end_b_01","The war will end one day, Slab, even if we do not live to see it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_war_end_b_02","If we are true of purpose, our victory is assured."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_war_end_c_01","Waste no thought on the future. To fight today is enough."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_war_end_c_02","Only ask yourself, what evil can you destroy today? Then destroy it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Pray for purity that you may be spared such an ordeal."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Only the weak could fall to such corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_four_c_01","There's is a taint which must be purged with fire and the sword."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_four_c_02","These wretched hives of corruption must be dragged shrieking into the light of truth."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_one_b_01","The wickedness of humanity is sufficient challenge for one lifetime."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Once humanity has been cleansed of sin, then I will turn my mind to the xenos."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_one_c_01","Ignorance is the best defence against the xenos."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_one_c_02","There may be a thousand xenos races, but cleansing fire takes care of them all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_three_b_01","Those who truck with the xenos imperil their very souls."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_three_b_02","The Inquisition may choose to do so. I would not."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_three_c_01","The xenos cannot be trusted. No good will come of it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_three_c_02","They are soulless abominations. Only damnation awaits those who truck with them."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_a_01","I have heard that the perfidious Aeldari worship false gods in place of the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_a_02","The Aeldari are abominations. They worship false idols, and render sacrifice unto them!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_a_03","They say the Aeldari worship fragments of cunningly wrought bone. Idolators."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_a_04","I once heard that the Aeldari worship many Gods, all of them at war with each other."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_b_01","They may look human, but they are soulless abominations."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_b_02","Tricksters and deceivers. Death is their just reward."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_c_01","The Aeldari have paid the price for the hubris of their forebears."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_xenos_two_c_02","No good can come of a species so deeply steeped in sorcery."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_four_b_01","Her deeds speak for themselves."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_four_b_02","Sister Zola is an asset to our cause."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_four_c_01","You would do well to emulate her."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_four_c_02","We could use more like her amongst our number."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_one_b_01","Her mind is fixed on a higher purpose."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_one_b_02","Yes, not everyone wastes their time in idle chatter."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_one_c_01","She will be judged by her deeds. So will we all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_one_c_02","She will be tested, yes, but I do not believe she will fail us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_three_b_01","I care little for a psyker's judgement."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_three_b_02","Let only the sinless cast stones."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_three_c_01","I will make my own judgement without need of yours."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_three_c_02","We all have doubts and fears. She has made a weapon of her weaknesses."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_a_01","Explicator Zola is a pious soul. You would do well to learn from her faith."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_a_02","I have not seen such a faith as Sister Zola's in some time. I am impressed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_a_03","If your faith is lacking, look to Sister Zola to guide you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_a_04","I have passed judgement on the Explicator. [beat]. A righteous soul."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_b_01","I agree. A worthy ally."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_b_02","I do not doubt it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_c_01","You would do well to cleanse your own soul before thinking of others."
"loc_zealot_female_c__lore_zola_two_c_02","There are sinners enough for you to judge. Concern yourself less with the righteous."
"loc_zealot_female_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","I have it!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Help me [grunt] bear this burden."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_alarm_01","Find the alarm pilgrims!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_alarm_02","We must silence that damned alarm!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","We cannot proceed. The way is closed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","I fear we cannot prevail against that door."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","The Imperium is its history. Such places as this are holy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","This is a shrine to humanity's achievement. Glorious."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","I shall bring all traitors to judgement. You need only point the way."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Judgement is my calling. I shall gladly seek these traitors."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","A proud structure. May it ever remain so."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Is it not glorious that this place yet stands?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","Alas that we must always take the most unpleasant road."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","[Disgusted Noise] I will never be clean again."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Let us put that train to holy work!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Beneficent Emperor, we give you praise for the gift of this vehicle!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Of course. Because taking the train would be too easy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Very well. Come, footsore pilgrims, our road is not yet over."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","How did a Tech-Priest such as you find your way to an inquisitorial retinue?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Tell us, Tech-Priest, how did you come to serve the Emperor in such a manner?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","The truth will find you, Tech-Priest, no matter how carefully you hide."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Half-truths and obfuscations. I should have known."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","If we are not supported soon, our martyrdom is at hand."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Where is the support team? Why are we forsaken?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","I trust there will be something left of us for them to support."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","You forgot to send them on time, didn't you?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","They toil ardently in the Emperor's name."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","Beneficent Emperor, reward these faithful servants for their toil"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Beneficent Emperor, why hast thou forsaken us?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","You have led us awry."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_something_big_01","What fell beast could have made such a hole?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_something_big_02","What horror could have caused such destruction"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Soldiers! Why do they stand idle when there is work to be done?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","These soldiers are a disgrace to their uniforms."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","The Water Cartel is no more. So perish all who turn from the Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","I shall not grieve for the Water Cartel. Heretics and wastrels all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","The Beneficent Emperor has passed judgement."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","A fitting fate."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The heretics consumed the Water Cartel like a weevil eating rotten meat."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The Water Cartel must have grown weak in their corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Greed has been the downfall of many."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Power unearned is a swift route to corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","If you ever wish to share a tale of your past, Sister, I am listening."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","How did a soul such as yours come to serve the Inquisition, Sister Zola?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","As you prefer."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","The Emperor sees all, knows all. [pointedly] Judges all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_insignia_01","The Cartels. So do the powerful prey on the weak."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_insignia_02","The Enforcers should have stamped out these Cartels long ago."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","Beneficent Emperor, grant comfort to these suffering souls."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","What a life... to sift through human waste for sustenance."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","This place is rotten with corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","Who could live in a place such as this?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","See how evil turns upon evil?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","If we leave them long enough, perhaps the heretics will wipe each other out."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_shanty_01","Look at this place. Such suffering. Such sin."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_shanty_02","This place has been sorely neglected."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_water_course_01","Have a care, Pilgrims. A slip here will mean your doom."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cartel_water_course_02","That water... see how it roils with corruption."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","The elevator comes! In the meantime, judge all who approach!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Pilgrims! We make our stand here until the elevator arrives!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","I do not accept that this comms-plex will serve better than the Mourningstar."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","There is deceit in this mission, pilgrims. A hidden agenda."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","What value is there in striving, if it goes unchallenged?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Then I am grateful to be in more honest company."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","I would be very interested to hear who this transmission is for."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","I trust the recipient of this transmission is a good, loyal servant."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Secrets everywhere. I shall uncover them. Depend upon it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","A seeker of truth cannot be stalled by silence. Be sure of that."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","This message is important, of course. But is it vital?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","This message is crucial to war?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Acceptable. A worthy mission."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","The explanation will serve ... imprecise though it is."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","I distrust the veil of secrecy pervading this mission."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Secrecy is often necessary, but can prove destructive."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_way_in_01","This is no means of ingress for the faithful."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_complex_way_in_02","A judge such as I should enter via the processional ... not this."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","What desolation. The sacrosanct rendered profane."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","How can mortal hands repair such devastation?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","What did the Tech-Priest say?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Sorry. Could you repeat that?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","What is a manufactorum without its labourers? A body without a soul."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The manufactorum stands, but I fear we are too late for the workers."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","More sorrow and suffering. [sigh]. One day there will come a reckoning."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","And where are the Lords of Atoma, to pay the price for their Heresy?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","How can one manufactorum be of such importance?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","What was made here, that this place should matter so to Rannick?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Then this shall be our sacred duty."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","I will gladly bleed to armour the soldiers of the Imperium."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_heat_01","This accursed place is as hot as the pyre!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_heat_02","May this heat [gasp] cleanse our souls."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Can our work here truly be done?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_leaving_02","Sufficient unto the day is the deed. Time for us to leave. "
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Mind your step, Pilgrims. To stumble here is to fall."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","We stand on the edge of a precipice - literally, as well as spiritually."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Onward! To the Coolant Control chamber!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","This heat cannot endure forever. To the Coolant chamber!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Leman Russ tank plating."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Parts of a Leman Russ. Named for an angel of the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","A poor life, to spend every moment in such a place."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","The workers sleep here, while their masters drowse on feather beds. Despicable."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_deception_01","Deceive the heretics? If we must."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_deception_02","This deception is distasteful to me."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","Here is a place where righteous justice was enacted."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","It grieves me to see such a place of judgement cast low."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","The enforcers have failed this place."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Where are the enforcers?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","These failed enforcers must be punished for their crimes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Such failure is unforgivable."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Tell us, explicator, did you grow up in one of these Blocks?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","I see you know this place, explicator?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I am here when you are ready to confess your sins."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Then use what you learned in the cause of atonement."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","An arch-heretic? Hiding in a prison? Contemptible."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","A jail is a fitting place for the arch-heretic."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","That does not look stable. Or safe in any way."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Some questionable decisions were made in this hab's construction."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","The Governor of this planet has failed their people."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","How could the Governor of this planet permit such decay?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","What a smell. This air is barely breathable."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","That stench! Holy throne."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","What unsanctioned goods were traded here, I wonder?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","This was not a place of virtuous trade, I will wager."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Careful where you step, pilgrim. This is treacherous ground."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","This place is slipping into Hel one degree at a time."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_alive_01","The smelter burns with holy fire!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_alive_02","The smelter is revived!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","What holy duty must these tanks undertake?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","These tanks. How have they earned such regard?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","A sacred duty indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","May they be put to good use against the enemy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Tell me, Tech-Priest, how came you to be here?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","The Tech-Priest keeps her own counsel, I see."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Perhaps you will come to tell us more in time."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","The Emperor knows your secrets, even if we do not."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","This place yet stands, a bastion of faith."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Why have the heretics allowed this place to stand?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Better, then, that we should destroy it ourselves,"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","We must not allow that fate to befall it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","The smelter is our goal. Quickly!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","We must find the smelter, and with all haste."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Are you so eager to burn? Move!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_hellhole_02","Pilgrims! We leave, lest the fire consume us!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Nothing lives here - no human soul nor machine spirit."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_lifeless_02","This place is a barren sepulchre."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","There - the main gate! Forward!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","The gates are open -- forward!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Here there is no time for thought nor prayer. Only labour."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_propaganda_02","If the workers had been granted time for prayer, this place might yet stand."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Stand fast, Pilgrims. Trust in the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Hold! Hold! In the Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","This place [cough]. How can anyone breathe such air?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Merciful Emperor. Did anyone pack a respirator?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","What secrets does this place hold, that Rannick wants them so?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Another day, another ruin of key strategic importance."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_hack_01","The machine spirit will yield its secrets."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_hack_02","We will have the truth from this machine spirit."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","This place is badly in need of cleansing flame."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_02","This place has passed beyond the Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","What helish infestation is this?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Throne. [beat] Look at this godless place."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","A daemon? You didn't think that was worth a mention?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Why am I not surprised?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","What fell deeds invited the daemon into this world?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","What summoned the daemon here?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Throne damn them all."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","May they all receive their just reward."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Let us hope the daemonic matter can only be found here."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","I trust the daemonic infestation is contained?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","To the Warp with it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Let us be the instrument of its destruction!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Pilgrims, we should take the stairs."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_02","That elevator is badly in need of cleansing."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","""If thy ears should bring tidings of chaos, best pierce thine own eardrums."" So the scripture says."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","A tainted vox-broadcast. Only with prayer and faith can such temptation be overcome."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Careful, pilgrims. Slip, and Hel itself awaits you."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Watch your step. Falter here and we fall in more ways than one."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Through hardship we are tested. My legs test me even now."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The path of virtue is long and arduous. I need a bowl of tanna."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Breathe deeply, pilgrims. Do you taste that, in the air? [beat] No? [beat] Exactly."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","It does the soul good to breathe such sweet air."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_view_a_01","Beneficent Emperor, we give thanks for this glorious sight."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Drink deep of this vista, pilgrims. The God-Emperor's works are mighty."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","This was a trap!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","We have fallen for a trap!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_03","What? ... What is this?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_a_04","That is not good!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_01","I cannot raise the Mourningstar!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_02","Strategium? Can you hear me? ... No good."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_03","The Mourningstar has gone silent!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","The vox has failed. We are alone!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","No matter! Fight on!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_02","Beneficent Emperor stand with us!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_03","Whatever comes next, we hold! "
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_raid_trapped_c_04","Fight! Make every blow an offering of blood!"

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","Time for righteous slaughter!"

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","Take courage, pilgrims. It is time for righteous slaughter!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","We would fight better if we knew the nature of what we face."

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","They are blinded by their sin. We shall strike from shadow!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","It matters only that the heretics fall."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","It is time for holy vengeance."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","All of this could have been done at Chasm Terminus!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Would a station not be a better place from which to redirect a train?"

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Easier for you, you mean."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","These soldiers could use a rousing sermon to rekindle their faith."

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Look - fighting! To the south!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_station_the_bridge_02","Turn your eyes to the south. The war goes on."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","Another hab unit fallen into Heresy."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Such misery in this place. Who can be surprised the enemy has made it their own?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A daemon in this place. I do not feel ready to face such a foe."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Courage, pilgrims. If there is a daemon here, our greatest test is yet to come."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Courage! Faith shall sustain us!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","We must not fail, or all shall be lost."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","We must retake the Torrent. The Emperor wills it."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","We must uproot this heresy, and plant the seeds of virtue."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","When the guilty are purged, the innocent may yet be nurtured into virtue."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Heresy prospers when the virtuous avert their eyes."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","This place is far from the Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","This 'Torrent' is a Heretical place indeed."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","And who is there to speak for the common folk?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","With the right guidance this place might be returned to the light once again."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","A holo statue! See how his holy light shines!"

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","There is no path here."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","This gateway shall not help us."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","This place is rotten with corruption, inside and out."

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Behold the cleansing of the water. Truly this is holy work."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","As water is cleansed, so is the light of the Emperor a balm to the mortal soul."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","What would happen if that atmospheric shield were to fail?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","That atmospheric shield does not look... healthy."

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","These are not the tanks we seek. Onward!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","Empty as a heretics prayer. We must continue our search."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Let me guess. That's where we're going."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","There is no way that can possibly go wrong."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I wish we had taken the stairs."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","[yelps] Are we sure this elevator is safe?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Beneficent Emperor, grant me your mercy in this, the hour of my death."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Surely the Emperor would not bring us all this distance for us to perish in such a way?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Fire, bolter and the sword. Understood."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","We shall be the instrument of its cleansing!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","We have a daemon. Because of course we do."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","A daemon? Here? How is such a thing possible?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","We must cleanse it, no matter the cost."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","We shall slay it, in the Emperor's name."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Do we know how this... pathogen spreads?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","What are the symptoms of this... contagion? Does anyone else feel warm?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","I shall be glad to leave this place."

"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","What do you mean by 'pathogen'?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Pathogen'? That sounds like heresy to me."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","A corruption, I see. It will burn like all of its kind."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","We shall drive it from this place with our prayers!"
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","Another ruin. I am starting to think nothing of this planet is standing."
"loc_zealot_female_c__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","Surely there can be nothing on Atoma worth saving. Look around you!"

"loc_zealot_female_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_01","To worship decay is to abandon all reason."
"loc_zealot_female_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_a_02","Decay, disease, pestilence. These are the idols of the insane."
"loc_zealot_female_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_01","Foolishness, but then what heresy is not?"
"loc_zealot_female_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_one_c_02","Those who stray from the light are often unfathomable in their reasoning."
"loc_zealot_female_c__nurgle_circumstance_conversation_three_a_01","The heretics sometimes mutter of ""Nurgle"". I have heard this name before."

"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_holy_tome_b_01","Verily. We cannot permit Atoma's anarchy to devour holy scripture as it has so many of the faithful."

"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_interpreter_b_01","When I sayeth that, everyone regards me as they would a madman. But when thou expresseth the same sentiment--"

"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_language_b_01","I feareth it is not just the words that eludeth thee, but also their meaning."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_language_d_01","[Sigh] I can certainly make the attempt. But not in the thick of battle!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_lost_cause_b_01","Tis part of their delusion that they doth neither recognise a lost cause, nor the hopelessness of their own personal plight."

"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unconventional_a_01","Thy methods art unconventional, Templar, but effective all the same."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unconventional_c_01","Alas, scripture is less forgiving. I fear there art no ""grey areas"" when it cometh to matters of faith."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wrath_b_01","I hath much about which to be wrathful. The prevalence of shirkers, apostates and lickspittles high among them."

"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_arms_e_01","Indeed, the very highest."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_arms_g_01","I must regretfully decline."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_bearable_a_01","I confess, Freak, that thou sometimes prove useful."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_bearable_c_01","But only sometimes?"

"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_decree_b_01","Hate suggesteth personal investment. They art decreed abomination by the creed. Tis that simple."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_decree_d_01","Yes, that wouldst be a most simple thing, requiring only a journey to Terra, endless discussions, an audience with the senior cardinals of the Ecclesiarchy and a weighty burden of proof."
"loc_zealot_male_a__bonding_conversation_round_three_full_b_01","My strength is that of the Master of Mankind! He filleth me with vigour!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_c_gas_b_02","I feareth not this wretched fume, nor any who lurk within."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_a_01","Our purpose is oft-shrouded in mystery, but seldom so literally."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_gas_a_02","This is ridiculous! How art we supposed to see anything in this?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_a_01","A Hound is the most loyal of beasts. It saddens me to see so many corrupted."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_a_02","Depiseth not the Hounds, for it is wicked hands and torment that lead them astray."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_b_01","Nor I, if truth be known. Woe that it hath come to this!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_hunt_b_02","We art tested, Guardian. We shall prevail if our faith is equal to the task!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_gas_b_01","Thou cannot possibly knoweth that. Even now, we might be poisoned."

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_05_b_01","That the Master hath spared thee this long is perplexing."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_13_b_01","Witch, I swear thy insane blaspheming could test the patience of a blessed saint."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_17_b_01","I think thou art best tolerated at a distance."

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_02_b_01","Humanity thrives in darkness, so long as the Master's light is borne tightly."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_03_a_01","I shalt brook no defeatist talk. To entertain failure is to blaspheme against the Master."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_03_b_01","Doubt forms the path to damnation."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_04_a_01","Seeketh no reward but the Master's satisfaction!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_05_a_01","Riseth, imbeciles! Forget not that we art the hammer of the Master of Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_05_b_01","And faith is the anvil upon which we smasheth the heretic!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_06_a_01","Tis good that our commanders art harsh taskmasters. Leniency is weakness."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_07_a_01","Attempteth not to understand our foe. Understanding begets doubt; doubt begets heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_08_a_01","Success is measureth in blood. Ours, or the enemy's, it matters not."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_09_a_01","We bringeth the Master's justice. Tis joy to the righteous, and a terror to the heretic."

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_16_a_01","Vengeance is thy sword; hatred thy shield; loyalty thy armour!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_17_a_01","A pity we can die but once in service to the Master of Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_17_b_01","Fear not death, for the soul of the faithful never dies."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_18_a_01","Trust not to hope! Tis the first step on the road to disappointment."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_19_a_01","Thy path wouldst be simpler if thou remembereth the three tenets: faith, hate and ignorance!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_05_b_01","Better death in service to the Master than life in failure and doubt."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_13_b_01","Fear cometh from logical analysis. Conviction dismisseth logic!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_17_b_01","We bringeth them only destruction in the Master's name."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_19_b_01","The Master of Mankind is the light and the Way!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_16_b_01","Indeed. Without such heresy, our purpose would be not revealed."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_18_b_01","[Intoned prayer] Whisper His prayers with devotion, for they will save your soul."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_01","The Master is with us! Giveth thanks at all times!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_02","We are implements of holy wrath!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_03","Gird thy faith, imbeciles! The fight continues!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Heretics? Where art thou?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_05","Heretics? I shall smite thee!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Heretics? I am thy doom!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_07","We accomplish a most holy task this day!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_08","Strive always to do the Master's bidding, imbeciles!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_09","Press on! For the Master of Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_one_liner_10","We cannot be stopped! We are the righteous!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","They merely describeth thy brutish form in polite terms, though etiquette is wasted upon thee."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","It means thou art evolved from human stock, but are no more human than a common aurox."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","Precision is close kin to holiness, it is true."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","I striveth for efficiency in all endeavours."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","I fear that in thy haste, thou hast wasted many shots."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","Thou shouldst seeketh to control thine enthusiasm in combat."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","Cease thy hoarding of the ammunition!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","There are others among us who requireth ammunition!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Ammunition is the Master's gift to us all. Not just thee!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","The Master bade me claim it."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","You wouldst question my holy purpose?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Seek solace in prayer, Guardian."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","Tis righteous anger that fills thee. Embrace it!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Hast thou no faith in the Master's plan? We shalt endure."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","The Master shall see us through all hardships, should we deserve it."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","The Master made thee for a purpose. Thou shouldst not interfere with it."

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","So the Master spares you the burden of pain as well as thought?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","Thus far, it seems ... agreeable, no more."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","It might certainly be worse."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","Zeal, duty and purity are the only weapons thou needest. Employ them as thou wilt."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","Thy crude methods are of no concern to me, so long as thy duty is executed with sufficient zeal."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","Dost thou do anything other than complain?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","That chill, sinner, is the absence of faith."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","Competent thou may be, but thou shalt never earn my trust."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Indeed. Thou carry out the Master's work ... at least for now."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","And what would a Freak such as thee understand about the importance of faith?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","Freak! Blasphemer! Were it not for our holy mission I wouldst verily show you the fire of my faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","Death in service to the Master of Mankind is its own reward."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","Falter not in thy faith! Shirk not thy duty! Only in death does duty end!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Thou seeketh to unsettle me, but I shall stand firm!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","No one is impressed by your lies, Freak."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","Famous indeed, and his worth was measured in the lives of the true humans he didst preserve."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Perhaps thou shouldst learn from Deddog's example, Slab, and abandon thy surly indolence."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","Only if thou likewise sweareth to safeguard me!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","Dost thou think thyself the only vessel of the Master's purpose?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","Thou wouldst shirk holy duty? Why I am not surprised?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","Ingrate! Thou are called to higher things!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_a_01","I confess, it pains me that the Imperium hath not rallied to Atoma's defence."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_a_02","We ragtags alone are surely not the Imperium's sole plan for reclaiming this world?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_a_03","We shall strive, of course, but where are the true warriors? The spiritual guardians of the Master's realm?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Trust to the Master. All proceeds as he hath foreseen."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","Doth thy faith falter? Say it is not so, Guardian."

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","I confess that I agree with thee. Fire is a seemlier tool of extermination."

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Trust to thy wargear, but trust more in the Master of Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","The faithful stand betwixt Mankind and a thousand horrors too unspeakable to name."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","Ugh. I hath no patience to spare on thee."

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_a_02","A moment of repose. How better to fill it than with prayer?"

"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","There is nothing as wretched as a traitor, but mayhap thou look for them in the wrong place, Templar."
"loc_zealot_male_a__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Thy judgement is as nothing to me."

"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","Oh, to see a host of Adepta Sororitas descend upon this benighted world, the Emperor's light upon their saintly brows!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","So it is to be a trial of faith and fire? I welcome it."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","Everywhere, people keep muttering about the 'Cicatrix Maledictum'. I don't know what they're speaking of."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","Yes. It means we are in hel, charged with bringing the Emperor's light to those that have it not."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","Last night I dreamt of maggots burrowing beneath my skin and my flesh rotting on the bone. I fear it was a portent for this war."

"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","I was present at a heretic's... chastisement yesterday. Among his deserved agonies, he babbled of a second hive on Atoma. Did he speak truly?"

"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","She is true to the Master of the Mankind. What else matters?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","She appears to be a righteous soul, but so do many hidden heretics."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","So long as she serveth the Throne, I hath no quarrel."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","One may be loyal to the Throne, and not one's companions ... as I'm sure you knoweth."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Werest thou aware that Explicator Zola was born on Atoma?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","I'm not one to gossip, but I heard the explicator once lived on Atoma."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","And since when did the past matter more than the present?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Scandalous, I am certain ... No, wait. This is entirely trivial."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_01","It transpires our pilot is more devout than I believed."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_02","Our pilot is not the apostate I feared."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_03","Our pilot is surprisingly devout."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_01_04","Would you believe our pilot can actually be counted among the faithful?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Truly? I find that somewhat hard to entertain."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","Praise the Master of Mankind! ... Thou art ... certain?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_01","I assure you, no one is more surprised than I. She showed me a finger bone from Saint Sibelia!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_02","Such a revelation in this dark hour. Why, she gifted me a holy text penned by Redemptor Kyrinov himself!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_03","She discovered a blessed Fleur de Lys in the ruins of Carpenthia, and she found herself filled with faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_03_04","She even gifted me her most precious possession - a scrap of leather from Confessor Prenorious' Tome of Penance!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","How splendid. Tis enough to restore one's faith in base soldiery."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","These are such welcome tidings. A good omen for the future."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","Our pilot should show more respect."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I fear our pilot is not the pillar of faith these times require."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","She will find her punishment, if need be. As do all those who are lacking in ... ardour."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","Cleansing fire will find her, should she stray ... or prove unreliable."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Her afflictions are not my concern ... until they veer into heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","Better that our fates were not in her hands, I deem."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","I seldom believe anything thou has to say. It seems ... wise."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","I have asked thee not to talk to me, have I not?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","Then she is to be commended. Brunt has no manners. Like all Catachans."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Impressive. He is somewhat ... formidable."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","And why dost thou look so miserable this fine night?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","Cheer thyself, Templar. A night of righteous deeds beckons."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Gambling is an abhorrent practice."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","A gambler deserves nothing but disappointment."

"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Smite the Plague Ogryn's head! Drive its soul from its body!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Yes! Yes! A worthy strategy!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","I approve this holy course!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","It has never been healthy to dwell upon the fallen."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","He should not mourn the fallen. Either they were faithful and died in glory, or feckless and met a deserved end."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","The Master of Mankind will guide Morrow, as he does us all."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","He will find peace, so long as he does the Emperor's will."

"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","One of the lexmechanics claims Morrow fought in the Second War for Armageddon. He cannot be so old."

"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_zealot_three_03_01","Alas that thou doth not truly understand. I shalt pray for thee."
"loc_zealot_male_a__conversation_zealot_three_03_02","Thou misunderstandeth ... But I suppose I should expect no better from thee."

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Judgement of the heretical is the burden of the pious. Something you wouldst know little about!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","Even lawmakers are not beyond impure thought. That is why we must be on hand to judge them!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","It falleth to us to uphold the Lex Imperialis, and to do so we must be beyond reproach in thought and deed!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_inquisition_two_a_02","To be an acolyte of the Ordo Hereticus is surely the finest calling the righteous may receiveth!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Verily was the throne part of the Master's great plan - a sacrifice he accepted willingly, for the sake of the Imperium."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","It was once thought any psyker might power the throne, but it is not so... As Malcador the Sigillite found to his cost."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","Whatever the details of his many feats, Lord Solar Macharius was duly canonized. The Master recognised his greatness."

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_melk_three_c_02","Might I remind thee that Grendyl trusteth Lord Melk implicitly."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_melk_two_a_01","Sire Melk upbraided me for my use of Gothic speech. He claimed it was ... muddled."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_melk_two_a_02","That ... lackey ... Melk claimeth I doth merely ape the forms and structure of Gothic speech. Charlatan!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_melk_two_a_03","Melk claimeth I understandeth not the form of gothic speech. Really!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_melk_two_b_01","Preposterous! Methinks his loss of station hath made his manner most distemperate."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_melk_two_b_02","Verily doth Melk's manner groweth more vexatious with each passing day."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_melk_two_c_01","Melk wouldst know not valorous oratory if it striketh him in the visage!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Mayhap the inexplicable power of Warp travel hath taken Morrow far. But at what cost?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_morrow_one_b_02","If Morrow faced the Tyrant of Badab and lived, the heretics of Atoma shouldst prove a mere trifle."

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Verily it seems impossible, but tis said time behaves differently in the Empyrean."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_morrow_two_b_02","The Battle for Macragge was centuries ago… Mayhap he became lost in Warp space."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_morrow_two_c_01","Twould be miraculous if true… But the Master of Mankind has miracles to spare."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_morrow_two_c_02","If only mine own faith could'st sustain me so long."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_a_01","Praise the Mourningstar, for is it not a mighty cathedral of holy war?"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_a_04","Truly doth the Mourningstar bring righteous fury to the Master's enemies."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Thou art correct in thy summation, although the crew leaveth much to be desired."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","Majestic indeed, though its crew are barely fit to serveth the Master of Mankind."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","T'will do these reprobates good to see battle for a righteous cause at last."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Dark times lie ahead - this vessel shalt yet see war in the Master's name."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Thou art an ingrate! Tis not thy place to question orders, only to obey them."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_four_b_02","The Interrogator's strategy hath not yet led us false, even if it cometh to us from afar."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_four_c_01","To obey without question is righteous. To die in service is divine."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_four_c_02","The Interrogator commandeth us, as the Master commanded his legions in the Great Crusade!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_one_b_01","Wouldst though want a man of sentiment in such a position?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_one_b_02","Pah! A man in the Interrogator's position can ill afford sentimentality."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Thou shouldst doubt not the chosen of Grendyl, for he leadeth us to glory!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_one_c_02","To doubt an anointed agent of the Holy Ordo is to doubt the Master of Mankind himself!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_three_b_02","A man shouldst seeketh not advancement, for doth not ambition pave the road to corruption?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_three_c_01","Whilst the Interrogator's commitment cannot be questioned, what of his faith?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_three_c_02","Dedication to justice bringeth its own rewards, for is it not a joy to the righteous?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_a_01","I deem that Interrogator Rannick wears his faith lightly ... if at all."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_a_02","I hath noted of late that the Interrogator's faith appeareth… less than firm."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_a_03","Doth the Interrogator's faith seem lacklustre to thee? To me he lacketh sufficient zeal."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_a_04","I feareth Interrogator Rannick may'st not be as strong of faith as we assumed."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Thou may'st be right. I hath ne'er heard him so much as uttereth the daily litany."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Perhaps… I hath not seem him offer devotions, hath thee?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_c_01","Appearances may be deceptive… We shouldst have faith in Inquisitor Grendyl's judgment."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_rannick_two_c_02","Dark times lie ahead. The Interrogator shalt repent his secular ways before the end."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_servitors_one_b_01","Praise be, for through the Servitor doth the Master of Mankind enact His will."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_servitors_one_b_02","Ah, to serveth the Master for eternity, unencumbered by thought or sin."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_servitors_one_c_01","I understandeth little of the Servitors' nature, save that they toil without complaint or deviance."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_servitors_one_c_02","We can but all pray that we might serveth the Master of Mankind so diligently."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","They undergo sacred rites of modification, to maketh their bodies in the Master's own image!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","The geneseed of a blessed Space Marine is so valuable, their brethren would destroyeth words to protect it."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","The Adeptus Astartes are as close to the Master's image as can be. Their nature is inscrutable to mere mortals."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","Where is thy faith? We needeth not trouble the Adeptus Astartes on account of a few heretics!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","Ah, wouldst that I be so fortunate to see the Angels of Death with mine own eyes!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","A pity the Black Templars are not here. Their intolerance is a virtue that driveth me almost to envy!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","If our faith proveth insufficient, we could hope for no more pious allies than the Black Templars."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","Tis said he entered the Master's inner sanctum... That the Master communed with him!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","The people didst cry out for a sign! And lo, did the Master's own son returneth!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","I tell thee it is true. The Primarchs awaken, and they shalt paint the galaxy with the Master's light!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","Pity Guilliman's crusade extendeth not as far as Atoma. He would make short work of these heretics!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_a_01","Guilliman's Codex Astartes must surely rival the greatest holy texts of the Ecclesiarchy. A mighty tome!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_a_02","Has any text in the Imperium's glorious history had such influence as Guilliman's Codex Astartes?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_a_03","Dost thou think the importance of Guilliman's Codex Astartes shall ever be equalled?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_a_04","Truly art we blessed that Roboute Guilliman had the foresight to pen the Codex Astartes."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","Guilliman teacheth that we must be the barrier between what is known, and the unknowable."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","True, Guardian. Tis much more than a book of doctrine. Many important teachings are contained within."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","By reorganising the Space Marines, Guilliman ensured that none save the Master couldst wield ultimate power."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","The truth of the Codex is that none should succumb to hubris. All must remain faithful, and humble."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","The Master hath no form thou couldst imagine! He is a living idol of righteousness, who appeareth not to sinners."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","None can behold the glory of the Master, for he art a shining god of light, too bright to gaze upon!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Tis said the blessed Martyr might gaze upon the Master's face in death... What better motivation to die in His service!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","Turn not thy back on the power and beauty of the Master! Let His radiance fill thy heart!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","Thou art a knave to reduce the Master's divine message to mere utterance! Penance awaits thee!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","The Master of Mankind requireth not mere words. His will alone commandeth untold billions!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Warp-travel grants power to the mutants of the Navis Nobilite, and iconoclastic Enginseers. Sinners all!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","It is by the foul work of mutants that we enter the Warp, but by the will of the Master that we art kept safe."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","Fear not the shadow of the Warp, Templar, for the Master of Mankind doth watch over us!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_a_04","To receive training from a witch! Truly, this insult hath been sent to test us."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","I concureth. When our work is done, there mayeth yet be a reckoning for the freak."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","There is nothing for me to learn from such an abomination."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","The training wouldst surely be burdensome for one of weaker resolve."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","Her methods are insufferable! Shouldst I desire punishment I wouldst flagellate myself."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Though I cravest battle with the heretics, I wouldst prefereth to keep the contents of mine stomach…"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","For once, freak, I art inclined to agree…"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","Doth not the blessed Valkyrie delivereth us in one piece, that we might smite our enemies?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","It bringeth swift vengeance to the Master's foes... so long as we doth not perish on the journey."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_war_end_b_01","Though we may endeth the war against these heretics, we must ever be vigilant!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_war_end_b_02","This war? Mayhap yes, Brute, but there shalt always be more heretics to crush!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_war_end_c_01","As long as Mankind harbours vile heretics, there shalt be only war."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_war_end_c_02","Our battle against heresy shalt rage forever, a righteous flame 'gainst the darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Such an abomination wouldst surely be declareth Xenos Horrificus. It could not be suffered to live!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_four_b_02","We art made in the image of the Master of Mankind. Corruption of the human form art an abomination!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_four_c_01","There art all manner of foul xenos in the galaxy, and tis our sacred duty to destroy them!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_four_c_02","These ideas come from a sick mind! I must pray, and scourge away such unclean thoughts. I suggesteth you all do the same."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_one_b_01","Between the stars, the enemies of Mankind do wait and hunger. Pray thou dost not become their next meal."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_one_b_02","He who doth allow the alien to live shareth in the crime of its existence."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_one_c_01","I hath heard the thrice-cursed Aeldari are a race of witches entire. A blasphemy almost beyond imagining."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_one_c_02","Are not the Aeldari the most vile and insidious of all? Their so-called wisdom is but pretence; their power an illusion."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_three_b_01","The Ordo Xenos believeth in turning the weapon of the enemy against them. Tis a dangerous path to damnation!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_three_b_02","You wouldst have us dabble with the tainted knowledge of the vile alien? Sacrilege!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_three_c_01","I hath seen the so-called warbands of the Ordo Xenos. Ape-like creatures and gangrel Kroot working alongside humans. Tis a disgrace!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_three_c_02","They say the Jokaero art masters of strange technology, but does not that make mock of the Adeptus Mechanicus?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_a_01","Of all the xenos, be there any more accursed than the Aeldari, with their eldritch witchcraft and false gods?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_a_02","Are not the Aeldari the most vile of xenos? They present themselves as fair and wise, but dabble in dark forces beyond control."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_a_03","I have lately learned of a vile xenos called the Aeldari, who doth suffer witches and worship false idols!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_a_04","Let none suffer the heretic, lest they fall like the Aeldari, that thrice-cursed race of false prophets and cursed witches."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_b_01","Trust not their appearance. The Aeldari are as alien to the Master's faithful as the vile Tyranids, and their ways just as dangerous."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_b_02","The Aeldari art a race of witches. What dangers they pose in these dark times can only be guessed at."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_c_01","Perfidious Aeldari! Tis said they once held the stars in their grasp, and yet how they fell. They are worthy of nought but contempt!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_xenos_two_c_02","Pah! For all their mysticism and supposed intellect, they flee before the darkness like frightened children, whilst the Imperium fights on!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_four_b_01","Strength of arms is not everything, imbecile. Strength of will is worth tenfold more."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_four_b_02","Thou art a dullard. Thy opinion of the pious Sister Zola is of no consequence."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_four_c_01","I for one prefer Sister Zola's stoney façade to thine imbecilic chatter."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_four_c_02","She must possess faith indeed to transcend the dangerous knavery of Atoma."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_one_b_01","Sister Zola's solemnity is a credit to her."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_one_b_02","Serious matters require serious minds. Would that all were so focused."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_one_c_01","Unlike you imbeciles, Sister Zola alloweth not distraction to cloud her mind."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_one_c_02","Such mindless speculation is anathema to a dutiful servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_three_b_01","Sister Zola keepeth the gates of her mind locked and barred - mayhap tis wise 'gainst the likes of thee!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_three_b_02","She may keepeth secrets from her allies, but the Master of Mankind sees all."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_three_c_01","Let no doubt enter thine hearts, imbeciles. Doubt is a seed from which heresy grows."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_three_c_02","She hath thus far been nought but a dependable servant of the Master. Let that be an end to it."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_a_01","Sister Zola is a good and loyal servant of the Master. If only all were thus."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_a_02","Sister Zola showeth a sincerity sadly lacking in many of the Master's followers."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_a_03","Forsooth, it saddens me that more doth not follow Sister Zola's dutiful example."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_a_04","From her bearing I dare say the Explicator is a pious mistress. Unlike some..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_b_01","Thou need not speak to me of faith, for tis a resource I possess in abundance."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_b_02","We needeth more like her in these dark times, and fewer imbeciles."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_c_01","Where the righteous tread, the blessed follow."
"loc_zealot_male_a__lore_zola_two_c_02","If the Master hath seen fit to bless her, thou shouldst question her not."
"loc_zealot_male_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","I hath what we seeketh!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","I hath one! Aid me, so that I might deliver it!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_alarm_01","By the Master! Kill that alarm!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_alarm_02","They will keepeth coming whilst the alarm sound!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","It appeareth that our path is blocked."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","The doors art sealed! We hath no way to progress."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","Blessed Master, what a trove of knowledge this is!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Consider the knowledge buried in this holy place!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Alas for Tertium that she harbours traitors to her bosom. Where dost they cower?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Fie that filthy traitors are at work within Tertium's walls. Where will our search leadeth?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","I taketh solace in the longevity this place."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","This cathedral of knowledge is ... inspiring."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","This is not the approach one of my standing should endure ..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","The smell in here is really quite ... remarkable."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","The train, sinners! Why can we not put it to righteous purpose?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","The Master of Mankind has presented us with this train. Must we shirk His beneficence?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","The Master placeth temptation in easy reach. The righteous resist!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","On second thought, tis folly to depend upon faithless machines."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","So, Tech Priest, how did one of thy misguided faith end up on such a righteous mission?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","How came one such as thee to work for Grendyl, Tech Priest?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I trust not those who obfuscate their true intent with unnecessary words."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Thou wouldst prefer not to reveal thy sinful past in my presence? Wise."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Pray sinners! Pray that the support team hath not abandoned us!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","If the reinforcements arriveth not, it is down to thy sinful nature!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","We need them not! The Master of Mankind protects!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","Good, for in such sinful company as this, victory is far from assured."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","What greater reward than to toil with such purporse!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","Behold, sinners! Wouldst that thine own toil could be so industrious."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Where are we, sinners? Wouldst thou lead us to the very pits of damnation?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","The Master of Mankind shalt guide our way! Would've been easier with a map..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Some fell beast hath come from the dark, to feast upon the wicked..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_something_big_02","An abomination smote these defences, be wary!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Perhaps a sermon might rouse these lollygaggers to righteous zeal?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","What greater calling than to fight and die for the Master of Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","The Water Cartel have met an apt fate. One well-deserved."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","I shall shed no tears for the Water Cartel. The Imperium is better off without them."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","All is as the Master of Mankind has proclaimed. Thou shouldst take comfort in that."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","The Master of Mankind's will be done. All degenerates shall meet the cartel's fate."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","These cartel gangers were surely feeble reprobates to fall so swiftly to the heretics."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Had the Water Cartel paid proper devotion to the Master of Mankind, they would not have fallen so fast."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Vigilance shall ever be my watchword. As it should be thine."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Dost thou see how readily immorality becomes thy doom?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Sister Zola, thou hast done well to free thyself from this nest of villainy."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","The Master of Mankind surely stood with thee, Sister Zola, when thou didst escape this corroded nest."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Thou hast no secrets from the Master of Mankind."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","I shall pray for thee, explicator. Thou are surely in need of it."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_insignia_01","Spare no pity for the wastrels of the Water Cartel. They strayed from the Emperor's Light."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_insignia_02","The Water Cartel met a deserved fate. Criminals and heretics all!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","It is a holy existence in this place, relying only on what the Emperor provides."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","Poverty is an honest station. So few are deserving of better."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","Tis disheartening to see the Emperor's works in such decay."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","This place is a fit metaphor for the degradation of the human soul."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","Have these heretics nothing better to do than to quarrel with one another?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","See! The fruits of heresy! Distrust! Treachery! Death!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_shanty_01","I almost envy the humble, pious life one might find here … but for the smell."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_shanty_02","Squalor does not automatically equate to sinfulness … though I'm sure there is sin enough here."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_water_course_01","The river is as turgid and foul as thy souls!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cartel_water_course_02","Let us pray the bridge holds. I have no desire to swim in that."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Blessed Master! Speed thine elevator in our hour of need!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","We must hold until the elevator arrives!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","I still comprehendeth not why the Mourningstar cannot accomplish this transmission."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","The Mourningstar wouldst surely be a better choice than ... us?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","Blessed Master! Is nothing sacred?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Is not the holy Inquisition above such betrayal?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","I confess I am curious as to where this transmission is headed."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","To whom do we send this message?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Thou wouldst withhold secrets from the faithful? Typical."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","The Master of Mankind knows all. One day, so shalt I."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","Canst thou share nothing of the transmission contents?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","Wilst thou not tell us a little of what this transmission contains?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","I wouldst prefer it a rousing hymnal, recovered from the ruins ... but this is adequate."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","Better it were a litany of worthy souls, fallen with faith in this necessary struggle."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","I was not brought into this life to deliver ... messages."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","I am no courier. This mission lieth far beneath my station."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_way_in_01","Tarry not, for I hath discovered a way inside!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_complex_way_in_02","The Master of Mankind hath revealed the path!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","I deem the damage is extensive. Can this manufactorum be restored to holy function?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","A tragedy to see a holy forge so slighted. Can its harms be undone?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","I find thy words incomprehensible, and thine tone … ambiguous."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Thy reply was … perhaps not so informative as thou intended."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","Even if the manufactorum is saved, it will require new workers to replace the slain."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The manufactorum may yet be salvagable. Alas, the workers hath all been martyred."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Good. The Master of Mankind's work should not be delayed through mere idleness."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","It fills mine heart with joy that Atoma is so efficiently governed, even now."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","This manufactorum must be vital for Rannick to worry over its fate."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","This is but one manufactorum among many. Is it truly so vital?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Then we shall triumph this day! I decree it!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","It seems, sinners, we hath a necessary duty at hand! Give thine all!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_heat_01","The heat! It fair sucks the breath from mine lungs. But I shalt forge on!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_heat_02","Tis hot as Hel in this place. Fit environs for the extermination of heresy!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Like the blessed Saint Catharella, we rise out of hel!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_leaving_02","Our task is done, sinners!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","We hath a long way yet to go, sinners!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Consider this a pilgrimage, sinners! Offer prayer to the Master with every step!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Not far now, sinners! Keep thy pace until we reach Coolant Control."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","Feel the heat of thy  labours, sinners! It is as naught to the fires of damnation!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_production_line_01","The Leman Russ battle tank. Named for a great and faithful hero of old."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_production_line_02","The Leman Russ tank was named for a great hero. A true servant!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","Now this is the very essence of dedication, to dwell within the place of thy purpose!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","The workers sleep in their place of labour? Commendable!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_deception_01","It is fitting that we deceive the heretics. After all, they have already deceived themselves."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_deception_02","I see little point in our deception this day. The heretics are already blind."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","A symbol of the Imperium's justice, brought low by heretics."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","When our mission is done, we should restore this place in the Master's name."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Had the enforcers kept to their solemn duty, our intervention wouldst be unnecessary."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Did the enforcers fall to the heretics, I wonder? Or become heretics themselves?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Once our work is done, I pray for the return of the Master's justice to this benighted world."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","I pray we purge Atoma of heresy, so Imperial rule may'st return with holy vengeance!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Do I detect a familiarity with this place, explicator? A passing regret perhaps?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","What about you, explicator? Did your unsavoury past ever bring you hither?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","You say little, and yet speak volumes of a shameful history."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Guided toward an arch-heretic by a common criminal. Oh, the ignominy."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","The arch-heretic cowers in a jail cell, but the sentence is death!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","A final mockery of the Master's law that our quarry makes a home of a prison cell."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","Faith can support even the lowliest citizen. But structural integrity also helps…"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Better up there, even on unstable supports, than down here in the mire of corrosion."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","Even in such an unwholesome place, the ingenuity of the Master's servants is plain to see."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","Though it has fallen from holy function, this machinery is testament to mankind's ingenuity."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","Tis barely a fitting environ for the Master's faithful servants."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","If it is truly the Master's will that we travel this foul path, far be it for me to argue…"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","From the look of this place, it never thronged with the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","All manner of iniquitous exchanges once took place here, mark my words."

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_alive_02","By the Master's will, the smelter lives!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","All of the Master's battle tanks are sacred. Why single out these few?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Dost thou feel it, imbeciles? These battle-tanks surely have some holy purpose..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","And what is armour, if not the embodiment of our faith?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Armour protecteth embeciles such as thee, but faith is my shield."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","What about you, Tech-Priest? What wretched past doth thy mask hide?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Thou listeneth much but speaketh little, Tech-Priest. What of thy past?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Thy words are riddles, and thy faith is lacking."

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","This place yet stands, defiant in the face of the blasphemer!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The heretics' efforts to destroy this place are feeble as their wills."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","The heretics must not befoul the Master's blessed battle tanks!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","I'd see it burn rather than let it fall to the heretic."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Find the smelter! Tardiness is a path to heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Hast thou imbeciles forgotten our mission? To the smelter!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Stay here if thou seeketh fiery redemption... But I say we leave!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_hellhole_02","Another righteous duty fulfilled!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_lifeless_01","No one toils here now. Wouldst that we all meet our ends in the Master's service."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_lifeless_02","Where the Master's industry falls idle, heresy grows!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","The main gate is unprotected, like the mind of the heretic!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","We advance through the main door. Guile is the shield of the heretic."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_propaganda_01","In this place the faithful laboured, leaving no time for impure thought."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_propaganda_02","Heed these litanies, imbeciles, and thou might yet be saved."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Hold, imbeciles! That elevator is thine only chance of ascension..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Hold thy ground! The Master has use of thee yet!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","Tis like breathing hel-fire! A fitting environ for corruption to thrive."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Each acrid breath is the wage of thy fecklessness!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Is such a place really so important in the Master's design?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","This manufactorum must be of great import if the heretics desire it so."

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Where there is heresy, there is corruption most foul!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","In the Master's name, what is this blasphemous infestation?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Tis barely a surprise that the vilest of foes wouldst make a home in this pit."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Even had though told us, mine resolve wouldst not waver either way."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Is Sector Periferus so beyond redemption that daemons now materialise at will?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Dost thou know what blasphemous act birthed this monstrosity?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","For all the enemy's honeyed whispers, the reality is but a pox-ridden nightmare."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Weak-willed imbeciles! They know not what they have wrought."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Such pustulent corruption will not confine itself to just this building, mark my words."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","A daemon of this ilk will surely drip its heretical pox throughout Sector Periferus."

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","This abomination shalt not be suffered to live!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","These weak-minded imbeciles may'st be corrupted by mere words, but not I!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Those who turneth from the Master at a mere vox-broadcast are weak of will to begin with."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Better up here, closer to the Master's light, than down there in the depths of depravity."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Careful, imbeciles! I wouldst not plummet to my death e'er my righteous purpose is done."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","Why must we walk everywhere? The Master's retribution shouldst be swift, and violent."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Couldst not we achieve our holy purpose more quickly by air?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Breathe deep. Tis the last clean air afore we descend to the pits of iniquity."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_02","The air here seems thin to thine lungs, for it hath not yet been contaminated by heresy."

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_propaganda_view_a_02","Praise be to the Master of Mankind, for He creates beauty in the unlikeliest places."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_01","[Groan] What now?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_a_02","Sinners! We art sealed in!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_b_04","Wretched vox! Never working when tis needed!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_raid_trapped_c_01","We fight for the Master! For the Imperium!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Unforgiveable that its defenders allowed it to fall!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Shouldst the Master wish us to reclaim this place, we must see it done."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Thou knowest much about this pit of iniquity, Explicator. Too much."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Strange, Explicator, that thou art so familiar with this place."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","So thine work is thy penance?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","[Sigh] Must I have eyes in the back of my head in such company?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Special issue ammunition is no substitute for faith and steel... but it helps."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","The Master hath given us a bounty... Special-issue ammunition!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","What use is it anyway, when thine greatest foe is intangible?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","The Master giveth, and the Master taketh away..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_01","Quiet as the grave... this hab block is not the pit of corruption I expected."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_hab_block_dreyko_02","Strange... such a place usually teems with heretics!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_01","Heretics skulk in shadows. The Masters servants shouldst embraceth the light!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_start_banter_a_02","Subterfuge is the last resort of the faithless."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_trains_01","A train! The heretics hath pressed the Master's machinery to their fell purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_rails_trains_02","[Sigh] A marvel of Imperial engineering, now twisted by corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_01","Tis a pity these streets are empty of the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_boulevard_02","Dost the faithful cower in their homes when the Master needs them? Fie!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_01","Must we now wait for the bridge? Intolerable!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_hurry_up_02","[Sigh] Why is it not yet down?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_01","Martyrdom is forever our calling. Mayhap today?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridge_of_martyrs_b_02","I gladly walketh the path of the martyrs."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_01","[Sigh] Yet more manual labour ..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_bridges_up_b_02","I expect we hath little choice in the matter."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_01","Fight on, imbeciles! In the Master of Mankind's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_a_02","They know nothing of fear! Let us teacheth the base principles!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_01","I shall not yield! I shall not!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_defence_conversation_b_02","Worship the Master with thy slaughter!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_01","Lo! I weep to see the preacher's pulpit abandoned. Another martyr!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_a_02","Alas to be here in such wicked times, when even the street preachers flee their pulpits!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_01","Martyrdom is the very highest calling!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_pulpit_b_02","How bold can the heretics be when they fear mere words!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_01","Ah, we walketh faithful streets at last!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_resurgence_start_banter_a_02","The domain of the Master's faithful. Glorious."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_retrieve_01","Ignominy! For today I am a beast of burden!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_retrieve_02","The Master of Mankind didst not send me into the world to drag things from place to place!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scan_01","We are to perform a scan? Hah! What can a machine see that a righteous soul does not?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scan_02","I do not trust this scanning device. Machines reason without benefit of a soul, and thus have no faith."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_01","To walk within the Master of Mankind's light is a marvel you sinners do not deserve."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_daylight_02","Mine spirit soars to walketh in the light once more. It is a good omen for our mission."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","It grieves me to witness a once-noble edifice thus reduced in stature. How long has it been thus?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Would that this place could be restored to glory … But I suppose it has lain thus for many years."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","The Master of Mankind's works shall endure ten thousand lifetimes, so long as our faith remains true."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","It matters not. All shall be reclaimed, and the Master of Mankind's works restored. We can do no other."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","We must stop the heretics' contagion - whatever the cost!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Eradicating unholy plague from the Master of Mankind's realm is a most fitting task for us."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Their concoctions shall findeth no purchase on me, for I am protected by the Master of Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Heretical concoctions are naught to those whose strength arises out of faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","The skies are quiet, but I would wager it was not so in this sector's heyday."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","There is a strange peace to this place. But the past, I deem, was far noisier."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","The old days will return, if we strive to restore them."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","The glories of the past are never beyond reach of those whose faith is strong."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_interior_01","Pray thee, sinners, that the roof does not collapse on us!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_interior_02","The region stands upon the brink of collapse. Doubtless as divine retribution for the purpose to which it is put."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_01","See? The Master of Mankind's works endureth, even in the face of hardship!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_servitors_02","Praise be the Master, whose works endureth the ravages of time and heresy!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_01","The cargo elevator is in position. We may proceed."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_ship_elevator_end_02","The cargo elevator is in place. Onward, sinners! In the Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_01","This ruin is an infested, heretic-riddled warren! Wouldst that we could purge it with flame!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_scavenge_underhalls_02","I sense perfidious heretics upon all sides! They mock us with their presence!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_01","Time to slay the arch-heretic!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_one_b_02","At last, this heretic shalt face retribution!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_three_b_02","In the Master's name, this heretic shalt die!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Mayhap we hath underestimated this foe. What lieth in wait for us?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","What manner of heretic do we face?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","The Master hath presented thee a challenge. Rise to it, imbeciles!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","This evil may yet make martyrs of us all..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","A catechizer post... A pity the magistratum didst not root out all the heresy from this place."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_02","The Master gave His servants all the tools to detect the heretical... how did they fail?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","This seems a fruitless task for the righteous."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Whilst we tarry with these trains, the heretics surely prosper."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","We shalt shirk not our duty... If tis truly the Master's will."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","Look thee to thine orders - I shalt pray to the Master of Mankind for mine."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Subterfuge is the recourse of the heretic."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","The faithful needest not cower in the shadows!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","On this at least we agree, explicator."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Very well. Let the heretic find death in whatever way best suits them."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","We waste time here, imbeciles. Was the splice not best done at Chasm Terminus?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","We come to this pit of iniquity when our task was best completed at the station?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","Thou wouldst have us traverse the whole of Atoma before our work is done."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Hardly a fitting task for the faithful. These imbeciles, on the other hand..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","Even this base soldiery has a use. Grist for the mill in the Master's great plan!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","Their eyes are dull. The righteous fire of fervour hath dimmed."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_station_approach_01","An impressive sight! Wouldst that it be once more devoted to the Master's service."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_station_approach_02","There lieth Chasm Terminus. A grand edifice in need of purification!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_station_hall_01","Raise thine eyes, imbeciles, and imagine this place in its glory!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_station_hall_02","What sorrow to see such a temple of commerce and industry brought low!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_the_bridge_01","The heretics shalt learn the Master's wrath is swift!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_station_the_bridge_02","Look to the south, imbeciles! Behold the Master's righteous fury!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","See what squalor is earnt by faithless deeds? Pray you do not end up thus."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Such squalor! Many are the weak lured to the banner of heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","The heretics' depravity hath brought a daemonic abomination to Tertium."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Tertium is truly lost if a daemon hath made its home here."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Steel thyselves, imbeciles. Only those of true faith can face a daemon and triumph."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","The abomination is weak, but my faith is strong!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","We should purge the heretics. If their collaborators get in the way, tis no loss."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Shouldst we not purge the heretics and restore some semblance of law?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Thou wouldst have me look the other way whilst heretics thrive?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Better a hundred innocents fall before the Master's wrath than one heretic escapes."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","The enforcers failed in their duty here. They shall be judged as surely as the heretics."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","This hive hath become a warren of lawlessness and heresy!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Heresy ever festers in the darkness. We bring the Master's light. And his fury!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","The roots of heresy thrive in such darkness, whilst its branches reach for the weak-willed."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","This holo statue is a sign! Even here, the blessed heroes of the Imperium are with us!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","I shalt offer prayers to this hero of the Imperium, that our victory might be hastened."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","They hath blocked the gates, but the faithless only delay their hour of judgement."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","Content not with turning from the Master's light, the heretics destroy all they touch."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","This hab block is as rotten as the black hearts of its denizens."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","This place looks fit to collapse. Pray the Master sees fit to let you imbeciles leave first."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","If only the sewer-like souls of the heretics could be purified as easily as this water."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","That such slurry can become potable water… Praise be to the Master's bounty!"

"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","The condition of that atmospheric shield is like unto thy faith. Woeful and lacking."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_strain_crossroads_01","Those who wander without righteous purpose are already lost..."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_strain_crossroads_02","Are we lost? No, I mean not thy wretched souls. I mean, really lost?"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Behold, imbeciles! The extent of corruption on this thrice-cursed world hath revealed itself."
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","This refinery is lost to blasphemous design. We must purge this place!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","These tanks are devoid of heretical contagion. Delve deeper, imbeciles!"
"loc_zealot_male_a__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","No heresy detected... our search shalt continue."

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_04_b_01","A noble sentiment, templar, but faith is all the shield I need."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_b_01","There be no respite while the God-Emperor's work remains undone!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_b_01","I've only one tutor, soldier, and he sits the Golden Throne of Terra."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_12_b_01","A closed mind has nothing to fear from scrutiny."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_16_b_01","A glorious death in the God-Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_17_b_01","Good. Comfort be a sure way of inviting corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_01_b_01","With the God-Emperor beside us, we shall not fail!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_07_b_01","A visceral image, kindred. One I could have done without."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_12_b_01","Aye, but bullets have their place for those with malice of mind."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_16_b_01","Ye think to lecture me? Have a care, kindred ..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_17_b_01","Grand. More advice. I cannae get enough of that."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_06_b_01","Heresy grows from idleness."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_07_b_01","Aye! Be strong in your ignorance!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_09_b_01","Even death be not sufficient punishment for the heretic!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_14_b_01","Let them all come! Let them feel my righteous fury!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_01_a_01","We must burn these foulsome heretics with the fires of Purity."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_02_a_01","Fear not death, kindred, unless ye be of tainted soul."

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","Given time, I might even trust ye. Imagine that."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Aye, ye've the heart of a killer. But then that was always the problem."

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","How about you hold your tongue, eh?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","I could cut your throat. That'd hush the voices."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","Ye should aspire to be more like that famous Slab."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Now there be a Slab who understood well his duty."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_defend_a_01","Ye must defend me, kindred. I cannae die with my work undone!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","I cannot concur. A grenade speaks with the God-Emperor's thunderous voice."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","We use what tools we must when heresy runs riot."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Keep the faith, Templar! The God-Emperor will prevail."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","The fires of battle are nought without the righteous fire of faith!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_a_01","Is there nothing worth drinking around here? I've a dowie mood."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_a_02","I don't suppose ye've a nip of liquor to spare, kindred?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_a_03","Kindred, I beseech ye. You'd not resent me a wee dram of something fiery?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","Aye, I feel your need. Alas, I too am bereft."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","Alas that I too am dry, kindred. Alas. Alas."

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_a_02","What has this world become, when heretics are so plentiful?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_a_03","Ach, Atoma fair teems with heretics."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","Be grateful for the holy labour provided to us, Guardian."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","Aye, matters are agley, but we'll set them true."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","Aye, that may be true. But it changes naught."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","Indeed. War shall rage so long as even a single heretic draws breath!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","A faithful soul such as myself deserves better. As for the rest of you ... ?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","Calumny! Cease your blether!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","What are ye havering about the now?"

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","Aye, there is no finer sight than burning heretics!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","Let the pyres blaze and the heretic beware!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","This is what happens when you send an Ogryn to do a bairn's job."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Never mind, Slab. You make a braw shield for the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","So long as the heretics burn first, I am content."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","Curse the darkness all ye like. I prefer a warming pyre of heretic flesh!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","Ye have an unnatural appetite, Slab. I'll be keeping an eye on you..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Greed be but one step on the path to damnation..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","Aye. Such creatures have no place in the God-Emperor's realm."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","The fire will purge them. The fire purges all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","Oh, see this thin-skinned soul, who'd waste good medicae on a wee scratch."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","Only a blackguard would waste medicae on so petty a wound."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","Are ye injured, kindred? Did it hurt?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","Would ye question a warrior of the God-Emperor?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","I acted out of need. As I always do."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","Aye. What I'd not give to see those rolling hills again..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Is that sentiment, Slab? Well well well."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","Ye'll struggle to get a tune out of these scallywags."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","A well-sung hymnal puts me in fine mood for purging the heretic!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","Aye! Let them come! Let them taste the fruits of heresy!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","It does my heart good to hear ye, Guardian!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","You're keen, behemoth! Lifts my heart, it does."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","I share your lament. May this calm be fleeting!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Aye? I'm thinking no."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","And how would that work, exactly?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","No wonder they found such little time for prayer."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Skill and artistry be nothing without penitent prayer."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","Hark at the Freak. They're babbling again."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Hear the Freak? They're mad, I tell ye. Mad!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","If only their demise could be made more lingering!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","Death is too good for their blackened souls!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","I would see such celebrations return when our work be done."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","We'll bring righteous faith back to Atoma... or else see it burn!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","Cease your gumpling, and be silent!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","Have you tried complaining a mite less? That might help."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","Possessions and habitation matter little, so long as faith burns bright!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","A new edifice shall be raised in victory! Have no fear!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","Sounds like a fine idea, lad!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Aye! Think of the righteous devastation!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","You're not frit of this machine, are ye?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","It's only a wee bit knackered. It'll be fine."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","Aye, Guardian, the God-Emperor asks nothing less than a life of duty."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","Praise be, Guardian!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","Ah, I've a scroll here, Guardian, that I've been saving for such an occasion."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","Something from Epistles, perhaps? ""As I have been called to the holy work, so I will call others to me."""
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","Let it bide, kindred. Better to see our labours done first."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Aye, but not until our labours are done."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","I wish I had your strength, Slab. What a reckoning there'd be."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","Your brawn is a gift from the God-Emperor. Be thankful!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Whining about a bit of scran? Toughen up."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Ach, you've gone and got my belly rumbling."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","Ye should keep your sticky thoughts to yourself, Freak!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","Again, ye prove you're not to be trusted!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","Be proud, Slab. Ye are as the God-Emperor wished ye."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","Ach, stop your squalling. We've a job to do."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","A day worth fighting for, aye."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","Praise the God-Emperor and his mercy!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","I could do with putting my feet up for a spell, and no mistake."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","You're a sluggardly keeso of soldier, are ye not?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","Aye? As if you know anything other than bawdy drivel."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","Save your breath for screaming and shouting, kindred."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Stay awake! We can't go dragging you around behind us, now can we?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Ye really are a big old bunch of lazy flesh, aren't ye?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","They're not so impressive up close."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","They die as other mortals. Nothing else matters."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_a_01","Come, kindred! I hunger to bring chastisement!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_a_02","Haste ye, kindred! Let us scour this place clean!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_a_03","On, kindred, on! In the God-Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","Yes! Let the heretic beware! Let the daemon cower!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","I'm with ye, kindred! Let the blood flow!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Are ye afeared of an honest stramash?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","I aye had ye down as feckless. Now I've proof from your own mouth."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","Aye, but righteous work can yet be done by those of devilish aroma."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","It's a miasma thick and bold, true enough."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Why not? It will put a fright into the heretics, if nothing else."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","A desperate measure. But then, these are desperate times."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Yet she be brought low... I feel bodements of further sorrows to come."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","There lurks a rot in these benighted halls. I feel it in my bones."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","The Freak has a point, kindred. We all serve the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","That's ... actually fair. Maybe we should strive for comradeship."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","Aye, slovenliness and heresy so often go hand in hand."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","The seed of heresy despoils all it touches. Eternal vigilance is the only safeguard!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_a_01","I shouldn't be here. My trial was rigged."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_a_02","Ach, but for a corrupt adjudicator, I'd yet be at home."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_a_03","Curse that crooked adjudicator for imprisoning me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Aye, a sad story. Fair brings a wee tear to my cheek."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","Such oppression will not stand, I promise ye."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","This... obsession... with worldly wealth is unseemly."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","If ye start filching, ye'll answer to me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","Ye can trust the God-Emperor, and your blade, and that be about all!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","This place fair reeks of corruption and betrayal..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","Ha! I'll be sniffing out traitors long after ye've perished, Templar."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","We be not your enemy, Templar. We be the God-Emperor's hand of vengeance!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","Come over here and say that. Stand close now."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","Are ye fixing for a rammy with me?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Aye, but it'll be sweaty work afore we're done. Mark my words."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","We'll screenge this place clean, sure enough."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Hush your glaikit prattle!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","You need a good skelping, you do."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","Forgiveness be not guaranteed till punishment be served."
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","You heard the Guardian, kindred. Repent, and be saved!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Praise the God-Emperor in all things!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","Aye, tis a fine and righteous hour in which to strive!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","Aye, but do you have to carry on so?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","Be sure to keep those updates coming."
"loc_zealot_male_b__come_back_to_squad_01","Stay together, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__come_back_to_squad_02","No running off, ye foolish... [Mumble]"

"loc_zealot_male_b__come_back_to_squad_08","It's not safe to be alone, you know."
"loc_zealot_male_b__come_back_to_squad_09","Alone won't end well!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__come_back_to_squad_10","Come back! Do ye hear me?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","This world deserves no less than assault by the saintly hosts of the Ecclesiarchy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","If this be a test of faith, ye shall find I have plenty to spare."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","Everywhere we turn, we hear whispers of the 'Cicatrix Maledictum'. Some blasphemous artefact, I would guess?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","It is a source of corruption, and we are the means of salvation!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","There is a rot in Atoma – a corruption that sinks its roots into the very foundations of the city."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","A marvel of human ingenuity, reaching into the skies for the glory of the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","I fear the rumoured second hive city is no mere fiction, but a nest of heresy beyond imagining."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","Slay it! Slay it!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","I will end ye, Beast!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","Assail it from behind! Where the scunner is weak!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","Dinnae attack from the front! Strike from behind!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","I hear ye, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Aye! The God-Emperor guides me!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","The explicator seems a driven woman."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","Explicator Zola is a mite brusque, is she not?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","She seems a fine servant of the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","A finer tool of righteous purpose, I've seldom seen."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","An inquisitor's acolytes are not always what they seem."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","A woman worth watching, do ye not find?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","Did ye know that Explicator Zola is an Atoman native?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","It seems that this campaign is personal to the explicator. Atoma was her hame."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Origins do not interest me. Only deeds."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","Aye, is that so? What does it matter?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_01","I may have… misjudged… our pilot. Self-flagellation may be in order."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_02","Never did I think to count the pilot amongst the faithful, yet she has surprised me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_03","I have spoken with the pilot, and found her to be one of the pious, after all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_01_04","It transpires our pilot is of the true faith. Too devout for you sinners!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_01","Really? I find that a mite surprising."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_02_02","I've heard it said before. I dinnae believe it now."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_01","Tis the truth! She gave to me this blessed relic, a single strand of Saint Elana’s silver hair!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_02","She gifted me this fragment of marble, which skittered from a Titanolith during her pilgrimage!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_03","Ye may doubt it, but this gift from her is proof! Tis a knucklebone of Saint Tilinia of Eydolim!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_03_04","The light of her faith burns bright. She even gave to me this scrap of holy text, from the Cant of Arch-Cardinal Ignato!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","By the Golden Throne, what a blessing it is to find such light in these dark times."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","Tis strange. I had thought such a relic would be … grander."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","Even our pilot is not without sin. Are ye all sent to test me?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","The pilot’s moral fortitude appears … questionable."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","She shall carry us to our holy purpose, or face the consequences."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","Luckily I have enough faith for us all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","Were there no more pious candidates to bear us on our mission?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","I pray the God-Emperor sees fit to delay her punishment until after we disembark."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","Doubtless another of your so-called ‘visions’."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","The pious care not what your witch-eyes see."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","I have no love for Brunt, but are we not all servants of the God-Emperor?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","Now I know ye lie, for the Ogryn is a brute, like all his kind."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","Glory awaits, Templar. And yet you appear vexed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","I see worry writ large upon your face. Perhaps prayer might help?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Gambling is a sin in the Master’s eyes, as well ye know."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Tis surely beneath ye to partake in such sinful pursuits."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Slay the abomination!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","In the God-Emperor’s name, I smite ye!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","Strike at its head!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","God-Emperor guide our blows upon the creature’s vile head."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","The beast falters!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Yes! Cleave the foul head from its body!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","He should give praise to the fallen, for they have martyred themselves in glorious service."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","And you know this how, witch? I doubt he would speak of his grief to you!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","Through suffering he will find redemption."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","The God-Emperor will offer him solace, or glorious death in service. I care not which."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","Take this as warning – the sergeant is in vexatious mood today."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","The sergeant’s mood this day is blacker than a heretic’s mantle."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","Mayhap the burden of leadership is too much for one so uncouth."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","Be thankful that his effectiveness is not dependant on his manners, for the latter are sorely lacking."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","Morrow should seek solace in prayer. As should ye all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","Misery maketh the man."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","I heard all on Xanatros fell to some vile xenos threat?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","Xanatros? The name has the ring of perfidy about it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","And Morrow faced this threat? Mayhap he was part of the Inquisition, even then."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","Why was he there, I wonder? As an inquisitorial agent?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","They say Morrow fought at Armageddon. A man who beheld such glory should have gladness in his heart!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow must surely be cursed with great age, for he fought at Armageddon."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","Many is the hero of the Imperium whose faith has sustained them through the centuries."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Mayhap the capricious Warp is the cause of his great age. We should watch him closely."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","He should give praise to the God-Emperor for his good fortune, rather than wallow in bitterness."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","As long as he labours in service to the God-Emperor, his mood is irrelevant."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","Do ye not find that Tech-Priest ... disconcerting?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","That Tech-Priest ... I confess, I find her unsettling."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","She perceives a different world, I deem."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","She is loyal to God-Emperor ... although she misnames him."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","You do not want her as an enemy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","Embrace her as you would any other loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_01","Praise be! In the God-Emperor’s name we shall visit redemption upon the sinners of this world!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_02","Glorious days lie before us. We few are chosen for holy purpose, in service to the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_03","At last, this world shall be delivered from darkness by our hands."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_01_04","In the darkest hours, it is the faithful who must light the way. Are ye ready to do the God-Emperor’s bidding?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_01","If the path to redemption were simple, the spiritual rewards would ne’er taste so sweet!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_02","The God-Emperor has forsaken ye not! Be careful of your words, lest ye be judged!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_03","With each trial ahead, we must prove ourselves worthy of the God-Emperor’s blessing!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_one_03_04","Your life of sin may yet destroy your soul. Seize this chance of redemption. For the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_01","Faith in the God-Emperor shall see us triumph."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_02","Remember that the God-Emperor stands with us!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_03","The Master of Mankind will deliver us this day!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_01_04","Have faith in the God-Emperor, and even sinners such as ye might triumph!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_01","The God-Emperor gives us all a burden to bear. It seems you are mine."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_02","Even your simple soul shall understand His glory before the end."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_03","Pray for His mercy, for death is the only release from duty."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_three_03_04","I shall pray for the Emperor’s guidance … and for your soul."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","So many words. So little meaning."
"loc_zealot_male_b__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Your eloquence is an insurmountable obstacle to simple sinners."
"loc_zealot_male_b__cover_me_01","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__cover_me_02","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__cover_me_04","Kindred! I need cover!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__cover_me_07","I need your fire, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__cover_me_10","Cover me, my kindred!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_01","Not good…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_02","Ach, that hurts…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_03","God-Emperor, save your servant…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_04","God-Emperor be with me..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_05","Losing too much blood…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_06","Can't last much longer…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_07","The soul is willing. The flesh bleeds."
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_08","Kindred? I think I'm a goner…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_09","I won't last much longer…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__critical_health_10","Need some healing!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_zealot_male_b__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_zealot_male_b__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_male_b__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_four_c_02","All the more reason to be wary of our shipmistress."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_one_b_01","Aye. Reckon she cares more for this ship than for her fellows."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_one_b_02","She sees service to the God-Emperor not as an honour, but as an imposition."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_one_c_01","Steer clear of that one, kindred, lest ye be sent for a spacewalk without a voidsuit."

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_two_a_03","Bad enough the Rogue Trader's black-marketeering. But treating with xenos? Ach!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_two_a_04","I swear the stench of xenos hangs over the Rogue Trader. Some sins cannae easily be erased."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_two_b_01","Aye, but if she's charges to answer, it's for the God-Emperor to judge."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Her misdeeds will be weighed and measured one day, mark my words."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_two_c_01","Nothing good comes of treating with xenos, kindred. Nothing."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_brahms_two_c_02","The xenos corrupt just as surely as the daemon."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_four_b_01","They spread contagion like we spread the God-Emperor's holy word. It is Heresy most vile."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_four_b_02","They worship a plague-daemon, who they name ""Nurgle"" - a blasphemous mound of filth and virulence."

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_four_c_02","These vile heretics laugh in the face of the righteous, and we rejoice as we scour them from the God-Emperor's sight!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_one_b_01","There be no gods but the God-Emperor. All else be just inhuman things that oppose us - things we must destroy!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_one_b_02","How many times must ye see 'em flee from the light of the faithful. They be not gods. They be cowards!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_one_c_01","Once a heretic forsakes the Emperor, death is insufficient punishment."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_one_c_02","The God-Emperor is the light and the way. Turn from that light, and all that awaits ye is pain."

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_two_a_02","I've heard it said that there be legions of Chaos Space Marines out there - corruptions of the blessed Adeptus Astartes."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_two_a_03","If it's true that even a Space Marine is not incorruptible, we must all be extra vigilant."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_two_a_04","Be pure of heart, kindred. Remember, if even a Space Marine can fall to Chaos, any of you can."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Aye, I've heard the tales, but I'll not believe it till I see the testament of my own eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_two_b_02","I'll not believe tales of the Horus Heresy. It suggests the God-Emperor may be fallible, and that cannae be true."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Think not of these things. Instead, pray for the Adeptus Astartes: defenders of the God-Emperor's light!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_chaos_two_c_02","Best not let Zola hear such talk. Or Morrow for that matter. They might doubt ye faith."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_four_b_01","It be a place of evil, where the enemy dwells."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_four_b_02","It be a sanctuary to the worst heretics, renegades and Daemons in existence."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_four_c_01","It be the source of the largest Daemon incursion ever known. The source of our greatest sorrow."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_four_c_02","Beyond the Eye of Terror lies madness and the end of times. Beware ye its perils."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_one_b_02","The Daemon fears the faithful more than all else. Keep faith, and repel the Warp-spawn!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_one_c_01","The daemonic are without number, and their legions span the galaxy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_one_c_02","Nobody understands the threat of Chaos, till it makes itself known..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_three_b_01","It's good that ye're vigilant against possession. Were ye not, I'd purge you myself."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_three_b_02","Watch this one, kindred. The Freak might become possessed by a Warp-spawned fiend!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_three_c_01","We might sympathise with the curse of the witch, but never - ever - show them mercy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_three_c_02","They don't call us Witch Hunters for nothing. Watch the Freak closely, kindred..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_two_a_01","I still cannae believe the Lion's Gate itself was assailed by Daemons."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_two_a_03","A prayer, kindred, for the Lion's Gate of Terra. Though Daemons assail it, the gate held fast!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_two_a_04","Even the Lion's Gate of Terra be not safe from Daemonic incursions. Be strong, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_two_b_01","Aye, Guardian. Even Holy Terra be not safe while evil dwells in the hearts of men."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Daemons are drawn to corruption. There'll be a glorious purging on Terra now, that there will."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_two_c_01","The heresy must be exorcised utterly, lest it return all the stronger."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_daemons_two_c_02","I hope every last one of them heretics was burned to ash!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_01","A god He be! And one day He'll rise again, mark my words!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","There be no question. That's why he be called the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","Let the God-Emperor's light fill ye! Let His hatred of the heretic guide your wrath!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","Time we all said a wee prayer to the God-Emperor, to beg forgiveness for such loose words."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","Faith, Templar! We may yet prevail without outside aid."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Let us test our own faith against the vile heretics afore we seek assistance!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","I fear if the Adepta Sororitas came to Atoma, things would be dire indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Careful what ye wish for, Templar. Things would have to be bad to summon the Adepta Sororitas."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","It be a fine calling, bringing the God-Emperor's light to benighted worlds."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","The Missionaries kindle the ember of faith amid the ashes of aeons."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","Taking the word of the creed to brothers and sisters long lost to the stars... A noble calling!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","A Missionary be a walking temple. A holy warrior out there in the unknown. Praise be!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_02","We move with glorious purpose! Maybe the Holy Synod themselves might hear of our deeds."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_03","Fight with righteousness, kindred, and ye names may yet be heard by the Holy Synod themselves!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_04","Purge the heretics, and the Holy Synod may add your names to the psalms!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","A poor preacher might dream, Guardian. There be no shame in it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Purge such thoughts of personal glory from ye mind, and be redeemed!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","The Synod were founded by Sebastian Thor himself. It be a lofty institution indeed!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","The Synod be the holiest of the God-Emperor's servants. His very voice on Earth!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","Twisted in flesh is twisted in soul."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_01","Know the mutant; kill the mutant."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","The fate of the mutant is to be purged!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","If your skills were more reliable, Freak, nobody would need to get hurt in the pursuit of information."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","If you find our work unpalatable, there be a place on a Black Ship for ye I'm sure."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","If in doubt, burn them all. The God-Emperor will know his own!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","The heretic might receive absolution in death. The traitor will suffer in this life and the next."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_01","Of all thrice-cursed mutants, the rogue psyker surely be the worst."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_02","I tell ye, kindred, tolerating the psyker be a slippery path to damnation..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_03","Beware the witch: they pose the greatest threat to the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_a_04","Beware the witch. The unsanctioned psyker be a blasphemy against the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","At least they bear their heresy outwardly. The traitor hides it in his soul."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Their minds be like open gates, and the baying hordes of Chaos be waiting on the threshold!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","Nonetheless, we must be unsleeping in vigilance, and strong of mind."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","Strengthen your minds with faith! Only then can ye defeat the witch!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","The Indomitus Crusade be the most glorious muster of heroes for ten thousand years!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Ah, to have seen such righteous war unleashed with my own eyes ..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","Aye, the battle against the unbeliever never ends."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Thrice-cursed be the name of the Despoiler. His end will come, be sure of it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","The Galaxy be death! It be war and fire, faith and blood. It claims us all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","Aye, but they died with hearts full of zeal and faith a-burning in their eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","Remember kindred, we play our own small part. Every heretic we destroy restores light to the darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","We be fighting more of the malefic witch than ever before. Dark times, I tell ye. Dark!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Aye, Freak. And it be why I'm watching you ever more closely..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","We see the disruption of reality on a scale undreamt. And yet, the light of Terra endures!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","The heretic be driven mad by visions of wickedness. But the faithful be guided by visions of the miraculous!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_01","Dark days, kindred, dark days. But worse still for them poor souls in the Imperium Nihilus, beyond the Great Rift."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_02","The Great Rift has severed the God-Emperor's realm. The Imperium Nihilus lies beyond His blessed sight."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_03","Spare a thought for the billions of souls in the Imperium Nihilus. The Great Rift has consigned them to darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_04","Some say the Great Rift be the very gates of Hel, and none know it better than those in the Imperium Nihilus."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","Aye, Guardian, our prayers be with the God-Emperor's servants who even now fight on for the Imperium!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","The ""Dark Imperium"" they call it, for the God-Emperor's light no longer illuminates it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","They say a thousand Space Marine chapters remain lost... Prayers be with the God-Emperor's chosen warriors."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","All we can do is our part, kindred. We fight the heretic in what ways we can, in the god-Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Aye. They flock to Grendyl's banner like the faithful to prayer."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","The battle to come will sift the wheat from the chaff."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","Too many of 'em be lily-livered scrowls by my reckoning."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","Dark days ahead, kindred. Will they be up to the task?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","We'll be told when we're worthy, and not before."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","If ye believe our purpose to be righteous, then ye trust in Grendyl to lead us."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","Ha! Ye'd have the Inquisition reveal their secrets? That be madness."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","Blessed is he with the closed mind. Damned is he who questions…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Silence, witch! It be not your place to question the Inquisition."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","You should count yer blessings for that, Freak."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","Rannick be a capable substitute, if not much of a warrior."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","Grendyl need only command, and I'll see righteous fire visited upon our enemies!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_01","Do ye not agree that Grendyl be a paragon of faith?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_02","Kindred, can ye not feel righteous faith in every word Grendyl utters?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_03","Inquisitor Grendyl truly be a faithful scion of the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_a_04","It be glorious to serve one of the true faith like Grendyl!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","Aye. The light of the God-Emperor guides Grendyl's steps."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","Grendyl calls us to holy work, and we must answer!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Obedience without question: that's proper faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","If ye lack strength, the next best thing is a strong leader!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_four_b_01","What? The Tech-Priest does nothing but bark and blether!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Ye hit your head, Brute? The Tech-Priest's havering gives me a headache."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Maybe the Brute has an instinct for commands. Like a pet."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_four_c_02","To truly understand the Tech-Priest's blethering would be one of the God-Emperor's miracles."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_one_b_01","More pragmatic than most of her creed, but soulless all the same."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_one_b_02","She be diligent in her duties, even if her faith be questionable."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_one_c_01","The Tech-Priest be a dour, sleekit sort, but her diligence cannot be faulted."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_one_c_02","The Tech-Priests skills have saved us many a time, even if her manner be strange."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Ye best not be prying on us!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Ye be here under sufferance, freak. Test me not!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_three_c_01","I knew it be a mistake to bring a psyker along…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_three_c_02","God-Emperor preserve us from the unnatural powers of the witch!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_a_01","If ye think Morrow be old, what about the Tech-Priest? Older still, I reckon."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_a_02","I'd be not surprised to learn the Tech-Priest is centuries old, judging by appearances."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_a_03","There be something unnatural about the Tech-Priest, like she's seen too many years."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_a_04","The Tech-Priest seems blessed with great age."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_b_01","Weakness of the flesh be removed, but at what cost to the soul?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_b_02","At least she be not stripped of all humanity, like others of her kind."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_c_01","Aye, we can all dream of serving the God-Emperor beyond the span of mortal years."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hadron_two_c_02","Such longevity be wasted on a soulless machine."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","The wages of sin be not so gratifying as righteous work."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","I hear the work be both dangerous and dishonest."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Money is well and good, but wouldn't ye rather fight for faith?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Stick with us, brute, and ye may yet feel the God-Emperor's blessing."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","I not be one for idle gossip, soldier. But… What have ye heard?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","You mean the Purser? I fear she not be one of the true faith."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","The interrogator dislikes her much… I trust his judgment."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","She be an enemy to Rannick, I hear. Make yerselves scarce when they lock horns."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Aye, and I've heard nothing good comes from bartering with her."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","There's a saying: never trust a merchant with gold teeth."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","The penitent have no need of worldly possessions. Just as well…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","If she opened her heart to the God-Emperor, she'd cast aside her miserly ways."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_01","What make ye of the purser, kindred? Seems her behaviour grows worse by the day."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_02","The purser be not a woman of faith. Dark deeds lurk in her past, mark my words."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_03","The purser be raucous in her cups, and quick to anger. A faithless sort."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_a_04","Watch out for the purser, kindred. She's got a mean streak a mile wide."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","Aye. Little more than a bodyguard I hear, playing at being purser."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Agreed. She been too long outside the God-Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","One black look from her could turn back an orbital bombardment."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","She be the worst kind of tyrant. The faithless kind."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Those of rank live spireside, where we pray they remain safe."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","There be the God-Emperor's chosen few. The rulers of the hive and all within."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Those who scale the pinnacles of glory have the furthest to plunge into the abyss."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","The privileged few be the God-Emperor's chosen, but only so long as they be beyond reproach."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Aye, Templar. I'd love a wee crack at ministering to this rabble, if you take my meaning."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","They be lacking the God-Emperor's guidance, administered with a firm hand."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","They transgress against the God-Emperor's law. Permitting them to live is a crime in itself."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","A hive-city is a marvel of human ingenuity, reaching to the skies in exultation to the God-Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_b_02","Ninety billion souls in a city so tall it pierces the atmosphere. How can anyone not see it as a miracle?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Maybe your faith'll be restored once we get these thrice-cursed heretics out of here."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","When our mission is done, kindred, maybe ye'll see Hive Tertium with fresh eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_01","Atoma be called the jewel in the crown of Moebian industry. It must be saved!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_02","Atoma's manufactorums be a part of the God-Emperor's great plans. We can't let them fall."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_03","The Manufactorums of this hive be vital to the war effort. By the God-Emperor, we must protect them."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_a_04","They say each manufactorum on Atoma is worth three lesser factories in the segmentum."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","Hard work conquers everything. Blessed are they who toil in the God-Emperor's name."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","Moebian steel be the finest in the segmentum, and the secrets of its forging be Atoma's greatest asset."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","Hard work earns salvation. The labourers may die content, but the metalfabs are irreplaceable."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","The dead cry out for revenge. It be our duty to provide it!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Will the Bell of Lost Souls mark our passing? I think not."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_four_c_01","I suppose ye'd have them make a Titanolith of you as well! To stand alongside Dracos the Conqueror?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_four_c_02","Who do ye think you are? Sebastian Thor? Ha!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_one_b_01","Maybe one day I'll meet a pilgrim who trod Terran soil. I'd be content just with that."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_one_b_02","I be unworthy even to dream of seeing the Ecclesiarchal Palace."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_one_c_01","Maybe I'll take on the pilgrimage when my duty be done. God-Emperor willing."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_one_c_02","Terra lives in our hearts. Revere it, as ye would the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_three_b_01","The tithe grade be calculated with care. A world only pays what it can afford to give."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_three_b_02","Don't doubt the Administratum, Freak. The Imperial Tithe be fairly reckoned."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_three_c_01","Those who forget their duty have no place in the bosom of humanity."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_three_c_02","Death awaits those who would shun their obligations to the Imperium."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_a_01","To think, the Imperium contains a million worlds, maybe more!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_a_02","The God-Emperor rules a million worlds. Does it not fill ye with awe?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_a_03","This world be but one of a million that make up the Imperium."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_a_04","The God-Emperor rules a million worlds. He'll not let a single one fall. Not even this one."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_b_01","In a vast galaxy, ye'll not be missed unless ye hold the faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_b_02","Don't think our work here be fruitless. The God-Emperor has plans for us all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_c_01","And at the heart of the Imperium lies Holy Terra - the cradle of Humanity!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_imperium_two_c_02","Even Atoma can be redeemed. The God-Emperor will welcome it back into the fold."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","I wouldn't tempt fate, Slab. Not without an agent of the Ordo Sicarius present to control them."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","Pah! This be a job for the Inquisition, not some sneekit scrowl!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","What I wouldn't give to see the Eversor at work. Naet more honest than a blade to the ribs."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","Long as it's an Eversor. Looking the heretic in the eye as ye slay him. That's the God-Emperor's work!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","I've always been fond of the Atmospheric Incinerator... Cleanse the world with fire!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","The Atmospheric Incinerator has a certain appeal."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","I'd be loath to destroy this world. Not while there's souls to be saved."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","In an Imperium of a million worlds, what matters the loss of one?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","If the God-Emperor's laws had been applied with vigour, we'd not be needed here."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","It be a responsibility that weighs heavy on the shoulders of the chosen."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","Look to the Lex Imperialis, kindred. It'll steer ye true."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","I read the Lex Imperialis daily. No infraction gets past me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_01","Be there any more righteous calling than the Ordo Hereticus?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_02","The work of the Ordo Hereticus surely be the most vital in the Imperium!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_03","Of all the Ordos of the Inquisition, Hereticus be the calling of the faithful!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_a_04","Ye should be proud, kindred. The Ordo Hereticus be the pinnacle of righteousness!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","Finally, I can burn heretics without fear of arrest!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","You know what they say, kindred: true happiness is a hobby that becomes your job."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","After the Age of Apostasy, a creed like ours were sorely needed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","Heresy blooms in the unlikeliest places, and the Ordo Hereticus must root it out."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","The God-Emperor's will and the Machine Spirit within make the workings of the throne unknowable."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","Belief, Slab! Our belief in the God-Emperor. His belief in the might of the Imperium. Belief is all!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","Only the God-Emperor can power the throne. By his unending vigil are we kept safe."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","The throne and the God-Emperor are as one, and while both endure, the Imperium endures."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","His blessed crusade was an example to all!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","The Imperium were crying out for a hero like Saint Macharius."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","They say he wanted to push on to the Halo Zone, beyond the light of the Astronomican."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","If he'd been surrounded by braver heroes, he might even have conquered the Halo Zone."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","An open mind be like a fortress with its gate unbarred and unguarded. Ignorance is strength!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","I'll have ye know I learned much about burning heretics from the glorious Age of Redemption!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Reach out to embrace the glories that will come, and dwell not on the sins of the past."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","In an hour of Darkness a blind man be the best guide. Heed this lesson well."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_01","Could be worse, kindred. We could be in the Age of Apostasy, the blackest era in history."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_02","Sometimes I think back to the Age of Apostasy, where the Ecclesiarchy almost fell, and weep."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_03","There was a time when the Ecclesiarchy was all but destroyed. It was the Age of Apostasy, our darkest hour."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_a_04","Kindred, I've been meditating of late on the Ecclesiarchy's darkest hour: the Age of Apostasy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","The Reign of Blood, brought about by the traitor, Goge Vandire. May he burn with helfire still!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","The Reign of Blood, they called it. Goge Vandire, the false Ecclesiarch, was the vilest of traitors."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Were it not for Sebastian Thor, the Ecclesiarchy wouldn't have survived Vandire's plot."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","We give praise still to Sebastian Thor and the Confederation of Light, saviours of the Imperium!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_four_b_01","It must be so, brute for him to hold his position."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_four_b_02","We all be loyal to the God-Emperor, yet we be not so insufferable."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_four_c_01","His allegiance be not in doubt… but what of his faith?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_four_c_02","A lifetime of service. A lifetime of secrets."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_one_b_01","Don't go letting Grendyl hear you say that. It's Lord Melk tae the likes of you!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_one_b_02","Careful. With a stroke of his quill the venerable Lord Melk could have ye jettisoned."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_one_c_01","Barely understand a word Melk says, but I respect his diligence."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_one_c_02","His talents be many. The art of conversation be not amongst them."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_three_b_01","I hope ye not be crawling about inside the administrator's head, witch."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_three_b_02","Are ye prying on the thoughts of our fellows again, witch?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_three_c_01","For all his airs and graces, he be here for the same reason as the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_three_c_02","No one joins this crew willingly. He be paying a debt, or seeking redemption."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_a_01","I believeth not that Melk judgeth my diction to be improper!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_a_02","That fellow Melk took issue with my vocabulary. Can ye believe that?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_a_03","According to Melk I be too uncouth in language to give a good sermon!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_a_04","Lord Melk think me language be uncouth. He can go boil his head!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_b_01","He's a cold fish. He don't understand the righteous fire of a good sermon."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_b_02","Pah! Melk's just a sklaterscrae, ye ken?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_c_01","In the end, we be judged on the purity of our souls, not the state of our diction."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_melk_two_c_02","The man should spend less time planning and more time praying."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_four_b_01","Impossible - the only cure for such corruption be the mercy of death."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_four_b_02","A wicked rumour, to place doubt on the purity of such a man."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_four_c_01","It'd explain his dour demeanour, but it be an outlandish claim."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_four_c_02","It be unwise to court corruption with such loose talk."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Morrow's a war hero for sure, but this sounds like a tall tale indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_one_b_02","I'd barely be surprised. He's a wicht one for sure."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_one_c_01","If all these stories be true, Morrow deserves a sainthood."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_one_c_02","I'd quit yer havering if I were ye."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_three_b_01","Maybe he seeks glorious death in service to the God-Emperor. Ye wouldn't understand."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_three_b_02","A man who beheld such glories would be of more cheer, don't ye think?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_three_c_01","The sergeant strikes me not as a blowhard, so who be telling the tales?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_three_c_02","There be no doubting his skill in battle, even if there's a shadow over his past."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_a_01","Kindred, have ye heard about Morrow? They say he fought the Tyranids at Macragge."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_a_02","I can scarce believe it… I hear Morrow fought at Macragge, and saved the life of Lord Calgar himself!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_a_03","If the rumours be true, Morrow served at Calth, and fired the very shot that gave Old One Eye its name!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_a_04","Hark, kindred! Did ye hear our very own Morrow is a decorated hero of Macragge?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Seems a tall tale indeed. It's unbefitting to haver so."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_b_02","Weesht! Morrow would be long in his grave if it were true."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_c_01","I don't doubt Morrow's tenacity, but he be just a man."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_morrow_two_c_02","If half the tales of Morrow be true, he must indeed be blessed by the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_01","The Mourningstar be a fine vessel, kindred. A mighty cathedral of war!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_02","I be awestruck at the might and majesty of the Mourningstar."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_03","The God-Emperor chose a mighty cathedral of war in the Mourningstar."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_a_04","With the Mourningstar as our craft, what heretic be fool enough to stand before us?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Aye, and yet it serve the likes of Brahms. The God-Emperor's ways be strange."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","A thing of beauty, sure enough, wrought by artisans."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","Leastways it now be pressed into righteous service."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","The Mourningstar will carry us to glory, kindred, be sure of it!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Maybe Rannick's presence in battle would be more a hindrance than a help."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Rannick be the Emperor's voice. We be his sword!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_four_c_01","I don't doubt the strength of his conviction; only the strength of his arm."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_four_c_02","It be his loss, kindred. He's missing out on righteous glory!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He be a fair taskmaster, devoted to rooting out heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_one_b_02","A man of rare devotion to the cause he is."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_one_c_01","Victory against the vilest foe: that's the only way to earn his respect."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_one_c_02","If it be Rannick's trust ye want, ye'll have to earn it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_three_b_01","He's steered us true so far - maybe he be chosen by the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_three_b_02","Advancement within the Holy Ordo be a noble and honourable pursuit."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_three_c_01","We must trust that he'll see this holy mission through."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_three_c_02","He does righteous work. Let the God-Emperor judge how well."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_a_01","Something bothers me about the Interrogator… I fear he be lacking in faith."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_a_02","Ye ever see Rannick give prayer? I reckon he be not a devout man."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_a_03","I hear Interrogator Rannick's lost his faith along the way. It be a worry…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_a_04","We must of strong faith, kindred, for I reckon the Interrogator be not a devout man."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_b_01","It cannot be true. Ye don't enter the Ordo Hereticus unless ye be strong of faith."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_b_02","I don't believe it - it's his faith that makes him braw."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_c_01","He may not show it, but I reckon Rannick be as faithful as any of us."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_rannick_two_c_02","If he weren't a righteous man, he wouldn't lead us to victory."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_servitors_one_b_01","They serve the God-Emperor through all the ravages of time."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_servitors_one_b_02","Some say they be made in the God-Emperor's image."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_servitors_one_c_01","Think of the Imperium as a great machine, kindred, and we all be cogs in the God-Emperor's plan."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_servitors_one_c_02","Those who toil without complaint be truly blessed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","I've heard it called the ""Forge of Strength"", possessed by all the Adeptus Astartes."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_b_02","A sacred rite, performed only on those worthy of becoming a Space Marine."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","They be immune to corruption of the body. Reckon their minds be just as strong."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","The strength of the Adeptus Astartes comes not from geneseed, but from faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","If the task were beyond us, the Adeptus Astartes would come. Have faith, kindred."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","That would be a fine sight indeed. A glorious sight!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","I'd die content in the purifying fire of an Ordo Malleus assault."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","Some say they don't exist, but I say the blessed Grey Knights watch Atoma with interest..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","The God-Emperor has restored Guilliman's titles... Salvation is near!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","The ""Blade of Unity"" they call him. And that's what we need now, more than ever."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","Remember - Guilliman be blessed indeed, but only the God-Emperor be worthy of our devotion."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","How blessed we are to live in such times!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_a_01","There be much wisdom in Guilliman's Codex Astartes, even for mere mortals."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_a_02","I read recently some passages from Guilliman's sacred Codex Astartes. A remarkable work!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_a_03","Do ye not think Guilliman's Codex Astartes be one of the finest tomes ever penned?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_a_04","To think how much the Imperium owes to Guilliman's sacred Codex Astartes..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","We should all be more like Guilliman: Untainted by doubt or self-aggrandisement."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","A tome born of humility. Pity we all cannae be as wise as Guilliman."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","Guilliman selflessly gave up great power, that the Imperium could prosper."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","The Codex Astartes be born of selflessness. It be a warning against hubris and ambition."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","He be a lordly man, the best of humanity, perfect in form and of mind."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","He be the king of kings, crowned with lightning, radiant with glory!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Some say the God-Emperor will one day be reborn, and once more lead his armies to glorious purpose!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","The Divine Will of the God-Emperor may take many forms, and all of them majestic!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","He speaks to ye very soul. Heed Him well!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","The God-Emperor has no need of words! Those of the faith understand Him well enough."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","The God-Emperor shows his will only to the High Lords of Terra, blessed as they are!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","Through sheer will does the God-Emperor command the High Lords of Terra."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","They should be thankful! Their sacrifice strengthens the light of the Astronomican."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","And without that sacrifice, the Astronomican fails, and we be plunged into darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","Better to burn bright in the Astronomican than burn on the witch-pyre, eh."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","With faith there must sometimes come sacrifice. It be not our choice the when and where."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_a_01","Kindred, let us pause to give thanks for the God-Emperor's great sacrifice!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_a_02","Each day I be moved by thoughts of the God-Emperor's sacrifice."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_a_03","Be ye not moved to prayer when you imagine the God-Emperor's supreme sacrifice?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_a_04","We fight in the name of the God-Emperor, so his supreme sacrifice be not in vain!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","Aye, guardian. We can only pray we might be so selfless in the end."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","The God-Emperor made the Golden Throne, knowing what may come. Yet willingly he went!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","Praise the Emperor whose sacrifice is life as ours is death."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","The God-Emperor be an example, kindred. Never give in to the darkness."

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","Every such voyage be miraculous. Every safe arrival a blessing."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Imagine how bad it'd be if the God-Emperor did not guide our way."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Further out ye get from the God-Emperor's light, the more unpredictable it gets."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","A moment of silence perhaps for those poor souls lost in the Warp."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","Praise be to the God-Emperor, who has delivered us safely once more!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_a_01","When last I Warp-jumped, I scunnered at the presence of something noisome... something unholy."

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","It's the Astral Hounds I cannae abide, slavering and howling into the void..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","Focus on ye prayers, kindred, lest ye be torn asunder by a pack of Astral Hounds!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","A pair of stranger bedfellows I never saw."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","Ye should all stay clear of that one, heed my words!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","Heed me well: the God-Emperor judges us by the company we keep."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","The witch be barely human. How can she be a tool in service to the God-Emperor?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","Praise be that the witch be shackled. I loathe the sight of her."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","I don't need the likes of her to strengthen my mind. Faith gives me a will of iron!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Steel your minds against the witch, kindred, or who knows what ye'll let in."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","I don't listen to that Freak. A closed mind be a safe mind!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","Those of true faith should spend as little time as possible with her …"

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","Aye. We should spend more time purging witches than hearkening to 'em."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","The righteous be undeserving of the freak's training methods."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","Best place for the likes of her be on a pyre!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_war_end_b_01","If the God-Emperor wills it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_war_end_b_02","Aye, once every heretic's been purged from this cursed world."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_war_end_c_01","Long as there be corruption in this galaxy, we must fight!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_war_end_c_02","One day the last heretic might fall, but we'll not live to see it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Oh aye, it's true. Genestealers, I heard them called. And they be foul indeed..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Aye, Slab. Foul hybrids of alien and man, who worship ravening xenos as gods..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_four_c_01","They fester in distant colonies and crowded hives. That's why ye need Missionaries to root them out."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_four_c_02","They thrive in nests of the faithless, but like all xenos they shrink from the righteous!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_one_b_01","We've blasphemy enough to contend with, kindred, without worrying about accursed xenos."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Aye, there be no end to the abomination of the alien."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_one_c_01","Ye can count on contact with the accursed xenos to renew one's faith in Humanity."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_one_c_02","The Tyranids be worst of all. Their blasphemous existence has but one solution: Extermination."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_three_b_01","There's some who might suffer the presence of the alien, but not me!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_three_b_02","The teachings of the alien be no substitute for faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_three_c_01","Even Belisarius Cawl has embraced the heresy called ""innovation"". Is nothing sacred...?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_three_c_02","Even studying the physical form of the alien is heresy. They are to be destroyed, utterly and without trace!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_a_01","Ye think it's true that the Aeldari worship false idols?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_a_02","The Aeldari think themselves a race of prophets, but mark my words they're headed for a fall."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_a_03","I hear some in the Inquisition put stock in Aeldari prophecies. That way lies madness!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_a_04","Some say the Aeldari are wise. I say they deserve nought but hate!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_b_01","Heard they summon fire-wreathed daemons to their aid. Proof of their heretical natures!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_b_02","They bring their so-called god to battle. It be an affront to all we hold sacred."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_c_01","For all we know, their dabbling brought about these dark times!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_xenos_two_c_02","They've fought with us many times, it's said, but always they betray us in the end."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_four_b_01","A brute ye may be, but sometimes ye speak a mote of sense."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_four_b_02","Aye. The explicator has been forged in the crucible of strife."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_four_c_01","She fights with righteous zeal, and that's good enough for me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_four_c_02","She doesn't shrink from righteous battle, unlike some I could mention."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_one_b_01","Hearts and minds be not won with mirthless demeanour."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_one_b_02","Aye, we must hope she be as devout as she appears."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_one_c_01","Dark times be ahead, kindred, and that'll test her mettle."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_one_c_02","We'll see if her faith in the God-Emperor holds when all this be done."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_three_b_01","A chequered past be valuable motivation for the righteous."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_three_b_02","Aye, she's afeared of something, but it be not for you to discover, Freak."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_three_c_01","The God-Emperor bids us follow her, so follow her we will."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_three_c_02","She's been plucked from ignominy by the God-Emperor. That be enough for me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_a_01","The Explicator be the pious sort. Refreshing to find a kindred spirit at last."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_a_02","Faith, fire and steel, kindred. That's all ye need. Look to Zola as an example."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_a_03","Look to Zola, kindred. Now there be a true servant of the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_a_04","Zola be a tool of righteous purpose. Pay heed, kindred, and ye'll yet be blessed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_b_01","Aye, but she's a dour one. There be trouble in her past, mark my words."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_b_02","Outwardly, maybe, but the content of her heart be concealed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_c_01","If she leads us to glorious battle against the God-Emperor's enemies, it be enough for me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__lore_zola_two_c_02","Trust to your own faith, kindred, not that of others."
"loc_zealot_male_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","Faith cannot move this burden alone!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","By the saints – I have it!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_alarm_01","Can we not kill that dratted alarm?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_alarm_02","That alarm is making my head ring!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","Aye, that door's not for moving ..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","Sealed tight and us on the other side. Alas. Alas, alas, alas."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","There be many secrets buried here ... I can smell them."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","Learning be nothing next to faith, kindred."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","Where do you suppose these traitors may be found?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Traitors in our midst. Who do ye suppose they are?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","I'm glad of the battle. It hides the click-whirr of all those soulless servitors."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","A grand edifice, aye, but did it need so many servitors?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","I don't take kindly to all this ... sloshing around."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","Smells like heresy down here. Old, liquefied heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","This be a fool's errand when the train be there for the taking."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Let's drive the train into the heretics' nest like the God-Emperor's righteous fist!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","If it be easy, they'd not need the righteous to do it, eh, kindred?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Come, kindred! There be no easy path to salvation."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Ye be an odd one, Tech Priest. How came ye to join this kindred?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","The God-Emperor's ways are mysterious. Why else would he send ye here, Tech-Priest?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","Aye. We all serve the God-Emperor in our own way..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Fine. Just do ye duty, and let the God-Emperor be the judge of ye."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Pray that the reinforcements arrive in time, kindred."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","If the support team abandons us to our fate, I'll pray for your souls, kindred."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","Ye hear that, kindred? More of the faithful flock to our cause!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","If they be tardy, there'll be no heretics left for 'em to smite!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","The God-Emperor praises such dutiful toil."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","They throw themselves into their work, to take their minds off the growing dark."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Ye got us lost, didn't ye?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","They say the God-Emperor brings light to the lost..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_something_big_01","Be on ye guard, kindred. Something wicked came through here."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_something_big_02","The stink of corruption hangs in the air."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","These fellows be lacking righteous fire in their bellies if ye ask me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","So these lazy slugs stand watch while we do the God-Emperor's work?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","The Water Cartel have reached far, and fallen short."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","So the cartel has fallen? Good riddance, says I."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Pay them no mind, explicator. No mind at all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","The God-Emperor has a plan for us all. Even if that plan amounts to nothing."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The Water Cartel’s weakness is a lesson concerning the wages of sin."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","This Water Cartel fell swiftly, wouldn't ye say?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Truth, explicator. Holy truth."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Sin always find the sinner."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","I sense you have come far, Sister Zola."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","You're an example of zealous service, explicator. It makes me curious about your past."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Fear not, the God-Emperor sees your service."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","[Sigh] A murky past is it?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_insignia_01","The Water Cartel? Hah. Scunners all, and faithless besides."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_insignia_02","The cartel coveted power. But power was never theirs to claim."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","The Emperor provides all we need. Those who sift the mire do so out of greed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","Hardship is the blessing of the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","This district crumbles. The God-Emperor reaches forth his hand to sweep it away!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","The denizens rot - body, habitation and soul. They are our lesson, kindred."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","The faithless strive only for conflict, even if only with each other."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","See this disharmony of the faithless, kindred?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_shanty_01","This squalid shanty town might yet be saved, if the God-Emperor wishes it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_shanty_02","The faithful need neither riches nor comfort. Cleanliness, however …"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_water_course_01","The water seethes with corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cartel_water_course_02","I wonder how many have met their doom in this river?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","Ach, the scunnered thing's too slow! Fight with zeal, kindred!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","There be time enough to slay heretics afore the elevator arrives!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","Not that I'm not enjoying the run-around, but why are we doing this?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","The hairs on my palms are twitching, kindred. There's more to this than is let on."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","Aye, I thought it'd be something of the sort."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","We're doomed, I tell ye."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","Assuming we don't all die in the next few minutes, who's getting this message anyhow?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","I'm still not clear on who's getting this transmission."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Aye well ... ye cannae blame a body for trying."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","I thought ye'd say that."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","I confess, I've a hankering to know more about the message."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","I cannae deny ... this message intrigues me."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Aye, worthy enough. Wars turn on less."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","I be satisfied, though this secrecy rankles my soul."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","Ach, I'd far prefer to be hunting an arch-heretic than delivering missives."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Aye, this is a strange one. No business of mine."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","Aye, the traitors have been busy here? Can it be repaired?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","Defiled, all of it! Can the desecration be undone?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","Fancy words. Be more direct in future."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","[Sigh] Directness and simplicity are not your virtues."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The loss of workers will cost this place."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","So many dead labourers. Martyrs all … who'll toil in their stead?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","The God-Emperor, in his wisdom, has a plan for us all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","To give one’s life in service to the God-Emperor. That's true glory."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","Is one manufactorum really so vital?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","All this for a single manufactorum, eh?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Praise be to the God-Emperor! We have a duty to perform."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","We shall triumph this day, just ye see!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_heat_01","The heat of redemption. It purifies!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_heat_02","[Ragged Breath] This must be what sinners feel as their feet touch the fires of Hel."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Ye shall experience infernal heat again, soon enough."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_leaving_02","Damnation behind us,  glory ahead. What a life!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","There is far to fall. Further still, for the faithless."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","Don't mind the drop. Each step we take is one step closer to salvation."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Push onwards to Coolant Control!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","Tarry not! We must reach Coolant Control!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Ah, armour almost as strong as faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Leman Russ battle tanks … Named for a legend."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","They sleep beside their stations? Such dedication is its own reward."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","The workers have made a hab-chamber here. It's humbling to see such devotion."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_deception_01","Deceiving the heretics should be simple enough."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_deception_02","Deceive a nest of heretics? Aye, I can do that."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","Ach! A proud hall of justice, now in ruins."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","Many a heretic has been sentenced here, and will be again!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Nary an enforcer to be seen."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","If the enforcers' faith had been true, they'd still be around."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Ach, sounds like the enforcers were too soft!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Where lenience dwells, heresy thrives."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Were ye not raised hereabouts, explicator? Did your sordid past bring you to these blocks?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","I reckon you know the dark secrets of this place all too well, explicator."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I think ye should pray for forgiveness, explicator. While you can."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","The God-Emperor has given ye a second chance, explicator. Use it wisely."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Prison be a strange place for a heretic to hide."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","So the arch-heretic hides in a prison? A cowardly foe!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","You'd need faith indeed to live up there."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","The strongest faith will shake if its foundations be weak."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","A crime in itself that such a feat of engineering falls to rust and ruin."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","Such disrepair. The governance of this hive is found wanting."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","Such reeking foulness beneath the feet of civilisation… Now there's a lesson."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","Ach, by the Throne, that reek!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","A more iniquitous marketplace ye'll ne'er see…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","I think the trading at this market was not of the sanctioned kind."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Mind your footing, kindred. This hab's all a-squint."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","I fear this hab's about ready to topple over."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_alive_01","Steel your hearts! The smelter wakes!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_alive_02","Restore the God-Emperor's smelter!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","Be there any truth that these tanks be doubly blessed?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","What's so special about these battle tanks, that we be sent here?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","The God-Emperor protects!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","Hear that, kindred? We cannae shirk from our duty here."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Be ye trustworthy, Tech-Priest? Ye say little enough."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","Careful, kindred: we know nothing about this Mechanicus 'priest'."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","If all ye do is blether, maybe ye should keep quiet after all."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Now I know more about ye, but like ye less."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","The God-Emperor protects! Why else be this place not destroyed?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","There be hope yet, kindred. The heretics have failed to defile this metalfab."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","There be darkness ahead should the heretic succeed..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","Then our duty is clear, kindred! Do not falter."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","Find the smelter, kindred! There be the path to redemption."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","Righteous cause be found at the smelter, aye?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Come, kindred, lest ye burn like a blasphemer!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_hellhole_02","We should seek the God-Emperor's sanctuary elsewhere."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Yon machines be dormant. The God-Emperor's purpose thwarted."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_lifeless_02","The death of industry be an insult to the litanies of duty."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","Have at it, kindred! We'll meet the heretics head-on!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","Through the main gate, kindred. To victory in the emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Sad to see this place empty. Honest toil is the God-Emperor's gift."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_propaganda_02","The workers here had great purpose. Cheers ye hearts, does it not?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Hold them back! The God-Emperor will deliver us, ye'll see!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Make a stand, kindred. The righteous will prevail!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","Ach... The scunnered smell of corruption is on the air."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Be on ye guard, kindred. The very air be thick with corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","Is this manufactorum so vital to the God-Emperor's plan?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","This place feels foul, yet it be vital to our plan... Why so?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_hack_01","I have ever been a seeker of truth. Today is no different."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_hack_02","Come, kindred! We have a machine to interrogate!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_hack_03","We will have the truth from this machine!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","This place has been abandoned a long time."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","What are a few centuries in the God-Emperor's immortal life?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","The God-Emperor shall see it reclaimed, have no doubt."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","We shall purge the heretics with flame! How else would we combat a plague?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","Corruption within, corruption without. I am not surprised."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Pestilence is the bodily manifestation of heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Faith is all the protection I need against such foul concoctions."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","This place once thronged with the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","Unfitting to see this place of sanctioned commerce laid low."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","The endeavours of mankind may be fleeting, but the glory of the God-Emperor is eternal!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","I believe this place will thrive once more, once reclaimed."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_interior_01","Looks ready to collapse. Shoddy work."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_scavenge_interior_02","Mind your step, kindred. Wouldn't want this place to become our tomb."

"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","Must we enter the belly of the beast unprepared?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","We know not what we face down there..."

"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Better to take the fight to the heretic, with fire and righteous fury!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","I suppose even skulking about has its place in the Emperor's grand plan..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","We'll not flinch in the face of duty, be assured!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Then let's cleanse this place with the blood of the heretic!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","Kindred, was the station not the best place for the splice?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","The God-Emperor would not see his servants run about on fools' errands..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","If the task be easy, It's like not to be worthy of the Emperor's blessing."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","You hear that, kindred? Roaming these sin-filled streets is the simpler option..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","These soldiers be lacking in faith, kindred. We should lead by example."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","Look at them. Martyrs in the making. It fair makes the heart sing!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_station_approach_01","There be the station. Righteous battle beckons!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_station_approach_02","Maybe pride in this feat of engineering was the first step toward sin."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_station_hall_01","[Growl] In the God-Emperor's name, I'll drive the heretics from this place!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_station_hall_02","A marvel of human ingenuity, befouled by the faithless..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Our purpose leads us away from glorious battle. Pray for the martyrs!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","Tread careful, kindred. This place be a nest for faithless vermin."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","So many heretics crammed into so small a space…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","So, it be a daemon we face. A test of faith and courage!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Daemon ye say? Praise be for this chance to smite such a foe!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","I'd sooner see Tertium destroyed than suffer a daemon to live."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","The daemon thrives on fear, but fears faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Say the word and I would scour every last heretic from this place."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","I'm not sure this place be worth saving, but I'll see the Emperor's will done."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","I'd rather see the wretched Torrent burn than let the heretics have it."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","When our mission is complete, maybe there be work yet to do in the Torrent…"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","This be a foul nest of heretics, all cowering from the God-Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","There be not one citizen left in the Torrent with a soul worth saving..."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","If they have not faith, they be the enemy. No more, no less."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","There be no mercy for those who turn from the God-Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","A holo statue, here? It surely be a sign!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_02","A holo statue. Even in darkness, the God-Emperor's light guides us!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","Mere rubble shan't protect them from the God-Emperor's wrath!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","Our path be blocked, but faith shall guide us on."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","This corrosion be... unnatural."

"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","Ah, kindred, what a blessed example of function over form."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","Ach! A heap of rusted metal stands between survival and blessed release."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","God-Emperor preserve us. If that atmospheric shield fails, we'll be goners!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_crossroads_01","God-Emperor, show the way, that I might smite your enemies!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_crossroads_02","We should pray for guidance. Unless anyone has a map?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_01","Into the belly of the beastie we go, carrying the Emperor's light!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_daemonic_overgrowth_a_02","The daemon recoils from our faith, kindred. Be ye strong of stomach and seek triumph!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","Keep searching. If there be corruption here, I'll root it out!"

"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Fret not, kindred. It's just the stutterin of a faithless machine."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Oh, to be here when the purge of the unclean begins!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","Ye hear that, kindred? We stand on the precipice of a holy crusade!"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","Be it true? A daemon resides within the very heart of yon refinery?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_02","Are ye saying even unyielding metal is not beyond the taint of the daemon?"
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","No matter. Where the righteous tread, the wicked be dead."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","This be our calling! Our sacred duty to the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Have faith in the God-Emperor, kindred, and ye'll be delivered from corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_b__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","We enter a pit of corruption. We risk both body and soul..."

"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_04","I am your doom!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_05","I am judgement!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_06","For the Golden Throne!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_07","For Him on Terra!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_08","Your end is nigh!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_09","I am unstoppable!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_10","Emperor guide my hand!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_11","I shall smite you!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_12","There is no forgiveness!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_13","Cast you to hel!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_14","You have been judged!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_maniac_15","Death is a mercy!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_01","I work best in the darkness ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_02","Shadows conceal me ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_03","They will never see me ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_04","Emperor hide me ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_05","Emperor, hide my steps ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_06","I walk far from the light ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_07","In the darkness, I judge ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_08","Heretics are blind to much ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_09","Blind these heretics, I pray ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_10","Unremarked until judgement comes ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_11","Into the darkness ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_12","Beyond the light ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_13","Into shadow. Out of sight."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_14","Emperor walk with me in this shadow ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_pious_stabber_15","The righteous need no light ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_01","Begone!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_02","You are judged!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_03","I judge thee!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_04","I exhort thee!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_05","Begone from my sight!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_06","Beneficent Emperor, hear me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_07","Excoriate the heretic!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_08","Be judged!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_09","No mercy! No remorse!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__ability_repent_a_10","In Terra's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_01","It rises!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_02","Make ready! It is coming!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_03","Have a care..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_04","To arms!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_05","Defend yourselves!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_06","What hel-spawned thing is this?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_07","The Damned thing wakes..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_08","It wakes! What have you done?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_09","No - you fool!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_2_enemy_daemonhost_10","It comes!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_01","Such things are best left untouched..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_02","Let it lie!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_03","Are you trying to wake it?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_04","Too close!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_05","You do not wish to see that thing awaken."
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_06","Leave the creature be."
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_07","Touch it not.."
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_08","Cease!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_09","Step back. It will wake..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__alerted_enemy_daemonhost_10","Fool! Do you want to die?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__almost_there_01","Beneficent Emperor! Is it almost over?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__almost_there_02","Courage, Pilgrims! Our duty is almost done."
"loc_zealot_male_c__almost_there_03","Victory is in our grasp!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__almost_there_04","The Pilgrim's road is long, and rest is welcome."
"loc_zealot_male_c__almost_there_05","Praise the Beneficent Emperor! We are almost done!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_foul_smoke_01","[Cough] The air is full of corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_foul_smoke_02","[Cough] Even the air fights us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_foul_smoke_03","[Cough] We must leave this place before it poisons us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_foul_smoke_04","[Cough] Corruption... in the very air."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_grease_pit_01","Watch your step! Corruption lies beneath."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_grease_pit_02","Beware! The ground is treacherous."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_nurgle_growth_01","Revolting."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_nurgle_growth_02","See, the fruits of corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_nurgle_growth_03","Rotten without, rotten within."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_nurgle_growth_04","Beneficent Emperor preserve us from such rot."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_nurgle_growth_05","Throne-on-Terra. This filth is an abomination."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_sigil_01","I recognise that. The symbol of the Consulate."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_sigil_02","The Atoman Consulate. Much diminished, I see."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_a_01","Our path leads into darkness, Pilgrims."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_a_02","I fear no darkness with Him at my side."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_a_03","The way is dark. Tread with care."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_a_04","What wickedness lies in the darkness ahead?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_01","Wickedness prospers where no light shines."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_02","There is no darkness too great for His light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_03","We must bear His light into the darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__asset_unnatural_dark_b_04","This is no natural darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_01","This way... wait. Where did they go?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_02","Beneficent Emperor, my way is lost."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_03","This battle cannot be fought alone."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_04","I must return to my companions."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_05","The enemy has separated us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_06","I am forsaken, it seems."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_07","Hello? Is there anyone there?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_08","The road of judgement is dark and lonely."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_09","My companions have chosen the path of sin, I see."
"loc_zealot_male_c__away_from_squad_10","Though I walk alone, I walk in His light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_01","Immolation grenade!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_02","Burn, heretics!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_03","Fire grenade!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_04","Loosing flame!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_05","Flame grenade!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_06","Immolation grenade!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_07","Cleansing flame!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_08","The flame that purges!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_09","Ashes and dust!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__blitz_flame_grenade_a_10","Purging flame!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_abandoned_a_01","Has there been no attempt to reclaim Cadia?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_abandoned_c_01","Fear not. There is a worthy cause for you here on Atoma."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_balm_a_01","Ah, the blood! The cries of dying heretics! Is it not a balm for the soul."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_balm_c_01","And some of us are fighting for the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_blessings_a_01","Make no mistake: we are blessed to be called to this war."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_blessings_c_01","You should embrace the Emperor as he embraces you. Find comfort and purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_boot_in_b_01","Indeed we shall, if the God-Emperor wills it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_boot_in_d_01","Rough wisdom is wisdom nonetheless I suppose ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_casting_stones_b_01","Oh, indeed? Were I you I would not cast stones."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_casting_stones_d_01","Once again, I find the description befitting another I might name."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_compliment_b_01","It will be my pleasure, Templar. "
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_compliment_d_01","And so the compliment ebbs away to almost nothing ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_confess_b_01","Gladly, Templar. We all have sins to be shriven."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_confess_d_01","Then stand true, for the foe will come again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_crowds_b_01","Not as such, though the crowds at public exoriations were known to become unruly."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_crowds_d_01","Why, I judged them, of course. With fire ... and malice aforethought."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_dignity_a_01","Oh Beneficent Emperor, grant us the strength to overcome--"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_dignity_c_01","I should hope not. Most undignified."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_even_handed_b_01","I strive to be even-handed in all things. Your failings I see as rough edges to be smoothed away through righteous deeds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_even_handed_d_01","As it should be, for these are not my words, but the wishes of the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_eye_to_eye_a_01","The next time I harry the foe eye-to-eye, I would appreciate a little support."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_eye_to_eye_c_01","That is not what I meant!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_failings_b_01","I have more than I care to express, but I would not make a distraction of them. Not during battle."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_failings_d_01","Yes … Perhaps. I will give the matter careful thought."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_faith_renewed_b_01","And it renews my faith to see a bold soldier of the Militarum repaying the Emperor's trust in blood."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_faith_renewed_d_01","Why not? May the most righteous soul win! ... It will be me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_family_a_01","You know … I almost think of you as family."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_family_c_01","Adopted family, obviously. A charitable case, rescued from the gutter. But family, nonetheless."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_family_e_01","As a boy at the Sanctum Judiceum, I slept on straw."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_fancy_words_b_01","You are a simple soul, easily pleased."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_fancy_words_d_01","Mine, or someone else's? I suppose it matters not."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_final_hours_a_01","I have often wondered what became of Cadia in its final hours."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_final_hours_c_01","The Emperor stood with you to the end."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_fulfilment_a_01","Is there anything to stir the blood like a righteous pilgrimage?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_fulfilment_c_01","Two sides of the same coin! Is not the slaying of heretics in such company a prayerful art?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_funny_look_a_01","Ah, with every heretic slain I feel the God-Emperor’s purpose grow within me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_funny_look_c_01","This? This is the rapturous rictus of a righteous man!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_headshot_extension_vet_b_zea_c_c_01","Fear not, I shall ensure you do not suffer."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_heart_a_01","When were you last on Cadia, Templar?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_heart_c_01","So long as you leave room for the God-Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_hope_falls_a_01","I confess, I feel better about this business knowing a son of Cadia stands with me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_hope_falls_c_01","True enough. What matters is the account we give of ourselves before the inevitable arrives."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_inconstant_b_01","Not so, I doubt. What use is faith if it goes untempered by inconstancy?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_inconstant_d_01","Indeed. The God-Emperor’s light is never brighter than in the darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_innermost_b_01","What? You think to know my innermost thoughts? I am unyielding. Impenetrable!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_innermost_d_01","Then you need hold no fear for me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_killstreak_extension_vet_b_zea_c_d_01","Loud? LOUD? FOR YOU OF ALL PEOPLE TO-- Never mind."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_kindred_soul_a_01","I sense in you a kindred soul, dedicated to the God-Emperor’s works."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_kindred_soul_c_01","I did not speak of trust. But I am … content that we walk the same path."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_legend_a_01","This world shall be but my first pilgrimage of redemption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_legend_c_01","Indeed, for mine is to be a legend fit to shake the stars!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_acceptable_a_01","Serve well and trust to the Beneficent Emperor. He will be our salvation!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_acceptable_c_01","Because it is always true."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aggravate_b_01","Impossible to say. So much of what you say is aggravating."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_aggravate_d_01","You mean ... you do it on purpose?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_arrogance_a_01","To think that we serve so vital a thread in the Beneficent Emperor's tapestry of order. It is most humbling."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_arrogance_c_01","You mistake my passion for arrogance. You are not the first."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_blind_b_01","My thanks. I have striven to be so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_blind_d_01","There are other ways of seeing than with one's eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_crawler_a_01","You may be a brutish oaf, Slab, but you do holy work."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_crawler_c_01","And you do it very well."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_a_01","Would that all of Grendyl's Rejects fought with our dedication."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_c_01","And what do you mean by that?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_dedication_e_01","What a ridiculous question."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_deluded_b_01","I have much about which to be glad. What finer life can there be than the punishment of the deluded?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_deluded_d_01","Ah, but there is an important difference."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_deluded_f_01","They are wrong."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_delusion_b_01","If you must know ... One of the Templars has levelled accusations against me. That I am ... obsessed with her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_delusion_d_01","So you don't believe her? [Sigh] That is some small relief."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_delusion_f_01","You are not helping."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubt_b_01","Then your experience and mine are greatly at odds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_doubt_d_01","Sooner or later you will have to face your fears."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_drowned_a_01","It seems to me that we are spiritual descendants of Confessor Malifax, striving to hold back an apostate tide."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_drowned_c_01","Why, he drowned. "
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_drowned_e_01","In the ocean."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enjoy_b_01","As you should. We perform a holy duty."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_enjoy_d_01","I simply do not know what I'm supposed to say to you ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_entrails_b_01","There is no finer tribute to the Master than an offering of heretic blood. Bathe in its splendour, and rejoice!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_entrails_d_01","It is holy scripture."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_to_eye_a_01","When we next engage, be sparing with your shots. I have the urge to chastise these heretics eye-to-eye."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_eye_to_eye_c_01","The Beneficent Emperor is my shield."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_following_b_01","I go where I am sent, nothing more."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_following_d_01","For Throne's sake woman, I am not following you!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_following_f_01","I-- [Growl] Do we not have heretics to slay?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fun_b_01","For recreation, you mean? Why, I pray, mortify my flesh and hold vigil over the souls in my charge."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_fun_d_01","It would be the making of you, I feel certain."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_glorious_body_a_01","Onwards! The heretics will never defeat us!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_glorious_body_c_01","I speak not of individuals, but the glorious body of faithful souls mustered to Atoma's defence."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_going_to_hel_b_01","Trust to the Beneficent Emperor and he will see us to victory."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_going_to_hel_d_01","Without hesitation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_good_team_a_01","We make for a good team, you and I."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_good_team_c_01","You would, however, do well to remember the virtue of humility."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mood_b_01","I will have you know that many comment upon my mood as inspirational."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_mood_d_01","I ... I have nothing more to add."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_move_within_a_01","You fight well, Freak. The Beneficent Emperor's spirit clearly moves within you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_move_within_c_01","Kindly do not make light of such things."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_noisy_b_01","Hah! This from one who rants and rails with thunderous might."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_noisy_d_01","I must concede the point."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pity_a_01","Do not be ashamed of your dull-wittedness, Slab. The Beneficient Emperor made you thus for a purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pity_c_01","Not at all. I merely wish you to be at ease with yourself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pray_a_01","Do you ever pray to the Beneficent Emperor, Slab?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pray_c_01","Then in this, I shall aid you once the mission is done."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pray_with_zola_b_01","I cannot say that I have ... then again, I am not in the habit of prying into other peoples' thoughts."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_pray_with_zola_d_01","Ah. Perhaps I should offer to pray with her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_psychotic_a_01","Be of good cheer, Freak. We have heretics to slay and little in the way of sanctimonious oversight."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_psychotic_c_01","You say that, but I do not see you holding back."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_puny_b_01","Tis the Beneficent Emperor's blessing that makes you so, Slab."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_puny_d_01","You are His vessel all the same."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purged_a_01","It may yet be that this world must be cleansed by purging flame."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purged_c_01","What was coming?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purged_e_01","I think you meant ""last resort""."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_a_01","No matter how many heretics we slay, there are always more."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_purpose_c_01","I was not complaining. Chastisement grants me purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_shot_at_b_01","I am not afraid to die, if that is what you mean. "
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_shot_at_d_01","But it is wearying to be constantly shot at."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_snappy_a_01","Behold the fruits of heresy: deformity, delusion and damnation!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_snappy_c_01","... No."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_snappy_e_01","That is entirely different!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stomp_b_01","Yes, good Slab! Your bloodlust calls to mine."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_stomp_d_01","It was a figure of speech."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tears_b_01","Sometimes not even at that. At the death of a faithful soul, I might even shed a tear."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tears_d_01","Of course. There is no call for extravagance."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tense_b_01","Who could possibly rest knowing that at any moment Atoma might sink into irretrievable heresy?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_tense_d_01","And that, Freak is why you are damned."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unremitting_a_01","Is this not the life, Slab? Nothing fires the blood like unremitting slaughter!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_unremitting_c_01","Tis the light of righteousness, nothing more!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_victory_a_01","It cannot be long now! Victory is at hand!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_victory_c_01","I did not quite catch that ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_in_my_head_a_01","I have ... known ... many Freaks. You, I think, are different to most."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_voices_in_my_head_c_01","I slay only those the Emperor commands."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_weakling_a_01","Will you fight beside me in the next ambush?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_weakling_c_01","Because ... because I need your help."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wrestle_b_01","I fear I am too busy at this moment, Slab."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_metropolitan_wrestle_d_01","There is ... some truth to your words."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_mourn_a_01","I mourn for Cadia, but the Emperor will never forget its sacrifice."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_mourn_c_01","Perhaps, but even the weak grow strong when need is upon them."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_nature_a_01","Though no Freak is to be entirely trusted, as least you seek to serve the God-Emperor willingly."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_nature_c_01","Well said! If not for your base nature, your words would almost be inspiring."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_obsession_a_01","Be mindful, Templar, that your obsessions do not tempt you into blasphemous ways."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_obsession_c_01","It is said that many arch-heretics started out as righteous folk, but were captured by the sin of pride, or of love for the deed over the purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_opinionated_b_01","As it should be. The God-Emperor sent me here to provide succour to the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_opinionated_d_01","Of course! What could lift the spirits more than a righteous bloodletting?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_perfectist_a_01","Fear not, Templar! I shall stand by you!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_perfectist_c_01","Where was this streak of perfectionism in our last fire fight?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_pleasing_screams_b_01","And you ... certainly have a creative method of dispatching heretics?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_pleasing_screams_d_01","But effective, nonetheless. It illicits most pleasing screams."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_pretty_words_a_01","You are a most unruly companion, Templar."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_pretty_words_c_01","Yes ... Unruly, and vexing."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_remembrance_a_01","Should I fall in battle, remember me well."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_remembrance_c_01","Unswerving faith resonates with others. It is a phenomenon well-recorded."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_reward_one_day_a_01","Remember! The heretics are many and we few, but our trials will one day be rewarded!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_reward_one_day_c_01","Indeed, but is death too not a reward, if earned striving against the God-Emperor’s foes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_booming_b_01","... Thank you, Slab, that's very ... kind. And you ..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_booming_d_01","Erm ... You have a deep booming voice too."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_creed_b_01","Why yes! Indeed, truth is at the heart of everything we do."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_creed_d_01","The Beneficent Emperor's truth. There is no other worth heeding."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_deaf_b_01","Slab, you are shouting. I fear the explosion may have deafened you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_deeds_a_01","After weighty consideration, I have concluded it is rashness to judge Psykers merely for possessing a base nature. "
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_deeds_c_01","Deeds should matter more, and by your deeds I shall judge you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_dignity_a_01","Comport yourself with dignity, Freak. We represent something far greater than ourselves."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_dignity_c_01","Perhaps. The Beneficent Emperor moves us in mysterious ways."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_musk_b_01","Powerful enough to make aerocraft fall out of the sky."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_pretext_b_01","That is base slander! Never once have I slain the righteous."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_pretext_d_01","Why, the Beneficent Emperor ... and his truest servants."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_pretext_f_01","... I tire of this conversation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_05_a_01","I still do not trust you, Freak."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_psyker_peril_05_c_01","Your prattle is a shield against your fears. Do not think I do not see it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_relax_b_01","Relax? RELAX? Could you relax knowing that at any moment the weight of mankind's sins could become too much for the Beneficent Emperor to bear?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_seat_a_01","Slab! I haven't forgotten you stole my seat on the Storm Raptor!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_seat_c_01","Charlatan! The servo-skull cannot speak!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_smart_a_01","Forgive me Slab, but you seem very intelligent for one of your kind. "
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_smart_c_01","I take it back."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_smart_e_01","Do I have a choice?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_travails_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor knows that travails are better faced in good company than alone."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_round_three_travails_d_01","Lead the way and I shall follow!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_scoring_a_01","Heretics are near. I am certain of it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_scoring_c_01","Meaning?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_screaming_lungs_a_01","Beneficent Emperor, that last heretic nearly took my head!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_screaming_lungs_c_01","Must you treat everything as a joke?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_shooting_back_b_01","That is, of course, basically obvious."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_shooting_back_d_01","Yes, it would appear you are living proof."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_smear_b_01","Hah! Let the heretics assail me if they dare, for is mine not the strength of the God-Emperor?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_smear_d_01","I care not for your imagery. It is ... unbecoming."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_spy_proof_b_01","Yes! Perhaps there is a spy in our midst."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_spy_proof_d_01","... There may be some truth in that also."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_talking_b_01","Then you have kept poor company. Holiness is born in slaughter."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_talking_d_01","Yes. And that is where you go astray."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_tarry_not_a_01","Walk with me into the fray, Templar! Let us vanquish these heretics together!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_tarry_not_c_01","Then try, for the righteous tarry not when their blood boils with hate!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_vainglory_b_01","I would never succumb to such vainglory. It would be unbecoming for one of my standing."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_vainglory_d_01","Do you not have heretics to kill?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_waste_not_a_01","You have only one life! Offer it to the God-Emperor and it shall not be wasted."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_waste_not_c_01","Not so! How else would you explain the existence of heretics?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_whining_a_01","Alas that I find myself surrounded by such petty, tiny souls."
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_whining_c_01","What is that whining sound?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__bonding_conversation_whining_e_01","There it is again. I should have Krall check my ears for … mites."
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_01","Help!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_02","Help!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_03","I cannot defeat them alone!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_04","Companions! Aid me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_05","Help me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_06","By the throne, help!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_07","Beneficent Emperor, grant me your aid!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_08","Help me, in the Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_09","They are upon me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__calling_for_help_10","Quick! I cannot hold them for long!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_enemy_over_here_01","Enemy spotted!"

"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_thank_you_03","Thank you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_thank_you_04","Thank you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_thank_you_05","My thanks!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_thank_you_06","My thanks!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_01","Of course!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_02","Of course!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_03","Agreed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_04","Agreed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_05","Let it be so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__com_wheel_vo_yes_06","Let it be so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_hound_b_01","A trained beast, a beast remains. One need look no further than some of our fellows."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_a_hound_b_02","It would only be a distraction, Slab. Focus on your duty."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor shall guide our aim."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_ogryn_b_gas_b_02","Trust to the Beneficent Emperor, Slab. He shall guide us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_01","I will give the matter due consideration, should it arise."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_a_hound_b_02","Your request is noted, and carefully filed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_01","Faith always manages. See that yours is strong."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_psyker_b_gas_b_02","We shall prevail if we hold true to the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_01","Be glad it is only a mortal cur that hunts us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_a_hound_b_02","At least a mortal hound can be slain. There are daemonkind that cannot."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_01","Let it be so! I prefer to see the light fade from a heretic's eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_veteran_b_gas_b_02","It is for the best. A righteous soul without bloody hand is not truly righteous."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_01","I did not expect such compassion from you, Guardian. Much less for it to be so misplaced."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_a_hound_b_02","Is that sympathy? A rare weakness from you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_01","Do you expect a comforting lie? Or a bitter truth? I offer neither."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_b_gas_b_02","The time for such concerns was on the valkyrie."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_gas_a_01","Calm yourselves pilgrims, this is merely fog. It will offer no harm."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_gas_a_02","Quieten your concerns. This fog offers us no harm."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_a_01","Pay heed to the baying, pilgrims. It is a sure sign that a Hound is close!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_circumstance_zealot_c_hound_a_02","Hounds, like heretics, cannot help but to announce their presence. Heed the warning!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_01_b_01","Having seen you shoot, I am inclined to agree."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_04_b_01","Your ""job"" is to serve the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_07_b_01","Breaking into quarters is also acceptable."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_12_b_01","We shall cleanse it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_16_b_01","When you can be trusted to aim the one you have."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_a_17_b_01","There are things out there far worse than you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_01_b_01","You'll get your medal, Slab. When you're done."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_02_b_01","Or you could do your job properly the first time, perhaps."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_05_b_01","Easy? [out of breath] I would hate to see what you consider difficult."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_11_b_01","They will not mess twice."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_18_b_01","We're all safer when you're not firing a gun."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_b_20_b_01","Slab, wait... Is he already asleep?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_02_b_01","Follow them well, Brute, for the Imperium and Mankind!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_06_b_01","Why must I suffer your companionship?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_10_b_01","I am not surprised."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_14_b_01","You are a delicate creature indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_18_b_01","No matter, so long as your thoughts are filled with purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_ogryn_c_19_b_01","Throne preserve us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_06_b_01","You can complain, or you can help cleanse it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_07_b_01","If thousand souls cry out for vengeance, you must answer."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_09_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor has a plan for you, Psyker. Remember that."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_13_b_01","Then use this time to gather your strength for the fight to come."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_a_14_b_01","Shirk not from the path ordained for you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_06_b_01","Nothing about this is right. Especially the way you talk of your ""beloved""."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_07_b_01","When will you learn this is no dream?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_09_b_01","You come dangerously close to heresy, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_13_b_01","Ignore the Psyker. More nonsense."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_b_14_b_01","However did he reach that conclusion?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_07_b_01","Duty would not have forgotten you. Trust to that."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_11_b_01","Familiarity invites temptation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_15_b_01","There is a higher law even than the Lex Atoma."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_psyker_c_19_b_01","I have discipline fit to shatter mountains. Training will attend to itself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_01_b_01","Only those who have nowhere left to be."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_04_b_01","[laughing] I feel better already."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_07_b_01","Beneficent Emperor give me strength..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_12_b_01","Oh, I am keeping score, Templar."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_16_b_01","Take strength from your past. Use it to build a better future."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_a_17_b_01","You should be glad I have not brought the laud-hailers."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_01_b_01","Be grateful for another chance to serve."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_04_b_01","I am glad to see you enjoy this holy work."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_07_b_01","What exactly would we be learning?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_12_b_01","Oh, you are observed, Templar. Have no fear of that."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_16_b_01","I am ready to die, if that is what He has ordained."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_b_17_b_01","Yes. Are you sure it is your uniform?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_01_b_01","Indeed, pilgrim. In the striving we find purpose!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_05_b_01","Your example is an inspiration. See that it remains so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_09_b_01","We fight to our last breath. The Beneficent Emperor demands it!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_13_b_01","All will unfold as the Beneficent Emperor wills."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_veteran_c_17_b_01","My eyes are open, have no fear."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_06_b_01","Rest not while there is work to be done."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_07_b_01","Great is the mind too small for doubt!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_09_b_01","Well said, Pilgrim!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_13_b_01","Pray, and He will give you strength!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_a_14_b_01","There is only righteous judgement."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_02_b_01","I am not afraid."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_06_b_01","Beneficent Emperor, make me the channel of your vengeance!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_07_b_01","I am with you, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_09_b_01","He will not find us lacking."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_13_b_01","Pray, and He will give you courage."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_b_14_b_01","Abhor the heretic and the mutant!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_01_a_01","We have a moment. Who will lead us in prayer?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_02_a_01","The heretics cannot stand against our faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_a_01","Fear is a weapon of the enemy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_03_b_01","Then let us turn it against them!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_04_a_01","Zeal shall be your greatest weapon!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_05_a_01","Our greatest reward shall be righteousness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_06_a_01","Beneficent Emperor deliver us..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_07_a_01","A swift end is all the mercy these heretics deserve."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_07_b_01","Then let us be merciful!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_08_a_01","If we are to die today, it shall be by the Emperor's will."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_09_a_01","I am not afraid."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_10_a_01","Through pain our souls are cleansed..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_11_a_01","I pray that when they come, our deaths are favourable in the Beneficent Emperor's sight."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_11_b_01","All deaths in his service are worthy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_12_a_01","The heresy on Atoma has kindled a great wrath in me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_13_a_01","I am the Beneficent Emperor's fiery sword!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_14_a_01","Follow me and I will guide your way."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_15_a_01","I am with you, fellow Pilgrims."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_15_b_01","And we with you, Guardian."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_16_a_01","All is as the Beneficent Emperor has ordained."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_17_a_01","The Beneficent Emperor will not find us lacking."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_18_a_01","Take a moment. Find comfort in prayer."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_19_a_01","We will show these heretics the might of the Beneficent Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_19_b_01","Let us smite them in his Holy Name!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_limited_zealot_c_20_a_02","Fear not, the Beneficent Emperor has ordained the hour of your death."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_01","Have no fear, Pilgrims! We are righteous!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_02","Warriors of the Beneficent Emperor, we shall prevail!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_03","In battle shall we scourge the sins of our mortal flesh!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_04","Quail, heretics! The hour of judgement is at hand!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_05","The Beneficent Emperor has sent us to cleanse this place!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_06","Beneficent Emperor, bless this holy work!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_07","Bear witness to the rewards of sin!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_08","See, Pilgrims! Our righteousness has been rewarded!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_09","We have achieved much, but there is more still to do."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_one_liner_10","Beneficent Emperor, this slaughter is my offering to you!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_01","Have faith. You are as the Beneficent Emperor intended you to be."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_abhuman_b_02","""Human"" is the important part of the word."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_01","I trust the Beneficent Emperor to guide my hand."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_accuracy_b_02","Pah. To aim would be to doubt the Emperor's plan."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_01","Your zeal transcends your aim, I fear."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_b_02","Another cursed weapon. Who would have believed it?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_01","How much ammunition can a single pilgrim require?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_02","Is your aim so bad you require all the ammunition?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_a_03","Might I petition you for some ammunition? If you have anything to spare, that is."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_01","Put it to good use, then."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ammo_hog_b_02","On this occasion my zeal exceeded my judgement. My contrition."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_01","Have you both eaten and slept of late, Pilgrim?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_anger_b_02","We shall soon find a righteous war to distract you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_01","Then pray for guidance, Psyker. And for His mercy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bad_feeling_b_02","Do you ever have a good feeling?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_01","You are as the Beneficent Emperor made you. Be content."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bone_ead_b_02","How would we tell the difference?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_01","Perhaps a moment... to catch my breath."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bored_b_02","There will be more to kill before long."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_01","You are truly made for war."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_bullets_tickle_b_02","In that regard at least I envy you, Slab."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_01","All proceeds according to His divine plan."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cheerful_b_02","At least one of us is happy, then."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_01","I prefer a cleansing flame myself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_club_thump_b_02","It matters not how the heretics perish, only that they die."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_01","Are you so eager for the Pyre?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_cold_b_02","My faith keeps me warm. You should try it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_01","Throne help us. What were you like before?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_competence_b_02","Yield not to vainglory, Psyker. That way lies corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_01","Your empty words mean nothing to me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_concerning_enforcers_b_02","How fortunate we are that the Psyker is here to advise us on the path of righteousness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_01","I do not fear death in the Emperor's service."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_already_b_02","There are worse fates than death."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_01","Concern yourself with the living, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dead_b_02","Silence, unless you wish to join them."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_01","A worthy example for you to follow."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_deddog_b_02","Strive for greatness, and perhaps your legend will exceed his."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_01","Courage, Pilgrim. We are at your side."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_defend_b_02","All is as the Beneficent Emperor ordains."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_01","I will pretend I did not hear that."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_desert_b_02","There is only a small step from treachery to heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_01","Turn your strength to the task at hand."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_disappointment_b_02","Then we must ensure our efforts are enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_01","Perhaps you should have brought more proper soldiers then."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_discipline_b_02","As long as you agree to follow my lead when it comes to matters of faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_01","I like them well enough. At the correct distance."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dislikes_grenades_b_02","They are a useful tool. Like you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_01","Then we must make ourselves a bulwark against the flames."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_doomed_b_02","Have courage, Pilgrim. All is according to the Beneficent Emperor's design."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_01","This is no dream, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_dream_b_02","Mouth is open, Psyker. Should be closed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_01","When the battle is done, we will toast victory together."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_drink_b_02","This place would turn anyone to drink."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_01","He watches over us all, Templar."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_emperor_b_02","Well said, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_01","Then we will fight till the end."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_end_b_02","Have faith, Pilgrim. All is not yet lost."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_01","We must cut out this sickness before it spreads yet further."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_b_02","The enemy has much to answer for."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_01","We were not made for peace."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_endless_war_b_02","There can be no peace while a single threat to humanity remains."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_01","We are all known to the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_expendable_b_02","Then we should ensure our lives are spent dearly."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_01","Think of the suffering of the martyrs. That will give you strength."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_feet_b_02","Stop complaining!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_01","Fire is an instrument, like any other. Do not be blinded by its light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_flame_b_02","True enough, in the right place."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_01","Take a moment. Pray for guidance."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_forgetful_b_02","Killing, Slab. You're here for killing."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_01","Have a care, Psyker. Remember in whose company you stand."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_fractal_b_02","All is as the Beneficent Emperor ordained it. Have faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_01","Perhaps the Inquisitor knows his work after all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_friends_b_02","I am glad to fight at your side."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_01","When we run out of rations, I shall know who to blame."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_glutton_b_02","Filling your belly cannot satisfy the needs of your soul."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_01","We will grant them the Emperor's mercy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hates_poxwalkers_b_02","May the Beneficent Emperor spare us from such a fate."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_01","That might have saved a life. Instead it healed a scratch."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_02","A little more courage, Pilgrim? Surely that wound did not need tending."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_a_03","Perhaps you should spend more time in flagellation if that wound pained you so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_01","A wound left untreated may easily fester."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_health_hog_b_02","Best not to wait for the rot to set in."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor is family and home to us all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_homesick_b_02","Perhaps you will see it again one day."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_a_01","Join me in a hymn, Pilgrims! [sung] ""My eyes have seen his glory..."" [trails off] Anyone?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_a_02","My soul swells with holy song! Who will join me?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_a_03","Bring out your hymnals, Pilgrims! Let us glorify him in song!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_01","When this mission is done, Guardian, we will raise a song to shake the heavens."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_hymnal_b_02","There is a time for song, Guardian, but that time is not now."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_01","They will come in time. Gather your strength for now."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_impatient_b_02","[laughing] All things in good time, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_01","This battle is far from over."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_killing_stopped_b_02","Gather your strength, Slab. They will come soon enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_01","Merciful throne."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_leader_b_02","Certainly. We shall hang on your every word."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_01","All the more reason to strive ardently for peace."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_local_knowledge_b_02","Perhaps those days of plenty will come again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_01","[sigh] Beneficent Emperor. Why do you test me so?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_lonely_b_02","Please. Not this again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_01","All shall be judged!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_merciless_b_02","For the Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_01","Do not speak to me of Saint Messelina, Freak! Her holy name should burn your lips!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_messelina_b_02","The blessed saint! Long have I wished to rest my eyes on her gilded remains."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_01","You will have respect when you have earned it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nicer_b_02","You make my flesh creep, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_01","So perish all who reject His light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_nostalgia_b_02","Quite the cautionary tale."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_01","I see no problem with this."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_bigger_gun_b_02","Certainly. What could possibly go wrong?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_01","The idiot has a point."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_ogryn_a_elevator_b_02","Can this device even bear the Ogryn's weight?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_a_01","A Pilgrim's duty is arduous, but your rewards shall be great."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_a_02","The Beneficent Emperor has not forgotten you, Pilgrims. He sees your service."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_a_03","You are weary, Pilgrims, I know, but your deeds are known to Him."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_01","I am glad to bleed in His service."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pilgrimage_b_02","I shall be faithful unto death."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_a_01","Who will lead us in a prayer of thanksgiving?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_a_02","Give thanks to the Beneficent Emperor! Who will begin?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_a_03","Praise be to the Beneficent Emperor! Who will be first to offer their thanks?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_01","Praise be, he has shown us his favour!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_pray_with_me_b_02","Beneficent Emperor, with all my heart I praise thee!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_01","There will be time for prayers when this is done."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_prayer_b_02","Let us bow our heads in silent reverence."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_01","Strength is not always measured in muscle, Slab."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_puny_b_02","We are all as the Beneficent Emperor has made us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_01","Be thankful for what you have."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_rations_b_02","Who will join me in a prayer of thanks? Anyone...?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_01","I assure you, I think nothing that I have not said to your face."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_reads_thoughts_b_02","Use your arts against the enemy, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_01","You were not made for wisdom, Slab."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_respect_b_02","Blessed is the mind too small for doubt."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_01","May it rise from the flames."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_restore_b_02","All will be according to His will."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_01","No rest for the wicked, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_shore_leave_b_02","To enjoy all the delights of this world? I think not."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_01","I have the very hymnal! Does anyone know  ""The Blessings of His Holy Scourge?"""
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sing_b_02","I will sing with you, Templar, when this is over."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_01","Did we forget to bring the recaff again?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sleepy_b_02","Perhaps a grox-prod is called for..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_01","Then we shall give them a coward's death."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_sniper_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor has ordained their death. Cowardice will not save them."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_01","Death! Death to the enemies of the Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_speed_b_02","Come, Pilgrims! To Holy war!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_01","Stealth is the coward's way."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stealth_b_02","Ha. Battle is a hymn! It should be loud!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_01","Look to your own stench before you criticise that of others!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_stench_b_02","Fill your nostrils with holy unguents, then no stench can bother you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_01","Think of the holy destruction that we could wreak!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tank_b_02","With a flamer? Could we have a heavy flamer?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_01","Aye, a beacon that tempts righteous souls to wickedness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_tertium_splendour_b_02","I assume you have never been offworld, Psyker?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_01","A prayer group! I shall begin preparations immediately."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_togetherness_b_02","I am glad to provide whatever spiritual guidance you require."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor sees all, and has sent us to judge them."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_traitor_b_02","Turn your mind to prayer, and you shall not fall."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_01","Only the Emperor's judgement matters, and He sees your worth."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trial_b_02","You are where the Beneficent Emperor intends. Do his work."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_01","I would gladly trade for any holy artefacts you find."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trinket_b_02","Waging holy war is expensive. We should offset those costs where we can."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_01","If you can trust no one else, trust in the Beneficent Emperor, and he will sustain you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_trust_b_02","I wonder what dark event of your past so shattered your faith in your fellows."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_01","Watch as you please, Templar. I will gladly die before I break my oaths."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_turncoat_b_02","I stand ready to scourge the oathbreaker and the unbeliever."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_01","We are only following your professional example."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_veteran_a_professional_b_02","I am wounded to the quick.."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_01","Not while we have breath to serve."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_victory_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor has commanded us to win or die."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_01","Rest assured I will attend to the matter when we have a moment's peace."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_weapons_b_02","My weapon bears the marks of heavy use. Unlike some others I could mention."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_a_01","Who has a sin to confess? Come, Pilgrims, lighten your souls!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_a_02","We have a moment to shrive our souls. Unburden yourselves of your sins!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_a_03","Who amongst us is without sin? Speak of your failings, Pilgrims, and ask His forgiveness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_01","I have pitied the heretic when I should have hated. Mercy must not temper our wrath."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_your_sins_b_02","My sins are great. But his forgiveness is infinite, if we only serve."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_01","Fear nought, for He is with us!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_emperor_b_02","In slaughter shall we praise him!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_01","Quiet, Guardian. You are making us look bad."
"loc_zealot_male_c__combat_pause_quirk_zealot_a_wounded_b_02","The Emperor grants you strength, despite your grievous wounds!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_01","The way is too dark to walk alone."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_02","Where are you going?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_03","Keep close. Danger awaits."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_04","We are safest together, Pilgrims."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_05","Do not stray from His light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_06","Do not leave the path He has ordained."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_07","We must stay together."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_08","Alone we will fail."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_09","Do not be distracted from the way."
"loc_zealot_male_c__come_back_to_squad_10","Return, at once!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_01_01","I pray that the Emperor in his wisdom sends his daughters to cleanse this place."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_one_03_01","Test me, God Emperor. I am ready."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_01_01","What is this ""Cicatrix Maledictum""? The very words are laced with corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_40k_lore_two_03_01","The greater the darkness, the greater the opportunity to bring His holy light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_experienced_one_01_01","I have never seen a place so much in need of cleansing fire."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_rookie_one_01_01","I should have liked to see this place in its new-built glory."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_atoma_lore_veteran_one_01_01","The sinners here speak of a second hive city here on Atoma. As if one pit of sin was not enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_01","Destroy the abomination!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_a_02","The Beast must die! It must!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_01","It cannot guard against blows from behind!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_b_02","It is weaker in the back! Strike there!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_01","Indeed! You speak truth!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_beast_of_nurgle_weakpoint_c_02","Of course! Let the abomination perish!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_01","I see the Explicator has dispensed with courtesy for the sake of brevity."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_a_02","I am tired of Explicator Zola's disrespect. We are all here to do the Emperor's bidding."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_01","I do not need honeyed words to recognise the Emperor's truth."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_b_02","I fear her pride may presage a fall."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_01","I shall reserve judgement. For now."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_one_c_02","Let her be judged according to her deeds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_01","The Explicator once called this world home. That explains much."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_a_02","Explicator Zola has ties to this place. Whether that is blessing or curse remains to be seen."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_01","Interesting. What other secrets does her past hold?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_explicator_two_b_02","And yet she speaks little of it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_01","We are in safe hands with our pilot. She is guided by the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_02","Faith guides our pilot. I am much comforted by this."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_03","Take comfort. Our pilot is a pious woman."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_01_04","Thank the Emperor. Our pilot is one of the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_01","Do you see? She shared with me this holy relic, the fingernail of Saint Andreikov of Velquis."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_02","She can be trusted. No heretic would carry the knucklebone of Saint Imogene the Bloody."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_03","She is true in faith. See, she gave me a copy of the Blessed Canticle of Saint Alicia's wrath!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_03_04","She is one of us, truly. See, she entrusted me with the holy ocule of Redemptor Carmillia!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_01","Faith shines in unexpected places."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_four_04_02","We are lucky to have found such a faithful servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_01","What do you make of our pilot, Pilgrims?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_01_02","I must confess, I have questions regarding the diligence of our pilot."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_01","I shall watch her with care."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_02_02","I will reserve judgement... for now."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_01","We are all in the Beneficent Emperor's hands."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_one_03_02","We are safe in the Emperor's hands. Even if the Pilot seems...unpredictable."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_01","[sigh] Go on then. What is it?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_02_02","Waste no more time, Psyker. Out with it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_01","[laughs] An impressive feat."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_three_04_02","[laughs] My opinion of her has risen."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_01","What troubles you, Pilgrim? Confession will ease your soul."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_01_02","Is it sin or sorrow that weighs on your soul, Pilgrim?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_01","Gambling [Sigh] Take it as a learning experience."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_pilot_two_03_02","Learn from the lesser sin, Pilgrim, lest you commit a greater one."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_01","Fall abomination! You shall not pass!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_01_02","Beneficent Emperor! It will not die!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_01","The head! Aim for the head!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_02_02","Smite the head! Scatter its feeble wits!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_01","Hah! We shall best this foe yet!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_plague_ogryn_weakpoint_03_02","Of course! I was about the suggest the same!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_01","It is good to remember the martyrs."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_02_02","Perhaps I should speak with him. Grief is a heavy burden."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_01","May he find solace in duty."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_four_03_02","May the Beneficent Emperor grant him peace."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_01","The sergeant is troubled today, and seeks to trouble us in turn."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_01_02","I see the sergeant is troubled today."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_01","The mantle of leadership weight heavily on his shoulders."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_02_02","The Emperor gives no one a burden they cannot bear."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_01","I will seek him out and offer him the comfort of faith. Once he is a little calmer, perhaps."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_one_03_02","I will pray for him."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_01","Tell me more of this Xanatros..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_02_02","What happened?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_01","Xenos horribilis. How did he survive such horrors?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_three_04_02","A feat to have survived such a war. Perhaps he had powerful allies even then."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_01","There was a Morrow fought at Armageddon, but surely it is not the same man."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_01_02","Morrow seems older than his years. I find myself wondering what sights his eyes have seen."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_01","It is not only faith that can sustain a body beyond its allotted span of years."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_02_02","Perhaps an unnatural force sustains him."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_01","May he fill his long years with righteous deeds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_sergeant_two_03_02","Even a long life can be brought to a swift end. He is in the Emperor's hands."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_01","I do not know what to make of our Tech-Priest."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_a_02","The Tech-Priest seems strange, even for a member of the Cult of Mars."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_01","Can that body of cogs and pistons even be called human?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_b_02","She is a different kind of priest. One I do not understand."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_01","So long as she serves the Emperor, I care not for her eccentricities."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_tech_priest_one_c_02","She is strange, but I see no reason to mistrust her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_01","Fear not, Pilgrims. The God Emperor demands our service, and will not find us lacking."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_02","A crusade awaits us, Pilgrims. Take courage, and know the worth of your deeds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_03","All is as the Beneficent Emperor ordains. You are in his hands, Pilgrims."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_01_04","The Emperor has ordained the day and hour of our deaths, Pilgrims. If it is today, rejoice!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_01","There are no sins so great that a soul cannot be redeemed. Even yours, sinner."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_02","The Emperor knows your worth, even when you do not see it yourself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_03","The time of judgement is at hand. Do not be found wanting."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_one_03_04","All is as it should be. He sees all and knows all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_01","Trust in the Beneficent Emperor, and He will deliver you!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_02","Courage, Pilgrims! All is according to the Beneficent Emperor's plan."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_03","Remember that you are the Beneficent Emperor's will made flesh."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_01_04","The Beneficent Emperor has not forsaken us, even now."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_01","The Emperor knows you, even those of you who are blind to him."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_02","I will remember you to Him in my prayers."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_03","May you one day behold His radiance. Of course, you'll be dead by then."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_three_03_04","Pray diligently, and your faith shall only grow."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_01","Remember, our truest prayers are found in action, not empty words."
"loc_zealot_male_c__conversation_zealot_two_02_02","Forgive me, Guardian. Could you try again in simpler language?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__cover_me_01","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__cover_me_02","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__cover_me_03","Cover me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__cover_me_05","Cover me, now!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__cover_me_07","Beneficent Emperor!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__cover_me_09","You have been given a weapon -- use it!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__cover_me_10","In His name, cover me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_01","I am... wounded..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_02","Have mercy on Your dying servant..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_03","I am called to judgement."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_04","The wound is deep."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_05","The light... is fading..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_06","Forgive me, I have failed you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_07","Beneficent Emperor, why have you forsaken me?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_08","I fear my journey is close to its end..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_09","Pray for me when I am gone..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__critical_health_10","The pain... the pain..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__cs_prologue_five_05_01","I was dead anyway."
"loc_zealot_male_c__cs_prologue_three_04_01","I did."
"loc_zealot_male_c__cs_prologue_two_16_01","This is a mistake. I am a loyal servant of the Throne."
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_01","Help!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_02","Help me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_03","It is upon me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_04","The beast has me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_05","It's biting me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_06","It has me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_07","Kill the thrice-damned thing!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_08","Kill it!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_09","The beast! Kill it!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_chaos_hound_10","Get it off me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_01","I am held fast!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_02","I cannot move!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_03","Free me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_04","Beneficent Emperor, free your servant!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_05","Set me free!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_06","Why are you waiting? Free me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_07","What is keeping you? Free me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_08","Set me loose!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_09","Free me!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__disabled_by_enemy_10","I cannot fight like this!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_01","The Rager lies slain!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_02","So perish all who choose Fury over Faith!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_03","Another Rager sent to hel!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_04","The Rager is cleansed!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_05","Another Rager dead!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_06","Behold, another slain Rager!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_07","Your Rage was not enough!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_08","Face judgement, Rager!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_09","Die, Rager!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_10","The Rager is delivered to judgement."
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_03_b_01","A blow well struck, pilgrims!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_berserker_ext_03_d_01","Silence! I shall offer praise where I see fit."
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_01","Die, beast!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_02","The Hound is destroyed!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_03","Face judgement, Hel Hound!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_04","Your fangs will snap no more, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_05","The beast is slain!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_06","Silence, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_07","Face your maker, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_08","Now you die, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_09","Die, Dog!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_chaos_hound_10","Perish, Hound!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_daemonhost_01","So perish all such abominations!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_daemonhost_02","The Daemonhost is slain!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_daemonhost_03","The Daemonhost is rendered unto judgement!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_daemonhost_04","To the Throne with you, Daemonhost!"

"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_daemonhost_06","Praise be, the Daemonhost is cleansed!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_daemonhost_07","A merciful end, Daemonhost!"

"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_mutant_charger_01","A merciful death for this Mutant."
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_mutant_charger_02","Cleanse this place, one Mutant at a time!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_mutant_charger_03","Death is too good for you, Mutant!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__enemy_kill_mutant_charger_04","Take your corruption from this place, Mutant!"

"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_02","The Astra Militarum have preachers amongst their ranks. I do not envy them the task of bringing faith to the faithless."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_03","Without the preachers who serve the Astra Militarum, surely the whole imperial army would fall to corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_a_04","As a child, I longed to serve as a Chaplain of the Astra Militarum, but I have since seen the error of my ways."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_01","A difficult calling indeed. A life of privation, endured for the Beneficent Emperor's sake."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_b_02","It cannot be easy to provide spiritual guidance to the spiritually deficient."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_01","Unless the pay is truly excellent, I have no intention of volunteering myself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_astra_militarum_two_c_02","Even the most recalcitrant grox can be led, given enough food and a heavy stick. The same I believe is true of Guardsmen."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_four_b_01","If they make war on the Enemies of Humanity, I am content."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_four_b_02","If she bears a Warrant of Trade, then surely she is no pirate."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_four_c_01","The past is behind us all. I will judge her deeds as I see them."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_four_c_02","Do not allow your judgement to be tainted by rumour and speculation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_one_b_01","Her duty is a shackle about her neck. She will learn to bear it, or it will break her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_one_b_02","This way of life seems strange to her. I trust she will learn, and swiftly."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_one_c_01","I will pray for her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_one_c_02","Another of our companions who would benefit from the touch of the scourge."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_three_b_01","She bears a heavy responsibility. Or is it guilt?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_three_b_02","Brahms is keeping secrets. A dangerous thing."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_three_c_01","We are stuck with her regardless. But tread carefully."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_three_c_02","I will pray for guidance, and for her soul's salvation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_a_01","I mistrust the Rogue Trader. As I would any who treat with Xenos."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_a_02","A lifetime trading with the foul Xenos has left a stain on Brahms."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_a_03","Brahms claims loyalty to the Imperium, but she has profited from trading with Xenos."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_a_04","Have a care around Brahms, Pilgrims. She has dealt with Xenos, and cannot be trusted."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_b_01","I agree, but speak carefully. Who knows if she can hear us?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_b_02","Hush. This conversation might better be had in private."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_c_01","We are commanded to abhor the xenos with good reason."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_brahms_two_c_02","Even if she has profited by these dealings, it is to her soul's detriment."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_four_b_01","They worship a plague daemon, and are punished for their blasphemy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_four_c_01","Who would serve such a master? Only the truly damned."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_four_c_02","Servants of the Plague Lord. They serve the very antithesis of life and purity."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_one_b_01","There is but one God. Place your trust in him and be saved."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_one_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor is the one true God."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_one_c_01","These false Gods offer much, but deliver only damnation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_one_c_02","See what becomes of those who accept the gifts of the false gods. Madness and corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_three_b_01","Surely the Emperor would not allow such a place to exist."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_three_b_02","If it were real, no human mind could comprehend it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_three_c_01","A virtuous mind does not dwell on such things."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_three_c_02","Think no more of such things. That way corruption lies."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_a_01","I have heard it whispered that even the Blessed Astartes can fall to Chaos. Surely it is not so?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_a_02","Do you think it is possible that the Enemy has Space Marines of its own?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_a_03","Surely the Blessed Adeptus Astartes are too pure to be tempted by the wiles of the enemy...?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_a_04","I have heard of warriors of Chaos, like Space Marines but foul and corrupted."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_b_01","Even to think of such things would be heresy!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_b_02","If the Blessed Sons of the Emperor can fall, what hope remains for the rest of us?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_c_01","Think no more on this. That way lies only corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_chaos_two_c_02","I recommend we never speak of this to the Inquisitor. In fact, best we do not speak at all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_four_b_01","The great scar that lights the sky over Cadia. An abomination, a tear in the nature of reality itself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_four_b_02","It is a gateway between the Warp and our reality. It is exactly as bad as that sounds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_four_c_01","The Eye of Terror was the doom of Cadia. If the Empire's finest can fall, what hope for us?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_four_c_02","No good can come of it. If only that eye might be closed for good, but how?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_one_b_01","Be ever vigilant. Foulness hides in the most unexpected of places."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_one_b_02","That's what they want you to think."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_one_c_01","Keep your weapons close, and your scriptures closer."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_one_c_02","The enemies of the faithful are everywhere. Be on your guard."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_three_b_01","I would not let you suffer such a fate for long."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_three_b_02","It is only a matter of time before your true nature is revealed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_three_c_01","Remember, the ways of the enemy are subtle. Watch the Psyker always for signs of taint."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_three_c_02","Be vigilant, Pilgrims. Should the Psyker fall to chaos, your very souls may depend upon it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_a_01","Sometimes I wonder what hope there is for the future, if even the Lion's Gate is not safe from Daemonkind."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_a_02","Be like the Lion's Gate, Pilgrims. Though assailed by Daemons, it stood fast."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_a_03","These are the days that try our souls. That we should live to see the Lion's Gate assailed by Daemons!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_a_04","I have heard dark tidings, that Daemonkind assaulted the Lion's Gate itself!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_b_01","The Beneficent Emperor's light still shines. There is no force that can extinguish it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_b_02","Praise be to the defenders of Holy Terra. Without them, all might have been lost."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_c_01","May those responsible know the full weight of the Emperor's judgement!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_daemons_two_c_02","I shall pray for those who fell in its defence. Blessed martyrs, every one of them."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_b_02","He is the Sacred Godhead given flesh, both God and Man entwined."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_01","When did you all become experts on the nature of the divine?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_four_c_02","He is  by his nature unknowable. Cease your speculation, and turn your mind to worship."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_01","The blessed sisters have better things to do than saving your miserable hide."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_b_02","Whine louder, and surely they will come."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_01","If the Sisters arrive, we shall know things have gone badly wrong."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_one_c_02","Perhaps if we fail the Sisters will be sent to cleanse all that remains."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_01","Praise be to the Missionaria, bringers of the Beneficent Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_b_02","They should be commended most highly, for the fulfillment of their most sacred duty."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_01","""For every grox returned to the fold, the grox-herd rejoices. So the Emperor longs to see each world restored to his light."""
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_three_c_02","One day I hope to join the Missionaria and bear His word into the void."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_01","It is my dearest wish to receive the commendation of the Holy Synod."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_02","To think that our deeds might one day reach the ears of the Holy Synod."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_03","I once knew a priest whose deeds were commended by the Holy Synod. Perhaps one day we will achieve the same."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_a_04","Have courage, Pilgrims. Perhaps once day our deeds will be known to the Holy Synod."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_01","A worthy aim for which to strive, Pilgrim."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_b_02","Only the most virtuous of deeds would ever attract the attention of the Synod!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_01","The Synod holds both temporal and spiritual power. A mighty institution indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_ecclesiarchy_two_c_02","Let us proceed according to our duty, and perhaps recognition will follow."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_01","The mutant is one whose physical form bears the taint of the enemy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_b_02","Humanity is made in the Emperors image. Shun those who deviate from his Great Design."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_four_c_02","The mutant is the tool of the enemy, and is to be purged."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_01","The virtuous have nothing to fear. And yet I see fear in the Psyker's eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_b_02","Luckily the Inquisition do not look to Freaks for approval."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_01","Such folly, to think that you know better than the Emperor's Holy Inquisition."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_three_c_02","Better a thousand innocents should burn than a single heretic walk free."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_a_01","Suffer not the witch to live, so the scriptures tell us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_a_03","There are not enough pyres in the imperium to burn away all the wickedness of witches."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_a_04","Fear the witch, for they corrupt the virtuous by their very nature."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_01","They are weak-willed, conduits for the evil that lies in the Empyrean."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_b_02","Their dark powers are a temptation, and few are able to resist."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_01","All must find the Black Ships, or the pyre."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_enemy_within_two_c_02","Pray for guidance, Pilgrims, that you may stand against the witch when the day comes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_01","The greatest armada the universe has ever seen!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_b_02","Hundreds of thousands of souls, committed to drive Chaos back from whence it came."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_01","Perhaps this will be the last war? [beat] I think not."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_four_c_02","So many fleets scattered across space. How can they possibly be co-ordinated?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_01","Such is the price of hubris."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_b_02","Nothing is eternal except the Emperor. The Cadians learned that to their cost."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_01","We should learn from their example, and embrace holy sacrifice."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_one_c_02","They fought as heroes, and fell as martyrs."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_01","Careful, Pilgrim. Power and corruption walk hand in hand."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_b_02","Just what we needed. More psykers."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_01","But this age is also a time of miracles. The Emperor's eye is also upon us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_three_c_02","A time of witches, a time of miracles. These are the days that try our souls."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_02","I pray for those souls lost in the Imperium Nihilus. May the Emperor grant them mercy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_03","Half of the empire, plunged into darkness by the Great Rift. Imagine."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_a_04","The Empire is divided by the great rift, half in dark and half in light. We are fortunate to be spared."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_01","The Dark Imperium. Never was a place more aptly named."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_b_02","Who knows what terrible deeds took place during the Great Darkness..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_01","The Emperor sees all, even that which is hidden. The Imperium will yet be whole again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_era_indomitus_two_c_02","Blood will be spilt 'ere the Imperium is made whole again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_01","Let them come. All shall be judged in time."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_b_02","A great work lies ahead of us, to winnow the righteous from the damned."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_01","Here lies the path to their redemption. I trust they are grateful."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_four_c_02","They have been granted a great opportunity: to die in service to the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_01","Grendyl is the Beneficent Emperor's right hand. Ask no more questions."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_b_02","No good can come of this line of questioning."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_01","This conversation veers close to heresy. Enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_one_c_02","The Emperor's Holy Inquisition is beyond reproach. And beyond questioning."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_01","Question not the Inquisitor's ways."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_b_02","Would you prefer the Inquisitor was taking a personal interest in you?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_01","The Inquisitor has sent us here to serve. Do your duty, and that will be enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_three_c_02","Waste no more time in questions. Our duty is clear."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_01","We are honoured to serve such a beacon of faith as Inquisitor Grendyl."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_02","In times of doubt, look to the Inquisitor for guidance and you will be led aright."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_03","I am glad to serve such a faithful soul as Grendyl."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_a_04","All that I have seen tells me that Inquisitor Grendyl is above reproach."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_01","I agree. I have witnessed holiness in word and deed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_b_02","The Beneficent Emperor has given us a worthy leader."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_01","Great is the mind too small for doubt. You would all do well to remember that."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_grendyl_two_c_02","Trust in the Beneficent Emperor, and His anointed servant."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_four_b_01","Her words are not meant for you, Ogryn. Nor, in fact, for the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_four_b_02","Make of it what you will, Ogryn. I would prefer a clear translation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_four_c_01","Perhaps you would be good enough to interpret for the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_four_c_02","Listen to me, Slab: there is no possible... oh, never mind."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_one_b_01","I mistrust any who distort their Emperor-Given flesh in such a manner."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_one_b_02","She is more machine than woman. I mislike this."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_one_c_01","The Emperor works in mysterious ways. As does the Cult of Mars."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_one_c_02","You need not like her, only respect her skill."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_three_b_01","Know your place, Psyker. Which is outside our heads, in case that was not clear."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_three_b_02","Lay a finger on my brain, Psyker, and I will have yours spattered across that wall."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_three_c_01","This psyker has been nothing but a distraction from our purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_three_c_02","I counselled against bringing a freak from the start."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_a_01","How old can a Tech-priest live, do you think?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_a_02","The Tech-priest's implants are new, but her flesh seems withered."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_a_03","I wonder when the Tech-priest took her vows. I suspect she is ancient indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_a_04","Those augmetics have sustained the Tech-priest long beyond her allotted span of years."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_b_01","The sum of years are meaningless if not spent in righteous service."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_b_02","A thousand years to serve the God Emperor would not be enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_c_01","The Beneficent Emperor has ordained the hour of her death all the same."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hadron_two_c_02","She should take care that the wisdom of the years does not pave the way to heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_01","I would ask what happened to the last one first."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_b_02","Whatever shall we do without you?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_01","Stay with us and I will put a good work in for you with the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_four_c_02","Perhaps I will enquire as to the nature of this service for myself..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_01","The Purser? The love of coin can be a great deceiver."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_b_02","Ah yes, the Purser. Another troubled soul for this motley crew."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_01","She would rule this place by fear, if the interrogator would only let her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_one_c_02","There is no love lost between her and Interrogator Rannick, I fear."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_01","Alas, we find ourselves in a seller's market."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_b_02","I fear she would sell each of us if she thought she could turn a profit."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_01","The wicked never prosper in the end."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_three_c_02","While we are aboard the Mourningstar we must endure her ways."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_01","A word regarding the purser, Pilgrims. She is not to be trusted."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_02","I had not thought much of Hallowette, but what I saw this morning diminished my opinion of her yet more."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_03","The purser is a loose cannon, dangerous and unpredictable!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_a_04","How the Inquisitor tolerates that purser I have no idea!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_01","She is a pirate, nothing more."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_b_02","Anyone would make a better purser than that one."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_01","It is only a matter of time before her wicked ways are punished, in this life or the next."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hallowette_two_c_02","Beneficent Emperor, smite her for her wickedness!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_01","Those parasites who prey on honest working folk."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_b_02","Those of high birth. Those who consider themselves about the law."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_01","Pride comes before a fall. The high born would do well to remember that."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_four_c_02","All the wealth on Atoma cannot buy a soul's salvation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_01","Gangers are wicked, true enough. But heretics are worse."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_b_02","They must be brought into the Emperor's light... Or into the fire."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_01","Who is the true sinner? The one who steals, or the one who robs the worker of the fruits of their labour?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_one_c_02","Poverty corrupts and diminishes the human soul. If Governors do not feed their people, they must be opposed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_b_01","Then pray tell us what you would build in their place."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_01","Hive dweller or noble, all souls are equal in the Emperor's eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_three_c_02","To turn away from such suffering risks the damnation of millions."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_a_01","The manufactoria of Hive Tertium are vital, so I'm told."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_a_03","Atoma's people slave away in its manufactoria. Suffering is holy, if it has purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_01","And yet if Atoma falls, the secret of forging Moebian steel will be lost forever."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_b_02","The Empire's armies hunger for steel, and must be fed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_01","The manufactoria must be secured, but we must not forget the faithful souls within."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_hive_cities_two_c_02","May the workers find comfort in their duty, and a swift end to their suffering."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_four_b_01","Strive for greatness, Slab, and perhaps the Bell of Lost Souls will toll for you yet."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_four_b_02","Heroes are forged in the crucible of war. I will listen for the Bell of Lost Souls when you fall."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_four_c_01","If this is your goal, then we must seek out yet greater peril!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_four_c_02","Have courage! Perhaps you may yet achieve martyrdom."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_one_b_01","To hang my eyes on Holy Terra... The very thought of it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_one_b_02","One day I will see the Golden Throne, even if not with mortal eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_one_c_01","I pray for Holy Terra, and for the salvation of Mankind."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_one_c_02","A virtuous life is pilgrimage enough for me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_three_b_01","Those who do not tithe soon reap a bitter harvest."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_three_b_02","To leave the tithe unpaid benefits no one, least of all the common people."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_three_c_01","The Imperium is the sum of its parts. There is no place for those who take but do not give."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_three_c_02","The virtuous embrace a life of service to the Emperor with a glad heart."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_two_a_01","A million worlds, all beneath the Beneficent Emperor's glorious banner..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_two_a_03","Have you ever seen a clear night sky? A million worlds, held in the Emperor's gaze."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_two_b_01","And yet there is such darkness between worlds. We must be the bearers of His light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_two_c_01","We will rekindle Atoma's light in His holy name."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_imperium_two_c_02","We must wage Holy War until the galaxy knows His peace."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_01","The point of assassins is that you don't see them. Until it is too late."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_b_02","Better to embrace a venomous snake than an Assassin of the Ordo."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_01","To strike from the shadows is the coward's way."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_four_c_02","We can revisit this topic should an assassin present themself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_01","Some say the world will end in holy fire."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_b_02","Imagine. Every living soul extinguished in a single glorious firestorm."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_01","All is not yet lost. Atoma's salvation may yet be won."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_one_c_02","Then we must not fail, for surely Atoma will pay the price if we do."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_01","You may be above Imperial Law, but the Emperor's eye is upon you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_b_02","Then comport yourself as befits an agent of His Holy Inquisition."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_01","We may be above the law, but the Lex Imperialis must still be our guide."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_three_c_02","The Lex Imperialis must be obeyed, both in letter and in spirit."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_01","As a child, I always longed to join the Ordo Hereticus."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_02","What an honour to serve the Ordo Hereticus. Truly there is no higher calling."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_03","Did any of you ever imagine that you would one day serve the Ordo Hereticus?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_a_04","Ah, the Ordo Hereticus. What better way to serve the Beneficent Emperor?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_01","An honour indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_b_02","We are the hammer of his justice. The task for which I was made."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_01","Ours is a sacred duty indeed. Not even the highest born may escape our scrutiny."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_inquisition_two_c_02","All are equal before the scourge and the flame."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_01","Only the Beneficent Emperor can truly understand. For the rest of us, faith must suffice."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_b_02","To understand its workings would only diminish its wonder."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_01","The Emperor's strength sustains us, and lights the darkness of the void."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_four_c_02","Without the Emperor upon the throne, humanity would be plunged into eternal night."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_01","It is said that on his deathbed he wept, for he knew others would unmake his works."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_b_02","Some say he will return in the hour of the Imperium's greatest need."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_01","In these dark days, we have need of another Solar Macharius."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_one_c_02","I fear the Imperium of Man shall not see his like again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_01","These are the ways of the Enemy, to tempt us from the path of virtue."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_b_02","What you speak is heresy. The Dark Age of Technology almost damned mankind beyond redemption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_01","Look to your scriptures for guidance, not the sinful ways of the past."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_three_c_02","When the Emperor commands me I shall look to the past for wisdom, and not before."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_01","No matter how dark these times, the Age of Apostasy was darker still."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_02","We should speak of the Age of Apostasy, a cautionary tale against false piety and the vanities of the flesh."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_03","I often wonder what would have transpired had the Ecclesiarchy perished in the Age of Apostasy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_a_04","The Imperium has known dark times, but none so dark as the Age of Apostasy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_01","They say the very streets ran with blood, all on the orders of the traitor Vandire."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_b_02","May the Arch-Apostate Vandire suffer a thousand torments."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_01","Without Sebastian Thor and the daughters of the Emperor we should still be in darkness."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_lost_history_two_c_02","Praise be to Sister Alicia Dominica, who took the traitor's head from his shoulders."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_four_b_01","Loyalty is second amongst the virtues, after righteous hatred."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_four_b_02","His deeds have earned no great regard from me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_four_c_01","Too many have hidden a heretic's heart behind a mask of servitude."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_four_c_02","If that loyalty were to falter, I fear what he might do next."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_one_b_01","Lord Melk, he styles himself, though I have seen no patent of nobility."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_one_b_02","Ah yes, the honourable ""Lord Melk."" There is little nobility to the man."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_one_c_01","I have seen his sort abuse the privileges of their rank all too often."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_one_c_02","True nobility is earned through service, not given by right of birth."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_three_b_01","And yet he clings to the trappings of his lost power."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_three_b_02","Still he thinks himself a cut above the rest of us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_three_c_01","He is the same as the rest of us. A lost soul in search of redemption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_three_c_02","He will come to learn that  his birthright cannot save him now."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_a_01","Lord Melk has seen fit to correct my Gothic. My gothic!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_a_02","It seems Lord Melk considers himself my superior in the pronunciation of the scriptures!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_a_03","Lord Melk tells me that my sermon required more practice this morning! The audacity!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_a_04","According to Lord Melk, my Gothic is badly articulated. How dare he?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_b_01","Outrageous. The man knows nothing."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_b_02","You did well not to smite him where he stood!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_c_01","His babble is best ignored."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_melk_two_c_02","What would a disgraced scholar know of such things anyway?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_four_b_01","Surely not. Such a fate would have brought him to the pyre."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_four_b_02","Nonsense. The inquisitor would never allow such taint within his retinue."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_four_c_01","Careful, Pilgrims. It is unwise to speak lightly of such thing. Or, indeed speak at all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_four_c_02","I trust you have evidence for such outrageous claims."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_one_b_01","Surely not. And yet I would not struggle to believe it..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_one_b_02","If that is true, I should like to hear his tales of righteous slaughter."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_one_c_01","Someone should ask him. Slab, he likes you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_one_c_02","May his great deeds inspire us in turn."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_three_b_01","You are not fit to judge him, Psyker."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_three_b_02","Silence, Freak. Your lips are not fit to speak the name of such a hero."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_three_c_01","His skills are beyond dispute. Regardless of the tales, he is a worthy ally."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_three_c_02","Cease this speculation. Following his example should be enough for you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_a_01","Pilgrims! I have learned that Morrow fought at the Battle of Macragge!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_a_02","Who would have believed that Morrow fought the xenos at Macragge!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_a_03","Morrow bears a holy relic of Macragge, entrusted to him by Chaplain Cassius himself!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_a_04","Sergeant Morrow is a hero indeed, a veteran of the first Tyrannic war!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_b_01","Truly the Emperor has blessed him with long years if this is so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_b_02","I will reserve judgement until I see evidence of this with my own eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_c_01","An inspiring story at least."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_morrow_two_c_02","Has anyone asked him? No? Of course not."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_01","Truly the Mourningstar must strike fear into the hearts of our enemies."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_02","The hymns of the Mourningstar's laud-hailers are a blessed inspiration."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_03","How many years has the Mourningstar served the Emperor? What heroic deeds has it seen?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_a_04","Surely the Mourningstar is blessed by the Emperor himself."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_01","Truly it was wrought by righteous hands."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_b_02","A shame that it must stoop to carry so many unworthy souls."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_01","May it bear us swiftly into the war to come."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_mourningstar_one_c_02","Surely its machine spirit hungers for holy war."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_four_b_01","Question not the Inquisitor's design."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_four_b_02","Are you so keen to give up your share of holy slaughter?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_four_c_01","Perhaps he will join us once we have proven our worth."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_four_c_02","It is a mark of trust that he sees fit to guide us from afar."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_one_b_01","He is astute and calculating. Admirable traits."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_one_b_02","I admire his dedication."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_one_c_01","It is obvious he is content with our service. Otherwise we would be dead already."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_one_c_02","I am sworn to obey, and will do so without question."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_three_b_01","Do you suppose he seeks to follow in his master's footsteps?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_three_b_02","To rise in the Holy Inquisition is a considerable aim."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_three_c_01","Such a man would benefit from a spiritual guide. I will offer him my aid."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_three_c_02","Perhaps I should ask him for career advice..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_a_01","I suspect Interrogator Rannick of straying from the path of true faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_a_02","The Interrogator seems... less than faithful of late."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_a_03","Rannick's lack of faith stands in stark contrast to our pious Inquisitor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_a_04","Interrogator Rannick's piety leaves much to be wished for."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_b_01","Strange, that so well connected a man should be so lacking in faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_b_02","Now that you mention it, I do not believe I have heard him utter a word of prayer."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_c_01","If he strays from the path of faith, I fear he will take us with him."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_rannick_two_c_02","We must show obedience: but watch him with care."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_servitors_one_b_01","The flesh still serves, even when the mind is long gone."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_servitors_one_b_02","What thoughts are held within those rotting skulls?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_servitors_one_c_01","Perhaps you will be honoured with such service. I would prefer a cleaner death."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_servitors_one_c_02","They serve, but I must confess my unease. Those blank faces and dead eyes..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_b_01","Such rites are beyond the comprehension of mortal minds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_01","They are angels, made in the Beneficent Emperor's holy image."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_four_c_02","The Adeptus Astartes are to us as we are to the lowest beast of the field."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_01","The Emperor's Holy Angels have more important places to be than this!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_b_02","A thunder hammer is not required to drive in a nail. We are sufficient for this task."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_01","This place would not long withstand the fury of the Space Wolves."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_one_c_02","Imagine the Raven Guard, swooping to cleanse Atoma on night-black wings."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_01","He is risen, as the prophecies foretold."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_b_02","First the Blessed Son returns. Soon, the father will follow."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_01","I pray that one day I may cast my unworthy eyes upon him."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_three_c_02","The son of the God-Emperor walks amongst us. To live in such times is a blessing indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_01","Have any of you read the Codex Astartes?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_02","I have heard that there is a copy of the Codex Astartes on board the Mourningstar!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_03","Guilliman's Codex Astartes is a mighty tome indeed!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_a_04","Truly the Emperor guided the Blessed Guilliman's hand when he penned the Codex Astartes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_01","A divinely inspired volume indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_b_02","I dearly wish to read it myself, and to reflect on the spiritual truths contained within."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_01","The Blessed Roboute teaches humility, service and faith. You should follow his example."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_space_marines_two_c_02","Even the Blessed Primarch knows the worth of humility. You all have no excuse."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_01","Radiant and glorious, as the blessed scriptures depict."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_b_02","A shining beacon of light and majesty. Have you not read your prayer-book?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_01","Conduct your life in virtue, and the sight of his visage will be your heavenly reward."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_four_c_02","None of us may comprehend him in his full glory, at least, not while we draw breath."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_01","Listen, and you will hear his words."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_b_02","The righteous know His will without need of words."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_01","Through the High Lords of Terra is His will made manifest."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_one_c_02","The High Lords of Terra learn his will through signs and portents."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_01","Better a swift and holy death than to endure the temptations of the enemy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_b_02","What would you prefer? That the galaxy endure eternal darkness?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_01","No sacrifice is too small to go unmarked. Their martyrdom is a holy thing."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_three_c_02","I pray for the souls of the lost, and honour their sacrifice."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_01","The Beneficent Emperor was martyred for our sake. So we must follow His example!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_02","The Emperor sits in agony upon the Golden Throne. How can you fail to answer his call?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_03","The Emperor gave His all for humanity. We must not fail him."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_a_04","Our sacrifices are paltry compared to those of the Beneficent Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_01","An act of surpassing love, to immure himself in the Golden Throne for all time."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_b_02","Think of his agonies, all endured willingly for our sake."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_01","Honour him with your deeds, Pilgrims. He asks only that of you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_emperor_two_c_02","When he rises at last, he will know the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_01","It is best not to think too deeply about such things."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_b_02","Great is the mind too small for doubt. These matters are best left unconsidered."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_01","Must we continue? This is a matter for Enginseers and explorators, not virtuous souls."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_four_c_02","It matters not how it is done, only that the Mourningstar keeps us safe from the tempest."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_01","I would question any who do not approach the Warp with fear and dread."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_b_02","The warp is an unclean place. You are wise to fear it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_c_01","I find the mortification of the flesh the best defence against the trials of the Warp."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_one_c_02","I recommend self-flagellation during warp transits. Pain clarifies the mind."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_01","Time may ebb and flow, but the Beneficent Emperor keeps careful count of years and deeds."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_b_02","Time is an illusion in any case. Remember how slowly it passes when we are under fire."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_01","Warp travel is a necessity. I endure it only under sufferance."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_three_c_02","To enter the Warp is to court damnation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_01","I do not care to voyage through the Immaterium. I was watched, I am sure of it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_02","There are unholy creatures lurking in the Warp."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_03","The Warp is the domain of blasphemous ... things."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_a_04","I fear the denizens of the Warp have left their unspeakable mark upon the Mourningstar..."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_01","Warp Entities. Such a bland description for such unspeakable horrors."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_b_02","An unclean place, and those who reside within are filthier still."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_c_01","Enough of this! To dwell too long on the Warp courts damnation."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_the_warp_two_c_02","I have heard enough. Turn your minds to virtue and service, not filth and corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_01","Careful, Slab. Sefoni may not be as she seems."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_b_02","Less time in training and more in prayer would serve you better."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_01","Do not trust her. She may have dark plans for us all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_four_c_02","I will watch you carefully, Ogryn, in case she has corrupted you, too."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_01","Trust your instincts. There is something unclean about her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_b_02","If she is to be a weapon in the Emperor's service, I would not be the hand to wield her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_01","Careful. You may learn more from the witch than you bargained for."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_one_c_02","Learn all you can from the Psyker. One day that knowledge may stand you in good stead."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_01","I find her unsettling. Troublingly so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_b_02","So are the weak of mind corrupted."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_01","Have a care. The unclean corrupt with their very touch."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_three_c_02","Another psyker. Exactly what this mission needs."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_01","I wish to learn nothing that Sefoni can teach."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_02","Why have we been given a psyker to oversee our training? I can think of a dozen more worthy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_03","How is a psyker a suitable tutor for the likes of us?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_a_04","I am horrified that the Inquisitor thinks Sefoni a suitable tutor for us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_01","She makes my flesh creep."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_b_02","The scriptures say ""harken not to the witch."""
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_01","There is little that can be done for now. But consider me displeased."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_training_psyker_two_c_02","I shall have words with the Interrogator over this."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_01","Emperor deliver us from reckless pilots."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_b_02","The landing can never come soon enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_01","You do not understand, any of you!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_valkyrie_one_c_02","Silence! I tire of your foolishness!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_war_end_b_01","The war will end one day, Slab, even if we do not live to see it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_war_end_b_02","If we are true of purpose, our victory is assured."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_war_end_c_01","Waste no thought on the future. To fight today is enough."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_war_end_c_02","Only ask yourself, what evil can you destroy today? Then destroy it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_four_b_01","Pray for purity that you may be spared such an ordeal."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_four_b_02","Only the weak could fall to such corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_four_c_01","There's is a taint which must be purged with fire and the sword."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_four_c_02","These wretched hives of corruption must be dragged shrieking into the light of truth."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_one_b_01","The wickedness of humanity is sufficient challenge for one lifetime."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_one_b_02","Once humanity has been cleansed of sin, then I will turn my mind to the xenos."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_one_c_01","Ignorance is the best defence against the xenos."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_one_c_02","There may be a thousand xenos races, but cleansing fire takes care of them all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_three_b_01","Those who truck with the xenos imperil their very souls."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_three_b_02","The Inquisition may choose to do so. I would not."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_three_c_01","The xenos cannot be trusted. No good will come of it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_three_c_02","They are soulless abominations. Only damnation awaits those who truck with them."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_two_a_01","I have heard that the perfidious Aeldari worship false gods in place of the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_two_a_03","They say the Aeldari worship fragments of cunningly wrought bone. Idolators."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_two_a_04","I once heard that the Aeldari worship many Gods, all of them at war with each other."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_two_b_01","They may look human, but they are soulless abominations."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_two_b_02","Tricksters and deceivers. Death is their just reward."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_two_c_01","The Aeldari have paid the price for the hubris of their forebears."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_xenos_two_c_02","No good can come of a species so deeply steeped in sorcery."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_four_b_01","Her deeds speak for themselves."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_four_b_02","Sister Zola is an asset to our cause."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_four_c_01","You would do well to emulate her."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_four_c_02","We could use more like her amongst our number."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_one_b_01","Her mind is fixed on a higher purpose."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_one_b_02","Yes, not everyone wastes their time in idle chatter."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_one_c_01","She will be judged by her deeds. So will we all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_one_c_02","She will be tested, yes, but I do not believe she will fail us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_three_b_01","I care little for a psyker's judgement."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_three_b_02","Let only the sinless cast stones."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_three_c_01","I will make my own judgement without need of yours."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_three_c_02","We all have doubts and fears. She has made a weapon of her weaknesses."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_a_01","Explicator Zola is a pious soul. You would do well to learn from her faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_a_02","I have not seen such a faith as Sister Zola's in some time. I am impressed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_a_03","If your faith is lacking, look to Sister Zola to guide you."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_a_04","I have passed judgement on the Explicator. [beat]. A righteous soul."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_b_01","I agree. A worthy ally."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_b_02","I do not doubt it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_c_01","You would do well to cleanse your own soul before thinking of others."
"loc_zealot_male_c__lore_zola_two_c_02","There are sinners enough for you to judge. Concern yourself less with the righteous."
"loc_zealot_male_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_01","I have it!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__luggable_mission_pick_up_02","Help me [grunt] bear this burden."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_alarm_01","Find the alarm pilgrims!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_alarm_02","We must silence that damned alarm!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_01","We cannot proceed. The way is closed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_front_door_a_02","I fear we cannot prevail against that door."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_01","The Imperium is its history. Such places as this are holy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_one_a_02","This is a shrine to humanity's achievement. Glorious."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_01","I shall bring all traitors to judgement. You need only point the way."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_three_a_02","Judgement is my calling. I shall gladly seek these traitors."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_01","A proud structure. May it ever remain so."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_mid_conversation_two_a_02","Is it not glorious that this place yet stands?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_01","Alas that we must always take the most unpleasant road."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_archives_start_banter_a_02","[Disgusted Noise] I will never be clean again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","Let us put that train to holy work!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Beneficent Emperor, we give you praise for the gift of this vehicle!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","Of course. Because taking the train would be too easy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Very well. Come, footsore pilgrims, our road is not yet over."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","How did a Tech-Priest such as you find your way to an inquisitorial retinue?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","Tell us, Tech-Priest, how did you come to serve the Emperor in such a manner?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","The truth will find you, Tech-Priest, no matter how carefully you hide."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Half-truths and obfuscations. I should have known."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","If we are not supported soon, our martyrdom is at hand."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","Where is the support team? Why are we forsaken?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_01","I trust there will be something left of us for them to support."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_end_event_conversation_two_c_02","You forgot to send them on time, didn't you?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_01","They toil ardently in the Emperor's name."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_hab_feed_lines_02","Beneficent Emperor, reward these faithful servants for their toil."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_01","Beneficent Emperor, why hast thou forsaken us?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_labyrinth_02","You have led us awry."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_something_big_01","What fell beast could have made such a hole?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_something_big_02","What horror could have caused such destruction?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_01","Soldiers! Why do they stand idle when there is work to be done?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cargo_start_banter_a_02","These soldiers are a disgrace to their uniforms."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","The Water Cartel is no more. So perish all who turn from the Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","I shall not grieve for the Water Cartel. Heretics and wastrels all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","The Beneficent Emperor has passed judgement."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","A fitting fate."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","The heretics consumed the Water Cartel like a weevil eating rotten meat."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The Water Cartel must have grown weak in their corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","Greed has been the downfall of many."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","Power unearned is a swift route to corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","If you ever wish to share a tale of your past, Sister, I am listening."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","How did a soul such as yours come to serve the Inquisition, Sister Zola?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","As you prefer."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","The Emperor sees all, knows all. [pointedly] Judges all."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_insignia_01","The Cartels. So do the powerful prey on the weak."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_insignia_02","The Enforcers should have stamped out these Cartels long ago."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_01","Beneficent Emperor, grant comfort to these suffering souls."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_mudlark_02","What a life... to sift through human waste for sustenance."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_01","This place is rotten with corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_old_hab_02","Who could live in a place such as this?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_01","See how evil turns upon evil?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_reach_bazaar_02","If we leave them long enough, perhaps the heretics will wipe each other out."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_shanty_01","Look at this place. Such suffering. Such sin."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_shanty_02","This place has been sorely neglected."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_water_course_01","Have a care, Pilgrims. A slip here will mean your doom."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cartel_water_course_02","That water... see how it roils with corruption."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_01","The elevator comes! In the meantime, judge all who approach!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_coming_02","Pilgrims! We make our stand here until the elevator arrives!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_01","I do not accept that this comms-plex will serve better than the Mourningstar."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_a_02","There is deceit in this mission, pilgrims. A hidden agenda."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_01","What value is there in striving, if it goes unchallenged?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_1_c_02","Then I am grateful to be in more honest company."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_01","I would be very interested to hear who this transmission is for."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_a_02","I trust the recipient of this transmission is a good, loyal servant."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_01","Secrets everywhere. I shall uncover them. Depend upon it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_2_c_02","A seeker of truth cannot be stalled by silence. Be sure of that."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_01","This message is important, of course. But is it vital?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_a_02","This message is crucial to war?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_01","Acceptable. A worthy mission."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_elevator_conversation_3_c_02","The explanation will serve ... imprecise though it is."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_01","I distrust the veil of secrecy pervading this mission."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_start_banter_a_02","Secrecy is often necessary, but can prove destructive."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_way_in_01","This is no means of ingress for the faithful."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_complex_way_in_02","A judge such as I should enter via the processional ... not this."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_01","What desolation. The sacrosanct rendered profane."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_one_02","How can mortal hands repair such devastation?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_01","What did the Tech-Priest say?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_one_line_three_02","Sorry. Could you repeat that?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_01","What is a manufactorum without its labourers? A body without a soul."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_one_02","The manufactorum stands, but I fear we are too late for the workers."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_01","More sorrow and suffering. [sigh]. One day there will come a reckoning."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_three_line_three_02","And where are the Lords of Atoma, to pay the price for their Heresy?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_01","How can one manufactorum be of such importance?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_one_02","What was made here, that this place should matter so to Rannick?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_01","Then this shall be our sacred duty."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_elevator_conversation_two_line_three_02","I will gladly bleed to armour the soldiers of the Imperium."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_heat_01","This accursed place is as hot as the pyre!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_heat_02","May this heat [gasp] cleanse our souls."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_leaving_01","Can our work here truly be done?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_leaving_02","Sufficient unto the day is the deed. Time for us to leave. "
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_01","Mind your step, Pilgrims. To stumble here is to fall."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_long_way_down_02","We stand on the edge of a precipice - literally, as well as spiritually."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_01","Onward! To the Coolant Control chamber!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_overseer_office_02","This heat cannot endure forever. To the Coolant chamber!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_production_line_01","Leman Russ tank plating."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_production_line_02","Parts of a Leman Russ. Named for an angel of the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_01","A poor life, to spend every moment in such a place."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_cooling_worker_habitation_02","The workers sleep here, while their masters drowse on feather beds. Despicable."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_deception_01","Deceive the heretics? If we must."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_deception_02","This deception is distasteful to me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_01","Here is a place where righteous justice was enacted."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_courtroom_02","It grieves me to see such a place of judgement cast low."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_01","The enforcers have failed this place."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_a_02","Where are the enforcers?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_01","These failed enforcers must be punished for their crimes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_one_c_02","Such failure is unforgivable."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_01","Tell us, explicator, did you grow up in one of these Blocks?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_a_02","I see you know this place, explicator?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_01","I am here when you are ready to confess your sins."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_three_c_02","Then use what you learned in the cause of atonement."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_01","An arch-heretic? Hiding in a prison? Contemptible."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_end_event_conversation_two_a_02","A jail is a fitting place for the arch-heretic."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_01","That does not look stable. Or safe in any way."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_hab_support_02","Some questionable decisions were made in this hab's construction."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_01","The Governor of this planet has failed their people."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_infrastructure_02","How could the Governor of this planet permit such decay?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_01","What a smell. This air is barely breathable."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_start_banter_a_02","That stench! Holy throne."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_01","What unsanctioned goods were traded here, I wonder?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_traders_row_02","This was not a place of virtuous trade, I will wager."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_01","Careful where you step, pilgrim. This is treacherous ground."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_enforcer_wonky_hab_02","This place is slipping into Hel one degree at a time."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_alive_01","The smelter burns with holy fire!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_alive_02","The smelter is revived!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","What holy duty must these tanks undertake?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","These tanks. How have they earned such regard?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","A sacred duty indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","May they be put to good use against the enemy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","Tell me, Tech-Priest, how came you to be here?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","The Tech-Priest keeps her own counsel, I see."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","Perhaps you will come to tell us more in time."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","The Emperor knows your secrets, even if we do not."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","This place yet stands, a bastion of faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","Why have the heretics allowed this place to stand?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","Better, then, that we should destroy it ourselves,"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","We must not allow that fate to befall it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_01","The smelter is our goal. Quickly!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_find_smelter_02","We must find the smelter, and with all haste."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_hellhole_01","Are you so eager to burn? Move!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_hellhole_02","Pilgrims! We leave, lest the fire consume us!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_lifeless_01","Nothing lives here - no human soul nor machine spirit."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_lifeless_02","This place is a barren sepulchre."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_01","There - the main gate! Forward!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_main_entrance_02","The gates are open -- forward!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_propaganda_01","Here there is no time for thought nor prayer. Only labour."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_propaganda_02","If the workers had been granted time for prayer, this place might yet stand."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_01","Stand fast, Pilgrims. Trust in the Emperor."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_stand_ground_02","Hold! Hold! In the Emperor's name!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_01","This place [cough]. How can anyone breathe such air?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_start_banter_a_02","Merciful Emperor. Did anyone pack a respirator?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_01","What secrets does this place hold, that Rannick wants them so?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_forge_strategic_asset_02","Another day, another ruin of key strategic importance."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_hack_01","The machine spirit will yield its secrets."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_hack_02","We will have the truth from this machine spirit."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_propaganda_cultist_town_01","This place is badly in need of cleansing flame."

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_propaganda_infested_elevator_01","Pilgrims, we should take the stairs."

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_propaganda_short_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","The path of virtue is long and arduous. I need a bowl of tanna."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_propaganda_start_banter_a_01","Breathe deeply, pilgrims. Do you taste that, in the air? [beat] No? [beat] Exactly."

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_station_interrogation_bay_a_01","A magistratum catechizer post. Here all the Heresys of the flesh are laid bare."

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_station_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","Easier for you, you mean."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_station_start_banter_a_01","These soldiers could use a rousing sermon to rekindle their faith."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_station_start_banter_a_02","We see you, soldiers! You do the God-Emperor's work!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_station_station_approach_01","Chasm Terminus! We are almost there!"

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_station_the_bridge_01","Look - fighting! To the south!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_station_the_bridge_02","Turn your eyes to the south. The war goes on."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_01","Another hab unit fallen into Heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_cartel_habs_02","Such misery in this place. Who can be surprised the enemy has made it their own?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_01","A daemon in this place. I do not feel ready to face such a foe."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_a_02","Courage, pilgrims. If there is a daemon here, our greatest test is yet to come."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_01","Courage! Faith shall sustain us!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_one_c_02","We must not fail, or all shall be lost."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","We must retake the Torrent. The Emperor wills it."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","We must uproot this heresy, and plant the seeds of virtue."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_01","When the guilty are purged, the innocent may yet be nurtured into virtue."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_three_c_02","Heresy prospers when the virtuous avert their eyes."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_01","This place is far from the Emperor's light."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_a_02","This 'Torrent' is a Heretical place indeed."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_01","And who is there to speak for the common folk?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_elevator_conversation_two_c_02","With the right guidance this place might be returned to the light once again."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_holo_statue_01","A holo statue! See how his holy light shines!"

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_01","There is no path here."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_main_access_02","This gateway shall not help us."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_01","This place is rotten with corruption, inside and out."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_ruined_hab_02","Behold this corrosion. The wages of Heresy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_01","Behold the cleansing of the water. Truly this is holy work."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_stockpile_start_banter_a_02","As water is cleansed, so is the light of the Emperor a balm to the mortal soul."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_01","What would happen if that atmospheric shield were to fail?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_atmosphere_shield_02","That atmospheric shield does not look... healthy."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_crossroads_01","God Emperor, guide us out of this place before we perish."

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_inert_tanks_01","These are not the tanks we seek. Onward!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_inert_tanks_02","Empty as a heretics prayer. We must continue our search."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_01","Let me guess. That's where we're going."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_one_b_02","There is no way that can possibly go wrong."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_01","I wish we had taken the stairs."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_a_02","[yelps] Are we sure this elevator is safe?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_01","Beneficent Emperor, grant me your mercy in this, the hour of my death."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_three_b_02","Surely the Emperor would not bring us all this distance for us to perish in such a way?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_01","Fire, bolter and the sword. Understood."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_elevator_conversation_two_b_02","We shall be the instrument of its cleansing!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_a_01","We have a daemon. Because of course we do."

"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_01","We must cleanse it, no matter the cost."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_one_c_02","We shall slay it, in the Emperor's name."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_01","Do we know how this... pathogen spreads?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_a_02","What are the symptoms of this... contagion? Does anyone else feel warm?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_01","I shall be glad to leave this place."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_three_c_02","Forgive me if I am not wholly reassured."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_01","What do you mean by 'pathogen'?"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_a_02","Pathogen'? That sounds like heresy to me."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_01","A corruption, I see. It will burn like all of its kind."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_mid_event_conversation_two_c_02","We shall drive it from this place with our prayers!"
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_start_banter_a_01","Another ruin. I am starting to think nothing of this planet is standing."
"loc_zealot_male_c__mission_strain_start_banter_a_02","Surely there can be nothing on Atoma worth saving. Look around you!"
